CLOSELY APPROACHING SEEMED TO BE DISCUSSING SOME SUBJECT WITH GREAT EARNESTNESS FOR CONVENIENCE SAKE WE HAVE SAID HITHERTO TWO GENTLEMEN ONE OF THE PARTIES HOWEVER WHEN CRITICALLY EXAMINED DID NOT

IN A DEVIL OF A HURRY AND SHALL WANT TO KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WHAT I MAY DEPEND ON SAID HE RISING AND PUTTING ON HIS OVERCOAT WELL CALL UP THIS EVENING BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN AND YOU SHALL HAVE MY ANSWER SAID MR SHELBY AND THE TRADER BOWED HIMSELF OUT OF THE APARTMENT ID LIKE TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO KICK THE FELLOW DOWN THE STEPS SAID HE TO HIMSELF AS HE SAW THE DOOR FAIRLY CLOSED WITH HIS IMPUDENT ASSURANCE BUT HE KNOWS HOW MUCH HE HAS ME AT ADVANTAGE IF ANYBODY HAD EVER SAID TO ME THAT I SHOULD SELL TOM DOWN SOUTH TO ONE OF THOSE RASCALLY TRADERS I SHOULD HAVE SAID IS THY SERVANT A DOG THAT HE SHOULD DO THIS THING AND NOW IT MUST COME FOR AUGHT I SEE AND ELIZAS CHILD TOO I KNOW THAT I SHALL HAVE SOME FUSS WITH WIFE ABOUT THAT AND FOR THAT MATTER ABOUT TOM TOO SO MUCH FOR BEING IN DEBTHEIGHO THE FELLOW SEES HIS ADVANTAGE AND MEANS TO PUSH IT PERHAPS THE MILDEST FORM OF THE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY IS TO BE SEEN IN THE STATE OF KENTUCKY THE GENERAL PREVALENCE OF AGRICULTURAL PURSUITS OF A QUIET AND GRADUAL NATURE NOT REQUIRING THOSE PERIODIC SEASONS OF HURRY AND PRESSURE THAT ARE CALLED FOR IN THE BUSINESS OF MORE SOUTHERN DISTRICTS MAKES THE TASK OF THE NEGRO A MORE HEALTHFUL AND REASONABLE ONE WHILE THE MASTER CONTENT WITH A MORE GRADUAL STYLE OF ACQUISITION HAS NOT THOSE TEMPTATIONS TO HARDHEARTEDNESS WHICH ALWAYS OVERCOME FRAIL HUMAN NATURE WHEN THE PROSPECT OF SUDDEN AND RAPID GAIN IS WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE WITH NO HEAVIER COUNTERPOISE THAN THE INTERESTS OF THE HELPLESS AND UNPROTECTED WHOEVER VISITS SOME ESTATES THERE AND WITNESSES THE GOODHUMORED INDULGENCE OF SOME MASTERS AND MISTRESSES AND THE AFFECTIONATE LOYALTY OF SOME SLAVES MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO DREAM THE OFTFABLED POETIC LEGEND OF A PATRIARCHAL INSTITUTION AND ALL THAT BUT OVER AND ABOVE THE SCENE THERE BROODS A PORTENTOUS SHADOWTHE SHADOW OF LAW SO LONG AS THE LAW CONSIDERS ALL THESE HUMAN BEINGS WITH BEATING HEARTS AND LIVING AFFECTIONS ONLY AS SO MANY THINGS BELONGING TO A MASTERSO LONG AS THE FAILURE OR MISFORTUNE OR IMPRUDENCE OR DEATH OF THE KINDEST OWNER MAY CAUSE THEM ANY DAY TO EXCHANGE A LIFE OF KIND PROTECTION AND INDULGENCE FOR ONE OF HOPELESS MISERY AND TOILSO LONG IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ANYTHING BEAUTIFUL OR DESIRABLE IN THE BEST REGULATED ADMINISTRATION OF SLAVERY MR SHELBY WAS A FAIR AVERAGE KIND OF MAN GOODNATURED AND KINDLY AND DISPOSED TO EASY INDULGENCE OF THOSE AROUND HIM AND THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A LACK OF ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PHYSICAL COMFORT OF THE NEGROES ON HIS ESTATE HE HAD HOWEVER SPECULATED LARGELY AND QUITE LOOSELY HAD INVOLVED HIMSELF DEEPLY AND HIS NOTES TO A LARGE AMOUNT HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF HALEY AND THIS SMALL PIECE OF INFORMATION IS THE KEY TO THE PRECEDING CONVERSATION NOW IT HAD SO HAPPENED THAT IN APPROACHING THE DOOR ELIZA HAD CAUGHT ENOUGH OF THE CONVERSATION TO KNOW THAT A TRADER WAS MAKING OFFERS TO HER MASTER FOR SOMEBODY SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE STOPPED AT THE DOOR TO LISTEN AS SHE CAME OUT BUT HER MISTRESS JUST THEN CALLING SHE WAS OBLIGED TO HASTEN AWAY STILL SHE THOUGHT SHE HEARD THE TRADER MAKE AN OFFER FOR HER BOYCOULD SHE BE MISTAKEN HER HEART SWELLED AND THROBBED AND SHE INVOLUNTARILY STRAINED HIM SO TIGHT THAT THE LITTLE FELLOW LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE IN ASTONISHMENT ELIZA GIRL WHAT AILS YOU TODAY SAID HER MISTRESS WHEN ELIZA HAD UPSET THE WASHPITCHER KNOCKED DOWN THE WORKSTAND AND FINALLY WAS ABSTRACTEDLY OFFERING HER MISTRESS A LONG NIGHTGOWN IN PLACE OF THE SILK DRESS SHE HAD ORDERED HER TO BRING FROM THE WARDROBE ELIZA STARTED O MISSIS SHE SAID RAISING HER EYES THEN BURSTING INTO TEARS SHE SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR AND BEGAN SOBBING WHY ELIZA CHILD WHAT AILS YOU SAID HER MISTRESS O MISSIS MISSIS SAID ELIZA THERES BEEN A TRADER TALKING WITH MASTER IN THE PARLOR I HEARD HIM WELL SILLY CHILD SUPPOSE THERE HAS O MISSIS DO YOU SUPPOSE MASR WOULD SELL MY HARRY AND THE POOR CREATURE THREW HERSELF INTO A CHAIR AND SOBBED CONVULSIVELY SELL HIM NO YOU FOOLISH GIRL YOU KNOW YOUR MASTER NEVER DEALS WITH THOSE SOUTHERN TRADERS AND NEVER MEANS TO SELL ANY OF HIS SERVANTS AS LONG AS THEY BEHAVE WELL WHY YOU SILLY CHILD WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD WANT TO BUY YOUR HARRY DO YOU THINK ALL THE WORLD ARE SET ON HIM AS YOU ARE YOU GOOSIE COME CHEER UP AND HOOK MY DRESS THERE NOW PUT MY BACK HAIR UP IN THAT PRETTY BRAID YOU LEARNT THE OTHER DAY AND DONT GO LISTENING AT DOORS ANY MORE WELL BUT MISSIS YOU NEVER WOULD GIVE YOUR CONSENTTOTO NONSENSE CHILD TO BE SURE I SHOULDNT WHAT DO YOU TALK SO FOR I WOULD AS SOON HAVE ONE OF MY OWN CHILDREN SOLD BUT REALLY ELIZA YOU ARE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO PROUD OF THAT LITTLE FELLOW A MAN CANT PUT HIS NOSE INTO THE DOOR BUT YOU THINK HE MUST BE COMING TO BUY HIM REASSURED BY HER MISTRESS CONFIDENT TONE ELIZA PROCEEDED NIMBLY AND ADROITLY WITH HER TOILET LAUGHING AT HER OWN FEARS AS SHE PROCEEDED MRS SHELBY WAS A WOMAN OF HIGH CLASS BOTH INTELLECTUALLY AND MORALLY TO THAT NATURAL MAGNANIMITY AND GENEROSITY OF MIND WHICH ONE OFTEN MARKS AS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE WOMEN OF KENTUCKY SHE ADDED HIGH MORAL AND RELIGIOUS SENSIBILITY AND PRINCIPLE CARRIED OUT WITH GREAT ENERGY AND ABILITY INTO PRACTICAL RESULTS HER HUSBAND WHO MADE NO PROFESSIONS TO ANY PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS CHARACTER NEVERTHELESS REVERENCED AND RESPECTED THE CONSISTENCY OF HERS AND STOOD PERHAPS A LITTLE IN AWE OF HER OPINION CERTAIN IT WAS THAT HE GAVE HER UNLIMITED SCOPE IN ALL HER BENEVOLENT EFFORTS FOR THE COMFORT INSTRUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT OF HER SERVANTS THOUGH HE NEVER TOOK ANY DECIDED PART IN THEM HIMSELF IN FACT IF NOT EXACTLY A BELIEVER IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE EFFICIENCY OF THE EXTRA GOOD WORKS OF SAINTS HE REALLY SEEMED SOMEHOW OR OTHER TO FANCY THAT HIS WIFE HAD PIETY AND BENEVOLENCE ENOUGH FOR TWOTO INDULGE A SHADOWY EXPECTATION OF GETTING INTO HEAVEN THROUGH HER SUPERABUNDANCE OF QUALITIES TO WHICH HE MADE NO PARTICULAR PRETENSION THE HEAVIEST LOAD ON HIS MIND AFTER HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE TRADER LAY IN THE FORESEEN NECESSITY OF BREAKING TO HIS WIFE THE ARRANGEMENT CONTEMPLATEDMEETING THE IMPORTUNITIES AND OPPOSITION WHICH HE KNEW HE SHOULD HAVE REASON TO ENCOUNTER MRS SHELBY BEING ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF HER HUSBANDS EMBARRASSMENTS AND KNOWING ONLY THE GENERAL KINDLINESS OF HIS TEMPER HAD BEEN QUITE SINCERE IN THE ENTIRE INCREDULITY WITH WHICH SHE HAD MET ELIZAS SUSPICIONS IN FACT SHE DISMISSED THE MATTER FROM HER MIND WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT AND BEING OCCUPIED IN PREPARATIONS FOR AN EVENING VISIT IT PASSED OUT OF HER THOUGHTS ENTIRELY CHAPTER II THE MOTHER ELIZA HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP BY HER MISTRESS FROM GIRLHOOD AS A PETTED AND INDULGED FAVORITE THE TRAVELLER IN THE SOUTH MUST OFTEN HAVE REMARKED THAT PECULIAR AIR OF REFINEMENT THAT SOFTNESS OF VOICE AND MANNER WHICH SEEMS IN MANY CASES TO BE A PARTICULAR GIFT TO THE QUADROON AND MULATTO WOMEN THESE NATURAL GRACES IN THE QUADROON ARE OFTEN UNITED WITH BEAUTY OF THE MOST DAZZLING KIND AND IN ALMOST EVERY CASE WITH A PERSONAL APPEARANCE PREPOSSESSING AND AGREEABLE ELIZA SUCH AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED HER IS NOT A FANCY SKETCH BUT TAKEN FROM REMEMBRANCE AS WE SAW HER YEARS AGO IN KENTUCKY SAFE UNDER THE PROTECTING CARE OF HER MISTRESS ELIZA HAD REACHED MATURITY WITHOUT THOSE TEMPTATIONS WHICH MAKE BEAUTY SO FATAL AN INHERITANCE TO A SLAVE SHE HAD BEEN MARRIED TO A BRIGHT AND TALENTED YOUNG MULATTO MAN WHO WAS A SLAVE ON A NEIGHBORING ESTATE AND BORE THE NAME OF GEORGE HARRIS THIS YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN HIRED OUT BY HIS MASTER TO WORK IN A BAGGING FACTORY WHERE HIS ADROITNESS AND INGENUITY CAUSED HIM TO BE CONSIDERED THE FIRST HAND IN THE PLACE HE HAD INVENTED A MACHINE FOR THE CLEANING OF THE HEMP WHICH CONSIDERING THE EDUCATION AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INVENTOR DISPLAYED QUITE AS MUCH MECHANICAL GENIUS AS WHITNEYS COTTONGIN A MACHINE OF THIS DESCRIPTION WAS REALLY THE INVENTION OF A YOUNG COLORED MAN IN KENTUCKY MRS STOWES NOTE HE WAS POSSESSED OF A HANDSOME PERSON AND PLEASING MANNERS AND WAS A GENERAL FAVORITE IN THE FACTORY NEVERTHELESS AS THIS YOUNG MAN WAS IN THE EYE OF THE LAW NOT A MAN BUT A THING ALL THESE SUPERIOR QUALIFICATIONS WERE SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF A VULGAR NARROWMINDED TYRANNICAL MASTER THIS SAME GENTLEMAN HAVING HEARD OF THE FAME OF GEORGES INVENTION TOOK A RIDE OVER TO THE FACTORY TO SEE WHAT THIS INTELLIGENT CHATTEL HAD BEEN ABOUT HE WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM BY THE EMPLOYER WHO CONGRATULATED HIM ON POSSESSING SO VALUABLE A SLAVE HE WAS WAITED UPON OVER THE FACTORY SHOWN THE MACHINERY BY GEORGE WHO IN HIGH SPIRITS TALKED SO FLUENTLY HELD HIMSELF SO ERECT LOOKED SO HANDSOME AND MANLY THAT HIS MASTER BEGAN TO FEEL AN UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS OF INFERIORITY WHAT BUSINESS HAD HIS SLAVE TO BE MARCHING ROUND THE COUNTRY INVENTING MACHINES AND HOLDING UP HIS HEAD AMONG GENTLEMEN HED SOON PUT A STOP TO IT HED TAKE HIM BACK AND PUT HIM TO HOEING AND DIGGING AND SEE IF HED STEP ABOUT SO SMART ACCORDINGLY THE MANUFACTURER AND ALL HANDS CONCERNED WERE ASTOUNDED WHEN HE SUDDENLY DEMANDED GEORGES WAGES AND ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF TAKING HIM HOME BUT MR HARRIS REMONSTRATED THE MANUFACTURER ISNT THIS RATHER SUDDEN WHAT IF IT ISISNT THE MAN MINE WE WOULD BE WILLING SIR TO INCREASE THE RATE OF COMPENSATION NO OBJECT AT ALL SIR I DONT NEED TO HIRE ANY OF MY HANDS OUT UNLESS IVE A MIND TO BUT SIR HE SEEMS PECULIARLY ADAPTED TO THIS BUSINESS DARE SAY HE MAY BE NEVER WAS MUCH ADAPTED TO ANYTHING THAT I SET HIM ABOUT ILL BE BOUND BUT ONLY THINK OF HIS INVENTING THIS MACHINE INTERPOSED ONE OF THE WORKMEN RATHER UNLUCKILY O YES A MACHINE FOR SAVING WORK IS IT HED INVENT THAT ILL BE BOUND LET A NIGGER ALONE FOR THAT ANY TIME THEY ARE ALL LABORSAVING MACHINES THEMSELVES EVERY ONE OF EM NO HE SHALL TRAMP GEORGE HAD STOOD LIKE ONE TRANSFIXED AT HEARING HIS DOOM THUS SUDDENLY PRONOUNCED BY A POWER THAT HE KNEW WAS IRRESISTIBLE HE FOLDED HIS ARMS TIGHTLY PRESSED IN HIS LIPS BUT A WHOLE VOLCANO OF BITTER FEELINGS BURNED IN HIS BOSOM AND SENT STREAMS OF FIRE THROUGH HIS VEINS HE BREATHED SHORT AND HIS LARGE DARK EYES FLASHED LIKE LIVE COALS AND HE MIGHT HAVE BROKEN OUT INTO SOME DANGEROUS EBULLITION HAD NOT THE KINDLY MANUFACTURER TOUCHED HIM ON THE ARM AND SAID IN A LOW TONE GIVE WAY GEORGE GO WITH HIM FOR THE PRESENT WELL TRY TO HELP YOU YET THE TYRANT OBSERVED THE WHISPER AND CONJECTURED ITS IMPORT THOUGH HE COULD NOT HEAR WHAT WAS SAID AND HE INWARDLY STRENGTHENED HIMSELF IN HIS DETERMINATION TO KEEP THE POWER HE POSSESSED OVER HIS VICTIM GEORGE WAS TAKEN HOME AND PUT TO THE MEANEST DRUDGERY OF THE FARM HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO REPRESS EVERY DISRESPECTFUL WORD BUT THE FLASHING EYE THE GLOOMY AND TROUBLED BROW WERE PART OF A NATURAL LANGUAGE THAT COULD NOT BE REPRESSEDINDUBITABLE SIGNS WHICH SHOWED TOO PLAINLY THAT THE MAN COULD NOT BECOME A THING IT WAS DURING THE HAPPY PERIOD OF HIS EMPLOYMENT IN THE FACTORY THAT GEORGE HAD SEEN AND MARRIED HIS WIFE DURING THAT PERIODBEING MUCH TRUSTED AND FAVORED BY HIS EMPLOYERHE HAD FREE LIBERTY TO COME AND GO AT DISCRETION THE MARRIAGE WAS HIGHLY APPROVED OF BY MRS SHELBY WHO WITH A LITTLE WOMANLY COMPLACENCY IN MATCHMAKING FELT PLEASED TO UNITE HER HANDSOME FAVORITE WITH ONE OF HER OWN CLASS WHO SEEMED IN EVERY WAY SUITED TO HER AND SO THEY WERE MARRIED IN HER MISTRESS GREAT PARLOR AND HER MISTRESS HERSELF ADORNED THE BRIDES BEAUTIFUL HAIR WITH ORANGEBLOSSOMS AND THREW OVER IT THE BRIDAL VEIL WHICH CERTAINLY COULD SCARCE HAVE RESTED ON A FAIRER HEAD AND THERE WAS NO LACK OF WHITE GLOVES AND CAKE AND WINEOF ADMIRING GUESTS TO PRAISE THE BRIDES BEAUTY AND HER MISTRESS INDULGENCE AND LIBERALITY FOR A YEAR OR TWO ELIZA SAW HER HUSBAND FREQUENTLY AND THERE WAS NOTHING TO INTERRUPT THEIR HAPPINESS EXCEPT THE LOSS OF TWO INFANT CHILDREN TO WHOM SHE WAS PASSIONATELY ATTACHED AND WHOM SHE MOURNED WITH A GRIEF SO INTENSE AS TO CALL FOR GENTLE REMONSTRANCE FROM HER MISTRESS WHO SOUGHT WITH MATERNAL ANXIETY TO DIRECT HER NATURALLY PASSIONATE FEELINGS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF REASON AND RELIGION AFTER THE BIRTH OF LITTLE HARRY HOWEVER SHE HAD GRADUALLY BECOME TRANQUILLIZED AND SETTLED AND EVERY BLEEDING TIE AND THROBBING NERVE ONCE MORE ENTWINED WITH THAT LITTLE LIFE SEEMED TO BECOME SOUND AND HEALTHFUL AND ELIZA WAS A HAPPY WOMAN UP TO THE TIME THAT HER HUSBAND WAS RUDELY TORN FROM HIS KIND EMPLOYER AND BROUGHT UNDER THE IRON SWAY OF HIS LEGAL OWNER THE MANUFACTURER TRUE TO HIS WORD VISITED MR HARRIS A WEEK OR TWO AFTER GEORGE HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY WHEN AS HE HOPED THE HEAT OF THE OCCASION HAD PASSED AWAY AND TRIED EVERY POSSIBLE INDUCEMENT TO LEAD HIM TO RESTORE HIM TO HIS FORMER EMPLOYMENT YOU NEEDNT TROUBLE YOURSELF TO TALK ANY LONGER SAID HE DOGGEDLY I KNOW MY OWN BUSINESS SIR I DID NOT PRESUME TO INTERFERE WITH IT SIR I ONLY THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT THINK IT FOR YOUR INTEREST TO LET YOUR MAN TO US ON THE TERMS PROPOSED O I UNDERSTAND THE MATTER WELL ENOUGH I SAW YOUR WINKING AND WHISPERING THE DAY I TOOK HIM OUT OF THE FACTORY BUT YOU DONT COME IT OVER ME THAT WAY ITS A FREE COUNTRY SIR THE MANS MINE AND I DO WHAT I PLEASE WITH HIMTHATS IT AND SO FELL GEORGES LAST HOPENOTHING BEFORE HIM BUT A LIFE OF TOIL AND DRUDGERY RENDERED

TERROR IN ANY REFLECTING FOWL LIVING HER CORNCAKE IN ALL ITS VARIETIES OF HOECAKE DODGERS MUFFINS AND OTHER SPECIES TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION WAS A SUBLIME MYSTERY TO ALL LESS PRACTISED COMPOUNDERS AND SHE WOULD SHAKE HER FAT SIDES WITH HONEST PRIDE AND MERRIMENT AS SHE WOULD NARRATE THE FRUITLESS EFFORTS THAT ONE AND ANOTHER OF HER COMPEERS HAD MADE TO ATTAIN TO HER ELEVATION THE ARRIVAL OF COMPANY

A FRIEND WHOM SHE LOVED AND REVERED THEN THERE WAS THE PARTING FROM EVERY FAMILIAR OBJECTTHE PLACE WHERE SHE HAD GROWN UP THE TREES UNDER WHICH SHE HAD PLAYED THE GROVES WHERE SHE HAD WALKED MANY AN EVENING IN HAPPIER DAYS BY THE SIDE OF HER YOUNG HUSBANDEVERYTHING AS IT LAY IN THE CLEAR FROSTY STARLIGHT SEEMED TO SPEAK REPROACHFULLY TO HER AND ASK HER WHITHER COULD SHE GO FROM A HOME LIKE THAT BUT STRONGER THAN ALL WAS MATERNAL LOVE WROUGHT INTO A PAROXYSM OF FRENZY BY THE NEAR APPROACH OF A FEARFUL DANGER HER BOY WAS OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE WALKED BY HER SIDE AND IN AN INDIFFERENT CASE SHE WOULD ONLY HAVE LED HIM BY THE HAND BUT NOW THE BARE THOUGHT OF PUTTING HIM OUT OF HER ARMS MADE HER SHUDDER AND SHE STRAINED HIM TO HER BOSOM WITH A CONVULSIVE GRASP AS SHE WENT RAPIDLY FORWARD THE FROSTY GROUND CREAKED BENEATH HER FEET AND SHE TREMBLED AT THE SOUND EVERY QUAKING LEAF AND FLUTTERING SHADOW SENT THE BLOOD BACKWARD TO HER HEART AND QUICKENED HER FOOTSTEPS SHE WONDERED WITHIN HERSELF AT THE STRENGTH THAT SEEMED TO BE COME UPON HER FOR SHE FELT THE WEIGHT OF HER BOY AS IF IT HAD BEEN A FEATHER AND EVERY FLUTTER OF FEAR SEEMED TO INCREASE THE SUPERNATURAL POWER THAT BORE HER

GET ME NO SO MAY GOD HELP ME SAID HIS MOTHER WITH A PALER CHEEK AND A BRIGHTER LIGHT IN HER LARGE DARK EYES YOURE SURE ANT YOU MOTHER YES SURE SAID THE MOTHER IN A VOICE THAT STARTLED HERSELF FOR IT SEEMED TO HER TO COME FROM A SPIRIT WITHIN THAT WAS NO PART OF HER AND THE BOY DROPPED HIS LITTLE WEARY HEAD ON HER SHOULDER AND WAS SOON ASLEEP HOW THE TOUCH OF THOSE WARM ARMS THE GENTLE BREATHINGS THAT CAME IN HER NECK SEEMED TO ADD FIRE AND SPIRIT TO HER MOVEMENTS IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF STRENGTH POURED INTO HER IN ELECTRIC STREAMS FROM EVERY GENTLE TOUCH AND MOVEMENT OF THE SLEEPING CONFIDING CHILD SUBLIME IS THE DOMINION OF THE MIND OVER THE BODY THAT FOR A TIME CAN MAKE FLESH AND NERVE IMPREGNABLE AND STRING THE SINEWS LIKE STEEL SO THAT THE WEAK BECOME SO MIGHTY THE BOUNDARIES OF THE FARM THE GROVE THE WOODLOT PASSED BY HER DIZZILY AS SHE WALKED ON AND STILL SHE WENT LEAVING ONE FAMILIAR OBJECT AFTER ANOTHER SLACKING NOT PAUSING NOT TILL REDDENING DAYLIGHT FOUND HER MANY A LONG MILE FROM ALL TRACES OF ANY FAMILIAR OBJECTS UPON THE OPEN HIGHWAY SHE HAD OFTEN BEEN WITH HER MISTRESS TO VISIT SOME CONNECTIONS IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF T NOT FAR FROM THE OHIO RIVER AND KNEW THE ROAD WELL TO GO THITHER TO ESCAPE ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER WERE THE FIRST HURRIED OUTLINES OF HER PLAN OF ESCAPE BEYOND THAT SHE COULD ONLY HOPE IN GOD WHEN HORSES AND VEHICLES BEGAN TO MOVE ALONG THE HIGHWAY WITH THAT ALERT PERCEPTION PECULIAR TO A STATE OF EXCITEMENT AND WHICH SEEMS TO BE A SORT OF INSPIRATION SHE BECAME AWARE THAT HER HEADLONG PACE AND DISTRACTED AIR MIGHT BRING ON HER REMARK AND SUSPICION SHE THEREFORE PUT THE BOY ON THE GROUND AND ADJUSTING HER DRESS AND BONNET SHE WALKED ON AT AS RAPID A PACE AS SHE THOUGHT CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESERVATION OF APPEARANCES IN HER LITTLE BUNDLE SHE HAD PROVIDED A STORE OF CAKES AND APPLES WHICH SHE USED AS EXPEDIENTS FOR QUICKENING THE SPEED OF THE CHILD ROLLING THE APPLE SOME YARDS BEFORE THEM WHEN THE BOY WOULD RUN WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AFTER IT AND THIS RUSE OFTEN REPEATED CARRIED THEM OVER MANY A HALFMILE AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO A THICK PATCH OF WOODLAND THROUGH WHICH MURMURED A CLEAR BROOK AS THE CHILD COMPLAINED OF HUNGER AND THIRST SHE CLIMBED OVER THE FENCE WITH HIM AND SITTING DOWN BEHIND A LARGE ROCK WHICH CONCEALED THEM FROM THE ROAD SHE GAVE HIM A BREAKFAST OUT OF HER LITTLE PACKAGE THE BOY WONDERED AND GRIEVED THAT SHE COULD NOT EAT AND WHEN PUTTING HIS ARMS ROUND HER NECK HE TRIED TO WEDGE SOME OF HIS CAKE INTO HER MOUTH IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THE RISING IN HER THROAT WOULD CHOKE HER NO NO HARRY DARLING MOTHER CANT EAT TILL YOU ARE SAFE WE MUST GO ONONTILL WE COME TO THE RIVER AND SHE HURRIED AGAIN INTO THE ROAD AND AGAIN CONSTRAINED HERSELF TO WALK REGULARLY AND COMPOSEDLY FORWARD SHE WAS MANY MILES PAST ANY NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE SHE WAS PERSONALLY KNOWN IF SHE SHOULD CHANCE TO MEET ANY WHO KNEW HER SHE REFLECTED THAT THE WELLKNOWN KINDNESS OF THE FAMILY WOULD BE OF ITSELF A BLIND TO SUSPICION AS MAKING IT AN UNLIKELY SUPPOSITION THAT SHE COULD BE A FUGITIVE AS SHE WAS ALSO SO WHITE AS NOT TO BE KNOWN AS OF COLORED LINEAGE WITHOUT A CRITICAL SURVEY AND HER CHILD WAS WHITE ALSO IT WAS MUCH EASIER FOR HER TO PASS ON UNSUSPECTED ON THIS PRESUMPTION SHE STOPPED AT NOON AT A NEAT FARMHOUSE TO REST HERSELF AND BUY SOME DINNER FOR HER CHILD AND SELF FOR AS THE DANGER DECREASED WITH THE DISTANCE THE SUPERNATURAL TENSION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM LESSENED AND SHE FOUND HERSELF BOTH WEARY AND HUNGRY THE GOOD WOMAN KINDLY AND GOSSIPPING SEEMED RATHER PLEASED THAN OTHERWISE WITH HAVING

TODAY YOU AND ANDY MUST BE HUNGRY MISSIS IS A HEAP TOO GOOD FOR US SAID SAM MAKING HIS BOW WITH ALACRITY AND DEPARTING IT WILL BE PERCEIVED AS HAS BEEN BEFORE INTIMATED THAT MASTER SAM HAD A NATIVE TALENT THAT MIGHT UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE RAISED HIM TO EMINENCE IN POLITICAL LIFEA TALENT OF MAKING CAPITAL OUT OF EVERYTHING THAT TURNED UP TO BE INVESTED FOR HIS OWN ESPECIAL PRAISE AND GLORY AND HAVING DONE UP HIS PIETY AND HUMILITY AS HE TRUSTED TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE PARLOR HE CLAPPED HIS PALMLEAF ON HIS HEAD WITH A SORT OF RAKISH FREEANDEASY AIR AND PROCEEDED TO THE DOMINIONS OF AUNT CHLOE WITH THE INTENTION OF FLOURISHING LARGELY IN THE KITCHEN ILL SPEECHIFY THESE YER NIGGERS SAID SAM TO HIMSELF NOW IVE GOT A CHANCE LORD ILL REEL IT OFF TO MAKE EM STARE IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT ONE OF SAMS ESPECIAL DELIGHTS HAD BEEN TO RIDE IN ATTENDANCE ON HIS MASTER TO ALL KINDS OF POLITICAL GATHERINGS WHERE ROOSTED ON SOME RAIL FENCE OR PERCHED ALOFT IN SOME TREE HE WOULD SIT WATCHING THE ORATORS WITH THE GREATEST APPARENT GUSTO AND THEN DESCENDING AMONG THE VARIOUS BRETHREN OF HIS OWN COLOR ASSEMBLED ON THE SAME ERRAND HE WOULD EDIFY AND DELIGHT THEM WITH THE MOST LUDICROUS BURLESQUES AND IMITATIONS ALL DELIVERED WITH THE MOST IMPERTURBABLE EARNESTNESS AND SOLEMNITY AND THOUGH THE AUDITORS IMMEDIATELY ABOUT HIM WERE GENERALLY OF HIS OWN COLOR IT NOT INFREQUENTLY HAPPENED THAT THEY WERE FRINGED PRETTY DEEPLY WITH THOSE OF A FAIRER COMPLEXION WHO LISTENED LAUGHING AND WINKING TO SAMS GREAT SELFCONGRATULATION IN FACT SAM CONSIDERED ORATORY AS HIS VOCATION AND NEVER LET SLIP AN OPPORTUNITY OF MAGNIFYING HIS OFFICE NOW BETWEEN SAM AND AUNT CHLOE THERE HAD EXISTED FROM ANCIENT TIMES A SORT OF CHRONIC FEUD OR RATHER A DECIDED COOLNESS BUT AS SAM WAS MEDITATING SOMETHING IN THE PROVISION DEPARTMENT AS THE NECESSARY AND OBVIOUS FOUNDATION OF HIS OPERATIONS HE DETERMINED ON THE PRESENT OCCASION TO BE EMINENTLY CONCILIATORY FOR HE WELL KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH MISSIS ORDERS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE FOLLOWED TO THE LETTER YET HE SHOULD GAIN A CONSIDERABLE DEAL BY ENLISTING THE SPIRIT ALSO HE THEREFORE APPEARED BEFORE AUNT CHLOE WITH A TOUCHINGLY SUBDUED RESIGNED EXPRESSION LIKE ONE WHO HAS SUFFERED IMMEASURABLE HARDSHIPS IN BEHALF OF A PERSECUTED FELLOWCREATUREENLARGED UPON THE FACT THAT MISSIS HAD DIRECTED HIM TO COME TO AUNT CHLOE FOR WHATEVER MIGHT BE WANTING TO MAKE UP THE BALANCE IN HIS SOLIDS AND FLUIDSAND THUS UNEQUIVOCALLY ACKNOWLEDGED HER RIGHT AND SUPREMACY IN THE COOKING DEPARTMENT AND ALL THERETO PERTAINING THE THING TOOK ACCORDINGLY NO POOR SIMPLE VIRTUOUS BODY WAS EVER CAJOLED BY THE ATTENTIONS OF AN ELECTIONEERING POLITICIAN WITH MORE EASE THAN AUNT CHLOE WAS WON OVER BY MASTER SAMS SUAVITIES AND IF HE HAD BEEN THE PRODIGAL SON HIMSELF HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH MORE MATERNAL BOUNTIFULNESS AND HE SOON FOUND HIMSELF SEATED HAPPY AND GLORIOUS OVER A LARGE TIN PAN CONTAINING A SORT OF OLLA PODRIDA OF ALL THAT HAD APPEARED ON THE TABLE FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS PAST SAVORY MORSELS OF HAM GOLDEN BLOCKS OF CORNCAKE FRAGMENTS OF PIE OF EVERY CONCEIVABLE MATHEMATICAL FIGURE CHICKEN WINGS GIZZARDS AND DRUMSTICKS ALL APPEARED IN PICTURESQUE

CROWDED IN FROM THE VARIOUS CABINS TO HEAR THE TERMINATION OF THE DAYS EXPLOITS NOW WAS SAMS HOUR OF GLORY THE STORY OF THE DAY WAS REHEARSED WITH ALL KINDS OF ORNAMENT AND VARNISHING WHICH MIGHT BE

AND GLITTERED ON THE SIDES OF THE TEACUPS AND WELLBRIGHTENED TEAPOT AS SENATOR BIRD WAS DRAWING OFF HIS BOOTS PREPARATORY TO INSERTING HIS FEET IN A PAIR OF NEW HANDSOME SLIPPERS WHICH HIS WIFE HAD BEEN WORKING FOR HIM WHILE AWAY ON HIS SENATORIAL TOUR MRS BIRD LOOKING THE VERY PICTURE OF DELIGHT WAS SUPERINTENDING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE TABLE EVER AND ANON MINGLING ADMONITORY REMARKS TO A

ITS A TIRESOME BUSINESS THIS LEGISLATING AND THE SENATOR SMILED AS IF HE RATHER LIKED THE IDEA OF CONSIDERING HIMSELF A SACRIFICE TO HIS COUNTRY WELL SAID HIS WIFE AFTER THE BUSINESS OF THE TEATABLE WAS GETTING RATHER SLACK AND WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN DOING IN THE SENATE NOW IT WAS A VERY UNUSUAL THING FOR GENTLE LITTLE MRS BIRD EVER TO TROUBLE HER HEAD WITH WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE HOUSE OF THE STATE VERY WISELY CONSIDERING THAT SHE HAD ENOUGH TO DO TO MIND HER OWN MR BIRD THEREFORE OPENED HIS EYES IN SURPRISE AND SAID NOT VERY MUCH OF IMPORTANCE WELL BUT IS IT TRUE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PASSING A LAW FORBIDDING PEOPLE TO GIVE MEAT AND DRINK TO THOSE POOR COLORED FOLKS THAT COME ALONG I HEARD THEY WERE TALKING OF SOME SUCH LAW BUT I DIDNT THINK ANY CHRISTIAN LEGISLATURE WOULD PASS IT WHY MARY YOU ARE GETTING TO BE A POLITICIAN ALL AT ONCE NO NONSENSE I WOULDNT GIVE A FIG FOR ALL YOUR POLITICS GENERALLY BUT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING DOWNRIGHT CRUEL AND UNCHRISTIAN I HOPE MY DEAR NO SUCH LAW HAS BEEN PASSED THERE HAS BEEN A LAW PASSED FORBIDDING PEOPLE TO HELP OFF THE SLAVES THAT COME OVER FROM KENTUCKY MY DEAR SO MUCH OF THAT THING HAS BEEN DONE BY THESE RECKLESS ABOLITIONISTS THAT OUR BRETHREN IN KENTUCKY ARE VERY STRONGLY EXCITED AND IT SEEMS NECESSARY AND NO MORE THAN CHRISTIAN AND KIND THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE BY OUR STATE TO QUIET THE EXCITEMENT AND WHAT IS THE LAW IT DONT FORBID US TO SHELTER THOSE POOR CREATURES A NIGHT DOES IT AND TO GIVE EM SOMETHING COMFORTABLE TO EAT AND A FEW OLD CLOTHES AND SEND THEM QUIETLY ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS WHY YES MY DEAR THAT WOULD BE AIDING AND ABETTING YOU KNOW MRS BIRD WAS A TIMID BLUSHING LITTLE WOMAN OF ABOUT FOUR FEET IN HEIGHT AND WITH MILD BLUE EYES AND A PEACHBLOW COMPLEXION AND THE GENTLEST SWEETEST VOICE IN THE WORLDAS FOR COURAGE A MODERATESIZED COCKTURKEY HAD BEEN KNOWN TO PUT HER TO ROUT AT THE VERY FIRST GOBBLE AND A STOUT HOUSEDOG OF MODERATE CAPACITY WOULD BRING HER INTO SUBJECTION MERELY BY A SHOW OF HIS TEETH HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN WERE HER ENTIRE WORLD AND IN THESE SHE RULED MORE BY ENTREATY AND PERSUASION THAN BY COMMAND OR ARGUMENT THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING THAT WAS CAPABLE OF AROUSING HER AND THAT PROVOCATION CAME IN ON THE SIDE OF HER UNUSUALLY GENTLE AND SYMPATHETIC NATUREANYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF CRUELTY WOULD THROW HER INTO A PASSION WHICH WAS THE MORE ALARMING AND INEXPLICABLE IN PROPORTION TO THE GENERAL SOFTNESS OF HER NATURE GENERALLY THE MOST INDULGENT AND EASY TO BE ENTREATED OF ALL MOTHERS STILL HER BOYS HAD A VERY REVERENT REMEMBRANCE OF A MOST VEHEMENT CHASTISEMENT SHE ONCE BESTOWED ON THEM BECAUSE SHE FOUND THEM LEAGUED WITH SEVERAL GRACELESS BOYS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD STONING A DEFENCELESS KITTEN ILL TELL YOU WHAT MASTER BILL USED TO SAY I WAS SCARED THAT TIME

OUTSIDE THE DOOR WHICH MADE ME FEEL WORSE THAN ALL THE REST ILL TELL YOU WHAT HED SAY WE BOYS NEVER STONED ANOTHER KITTEN ON THE PRESENT OCCASION MRS BIRD ROSE QUICKLY WITH VERY RED CHEEKS WHICH QUITE IMPROVED HER GENERAL APPEARANCE AND WALKED UP TO HER HUSBAND WITH QUITE A RESOLUTE AIR AND SAID IN A DETERMINED TONE NOW JOHN I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU THINK SUCH A LAW AS THAT IS RIGHT AND CHRISTIAN YOU WONT SHOOT ME NOW MARY IF I SAY I DO I NEVER COULD HAVE THOUGHT IT OF YOU JOHN YOU DIDNT VOTE FOR IT EVEN SO MY FAIR POLITICIAN YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED JOHN POOR HOMELESS HOUSELESS CREATURES ITS A SHAMEFUL WICKED ABOMINABLE LAW AND ILL BREAK IT FOR ONE THE FIRST TIME I GET A CHANCE AND I HOPE I SHALL HAVE A CHANCE I DO THINGS HAVE GOT TO A PRETTY PASS IF A WOMAN CANT GIVE A WARM SUPPER AND A BED TO POOR STARVING CREATURES JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE SLAVES AND HAVE BEEN ABUSED AND OPPRESSED ALL THEIR LIVES POOR THINGS BUT MARY JUST LISTEN TO ME YOUR FEELINGS ARE ALL QUITE RIGHT DEAR AND INTERESTING AND I LOVE YOU FOR THEM BUT THEN DEAR WE MUSTNT SUFFER OUR FEELINGS TO RUN AWAY WITH OUR JUDGMENT YOU MUST CONSIDER ITS A MATTER OF PRIVATE FEELINGTHERE ARE GREAT PUBLIC INTERESTS INVOLVEDTHERE IS SUCH A STATE OF PUBLIC AGITATION RISING THAT WE MUST PUT ASIDE OUR PRIVATE FEELINGS NOW JOHN I DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT POLITICS BUT I CAN READ MY BIBLE AND THERE I SEE THAT I MUST FEED THE HUNGRY CLOTHE THE NAKED AND COMFORT THE DESOLATE AND THAT BIBLE I MEAN TO FOLLOW BUT IN CASES WHERE YOUR DOING SO WOULD INVOLVE A GREAT PUBLIC EVIL OBEYING GOD NEVER BRINGS ON PUBLIC EVILS I KNOW IT CANT ITS ALWAYS SAFEST ALL ROUND TO DO AS HE BIDS US NOW LISTEN TO ME MARY AND I CAN STATE TO YOU A VERY CLEAR ARGUMENT TO SHOW O NONSENSE JOHN YOU CAN TALK ALL NIGHT BUT YOU WOULDNT DO IT I PUT IT TO YOU JOHNWOULD YOU NOW TURN AWAY A POOR SHIVERING HUNGRY CREATURE FROM YOUR DOOR BECAUSE HE WAS A RUNAWAY WOULD YOU NOW NOW IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD OUR SENATOR HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO BE A MAN WHO HAD A PARTICULARLY HUMANE AND ACCESSIBLE NATURE AND TURNING AWAY ANYBODY THAT WAS IN TROUBLE NEVER HAD BEEN HIS FORTE AND WHAT WAS WORSE FOR HIM IN THIS PARTICULAR PINCH OF THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT HIS WIFE KNEW IT AND OF COURSE WAS MAKING AN ASSAULT ON RATHER AN INDEFENSIBLE POINT SO HE HAD RECOURSE TO THE USUAL MEANS OF GAINING TIME FOR SUCH CASES MADE AND PROVIDED HE SAID AHEM AND COUGHED SEVERAL TIMES TOOK OUT HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF AND BEGAN TO WIPE HIS GLASSES MRS BIRD SEEING THE DEFENCELESS CONDITION OF THE ENEMYS TERRITORY HAD NO MORE CONSCIENCE THAN TO PUSH HER ADVANTAGE I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU DOING THAT JOHNI REALLY SHOULD TURNING A WOMAN OUT OF DOORS IN A SNOWSTORM FOR INSTANCE OR MAY BE YOUD TAKE HER UP AND PUT HER IN JAIL WOULDNT YOU YOU WOULD MAKE A GREAT HAND

NATIVE STATE HAD NOT BEEN EXCEEDED BY ANY OF HIS BRETHREN AT WASHINGTON IN THE SORT OF ELOQUENCE WHICH HAS WON FOR THEM IMMORTAL RENOWN HOW SUBLIMELY HE HAD SAT WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND SCOUTED ALL SENTIMENTAL WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO WOULD PUT THE WELFARE OF A FEW MISERABLE FUGITIVES BEFORE GREAT STATE INTERESTS HE WAS AS BOLD AS A LION ABOUT IT AND MIGHTILY CONVINCED NOT ONLY HIMSELF BUT EVERYBODY THAT HEARD HIMBUT THEN HIS IDEA OF A FUGITIVE WAS ONLY AN IDEA OF THE LETTERS THAT SPELL THE WORDOR AT THE MOST THE IMAGE OF A LITTLE NEWSPAPER PICTURE OF A MAN WITH A STICK AND BUNDLE

OFF QUIETLY AND NO SCREAMINGHAPPENS BEAUTIFULI LIKE TO DO EVERYTHING QUIETLYI HATES ALL KIND OF AGITATION AND FLUSTER AND SO AFTER A TRANSFER OF CERTAIN BILLS HAD PASSED FROM THE MANS POCKETBOOK TO THE TRADERS HE RESUMED HIS CIGAR IT WAS A BRIGHT TRANQUIL EVENING WHEN THE BOAT STOPPED AT THE WHARF AT LOUISVILLE THE WOMAN HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HER BABY IN HER ARMS NOW WRAPPED IN A HEAVY SLEEP WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF THE PLACE CALLED OUT SHE HASTILY LAID THE CHILD DOWN IN A LITTLE CRADLE FORMED BY THE HOLLOW AMONG THE BOXES FIRST CAREFULLY SPREADING UNDER IT HER CLOAK AND THEN SHE SPRUNG TO THE SIDE OF THE BOAT IN HOPES THAT AMONG THE VARIOUS HOTELWAITERS WHO THRONGED THE WHARF SHE MIGHT SEE HER HUSBAND IN THIS HOPE SHE PRESSED FORWARD TO THE FRONT RAILS AND STRETCHING FAR OVER THEM STRAINED HER EYES INTENTLY ON THE MOVING HEADS ON THE SHORE AND THE CROWD PRESSED IN BETWEEN HER AND THE CHILD NOWS YOUR TIME SAID HALEY TAKING THE SLEEPING CHILD UP AND HANDING HIM TO THE STRANGER DONT WAKE HIM UP AND SET HIM TO CRYING NOW IT WOULD MAKE A DEVIL OF A FUSS WITH THE GAL THE MAN TOOK THE BUNDLE CAREFULLY AND WAS SOON LOST IN THE CROWD THAT WENT UP THE WHARF WHEN THE BOAT CREAKING AND GROANING AND PUFFING HAD LOOSED FROM THE WHARF AND WAS BEGINNING SLOWLY TO STRAIN HERSELF ALONG THE WOMAN RETURNED TO HER OLD SEAT THE TRADER WAS SITTING THERETHE CHILD WAS GONE WHY WHYWHERE SHE BEGAN IN BEWILDERED SURPRISE LUCY SAID THE TRADER YOUR CHILDS GONE YOU MAY AS WELL KNOW IT FIRST AS LAST YOU SEE I KNOWD YOU COULDNT TAKE HIM DOWN SOUTH AND I GOT A CHANCE TO SELL HIM TO A FIRSTRATE FAMILY THATLL RAISE HIM BETTER THAN YOU CAN THE TRADER HAD ARRIVED AT THAT STAGE OF CHRISTIAN AND POLITICAL PERFECTION WHICH HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED BY SOME PREACHERS AND POLITICIANS OF THE NORTH LATELY IN WHICH HE HAD COMPLETELY OVERCOME EVERY HUMANE WEAKNESS AND PREJUDICE HIS HEART WAS EXACTLY WHERE YOURS SIR AND MINE COULD BE BROUGHT WITH PROPER EFFORT AND CULTIVATION THE WILD LOOK OF ANGUISH AND UTTER DESPAIR THAT THE WOMAN CAST ON HIM MIGHT HAVE DISTURBED ONE LESS PRACTISED BUT HE WAS USED TO IT HE HAD SEEN THAT SAME LOOK HUNDREDS OF TIMES YOU CAN GET USED TO SUCH THINGS TOO MY FRIEND AND IT IS THE GREAT OBJECT OF RECENT EFFORTS TO MAKE OUR WHOLE NORTHERN COMMUNITY USED TO THEM FOR THE GLORY OF THE UNION SO THE TRADER ONLY REGARDED THE MORTAL ANGUISH WHICH HE SAW WORKING IN THOSE DARK FEATURES THOSE CLENCHED HANDS AND SUFFOCATING BREATHINGS AS NECESSARY INCIDENTS OF THE TRADE AND MERELY CALCULATED WHETHER SHE WAS GOING TO SCREAM AND GET UP A COMMOTION ON THE BOAT FOR LIKE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF OUR PECULIAR INSTITUTION HE DECIDEDLY DISLIKED AGITATION BUT THE WOMAN DID NOT SCREAM THE SHOT HAD PASSED TOO STRAIGHT AND DIRECT THROUGH THE HEART FOR CRY OR TEAR DIZZILY SHE SAT DOWN HER SLACK HANDS FELL LIFELESS BY HER SIDE HER EYES LOOKED STRAIGHT FORWARD BUT SHE SAW NOTHING ALL THE NOISE AND HUM OF THE BOAT THE GROANING OF THE MACHINERY MINGLED DREAMILY TO HER BEWILDERED EAR AND THE POOR DUMBSTRICKEN HEART HAD NEITHER CRY NOT TEAR TO SHOW FOR ITS UTTER MISERY SHE WAS QUITE CALM THE TRADER WHO CONSIDERING HIS ADVANTAGES WAS ALMOST AS HUMANE AS SOME OF OUR POLITICIANS SEEMED TO FEEL CALLED ON TO ADMINISTER SUCH CONSOLATION AS THE CASE ADMITTED OF I KNOW THIS YER COMES KINDER HARD AT FIRST LUCY SAID HE BUT SUCH A SMART SENSIBLE GAL AS YOU ARE WONT GIVE WAY TO IT YOU SEE ITS NECESSARY AND CANT BE HELPED O DONT MASR DONT SAID THE WOMAN WITH A VOICE LIKE ONE THAT IS SMOTHERING YOURE A SMART WENCH LUCY HE PERSISTED I MEAN TO DO WELL BY YE AND GET YE A NICE PLACE DOWN RIVER AND YOULL SOON GET ANOTHER HUSBANDSUCH A LIKELY GAL AS YOU O MASR IF YOU ONLY WONT TALK TO ME NOW SAID THE WOMAN IN A VOICE OF SUCH QUICK AND LIVING ANGUISH THAT THE TRADER FELT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING AT PRESENT IN THE CASE BEYOND HIS STYLE OF OPERATION HE GOT UP AND THE WOMAN TURNED AWAY AND BURIED HER HEAD IN HER CLOAK THE TRADER WALKED UP AND DOWN FOR A TIME AND OCCASIONALLY STOPPED AND LOOKED AT HER TAKES IT HARD RATHER HE SOLILOQUIZED BUT QUIET THOLET HER SWEAT A WHILE SHELL COME RIGHT BY AND BY TOM HAD WATCHED THE WHOLE TRANSACTION FROM FIRST TO LAST AND HAD A PERFECT UNDERSTANDING OF ITS RESULTS TO HIM IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING UNUTTERABLY HORRIBLE AND CRUEL BECAUSE POOR IGNORANT BLACK SOUL HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO GENERALIZE AND TO TAKE ENLARGED VIEWS IF HE HAD ONLY BEEN INSTRUCTED BY CERTAIN MINISTERS OF CHRISTIANITY HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND SEEN IN IT AN EVERYDAY INCIDENT OF A LAWFUL TRADE A TRADE WHICH IS THE VITAL SUPPORT OF AN INSTITUTION WHICH AN AMERICAN DIVINE TELLS US HAS NO EVILS BUT SUCH AS ARE INSEPARABLE FROM ANY OTHER RELATIONS IN SOCIAL AND DOMESTIC LIFE BUT TOM AS WE SEE BEING A POOR IGNORANT FELLOW WHOSE READING HAD BEEN CONFINED ENTIRELY TO THE NEW TESTAMENT COULD NOT COMFORT AND SOLACE HIMSELF WITH VIEWS LIKE THESE HIS VERY SOUL BLED WITHIN HIM FOR WHAT SEEMED TO HIM THE WRONGS OF THE POOR SUFFERING THING THAT LAY LIKE A CRUSHED REED ON THE BOXES THE FEELING LIVING BLEEDING YET IMMORTAL THING WHICH AMERICAN STATE LAW COOLLY CLASSES WITH THE BUNDLES AND BALES AND BOXES AMONG WHICH SHE IS LYING DR JOEL PARKER OF PHILADELPHIA MRS STOWES NOTE PRESBYTERIAN CLERGYMAN A FRIEND OF THE BEECHER FAMILY MRS STOWE ATTEMPTED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO HAVE THIS IDENTIFYING NOTE REMOVED FROM THE STEREOTYPEPLATE OF THE FIRST EDITION TOM DREW NEAR AND TRIED TO SAY SOMETHING BUT SHE ONLY GROANED HONESTLY AND WITH TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS OWN CHEEKS HE SPOKE OF A HEART OF LOVE IN THE SKIES OF A PITYING JESUS AND AN ETERNAL HOME BUT THE EAR WAS DEAF WITH ANGUISH AND THE PALSIED HEART COULD NOT FEEL NIGHT CAME ONNIGHT CALM UNMOVED AND GLORIOUS SHINING DOWN WITH HER INNUMERABLE AND SOLEMN ANGEL EYES TWINKLING BEAUTIFUL BUT SILENT THERE WAS NO SPEECH NOR LANGUAGE NO PITYING VOICE OR HELPING HAND FROM THAT DISTANT SKY ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE VOICES OF BUSINESS OR PLEASURE DIED AWAY ALL ON THE BOAT WERE SLEEPING AND THE RIPPLES AT THE PROW WERE PLAINLY HEARD TOM STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT ON A BOX AND THERE AS HE LAY HE HEARD EVER AND ANON A SMOTHERED SOB OR CRY FROM THE PROSTRATE CREATUREO WHAT SHALL I DO O LORD O GOOD LORD DO HELP ME AND SO EVER AND ANON UNTIL THE MURMUR DIED AWAY IN SILENCE AT MIDNIGHT TOM WAKED WITH A SUDDEN START SOMETHING BLACK PASSED QUICKLY BY HIM TO THE SIDE OF THE BOAT AND HE HEARD A SPLASH IN THE WATER NO ONE ELSE SAW OR HEARD ANYTHING HE RAISED HIS HEADTHE WOMANS PLACE WAS VACANT HE GOT UP AND SOUGHT ABOUT HIM IN VAIN THE POOR BLEEDING HEART WAS STILL AT LAST AND THE RIVER RIPPLED AND DIMPLED JUST AS BRIGHTLY AS IF IT HAD NOT CLOSED ABOVE IT PATIENCE PATIENCE YE WHOSE HEARTS SWELL INDIGNANT AT WRONGS LIKE THESE NOT ONE THROB OF ANGUISH NOT ONE TEAR OF THE OPPRESSED IS FORGOTTEN BY THE MAN OF SORROWS THE LORD OF GLORY IN HIS PATIENT GENEROUS BOSOM HE BEARS THE ANGUISH OF A WORLD BEAR THOU LIKE HIM IN PATIENCE AND LABOR IN LOVE FOR SURE AS HE IS GOD THE YEAR OF HIS REDEEMED SHALL COME THE TRADER WAKED UP BRIGHT AND EARLY AND CAME OUT TO SEE TO HIS LIVE STOCK IT WAS NOW HIS TURN TO LOOK ABOUT IN PERPLEXITY WHERE ALIVE IS THAT GAL HE SAID TO TOM TOM WHO HAD LEARNED THE WISDOM OF KEEPING COUNSEL DID NOT FEEL CALLED UPON TO STATE HIS OBSERVATIONS AND SUSPICIONS BUT SAID HE DID NOT KNOW SHE SURELY COULDNT HAVE GOT OFF IN THE NIGHT AT ANY OF THE LANDINGS FOR I WAS AWAKE AND ON THE LOOKOUT WHENEVER THE BOAT STOPPED I NEVER TRUST THESE YER THINGS TO OTHER FOLKS THIS SPEECH WAS ADDRESSED TO TOM QUITE CONFIDENTIALLY AS IF IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE SPECIALLY INTERESTING TO HIM TOM MADE NO ANSWER THE TRADER SEARCHED THE BOAT FROM STEM TO STERN AMONG BOXES BALES AND BARRELS AROUND THE MACHINERY BY THE CHIMNEYS IN VAIN NOW I SAY TOM BE FAIR ABOUT THIS YER HE SAID WHEN AFTER A FRUITLESS SEARCH HE CAME WHERE TOM WAS STANDING YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW DONT TELL MEI KNOW YOU DO I SAW THE GAL STRETCHED OUT HERE ABOUT TEN OCLOCK AND AGIN AT TWELVE AND AGIN BETWEEN ONE AND TWO AND THEN AT FOUR SHE WAS GONE AND YOU WAS A SLEEPING RIGHT THERE ALL THE TIME NOW YOU KNOW SOMETHINGYOU CANT HELP IT WELL MASR SAID TOM TOWARDS MORNING SOMETHING BRUSHED BY ME AND I KINDER HALF WOKE AND THEN I HEARN A GREAT SPLASH AND THEN I CLARE WOKE UP AND THE GAL WAS GONE THATS ALL I KNOW ON T THE TRADER WAS NOT SHOCKED NOR AMAZED BECAUSE AS WE SAID BEFORE HE WAS USED TO A GREAT MANY THINGS THAT YOU ARE NOT USED TO EVEN THE AWFUL PRESENCE OF DEATH STRUCK NO SOLEMN CHILL UPON HIM HE HAD SEEN DEATH MANY TIMESMET HIM IN THE WAY OF TRADE AND GOT ACQUAINTED WITH HIMAND HE ONLY THOUGHT OF HIM AS A HARD CUSTOMER THAT EMBARRASSED HIS PROPERTY OPERATIONS VERY UNFAIRLY AND SO HE ONLY SWORE THAT THE GAL WAS A BAGGAGE AND THAT HE WAS DEVILISH UNLUCKY AND THAT IF THINGS WENT ON IN THIS WAY HE SHOULD NOT MAKE A CENT ON THE TRIP IN SHORT HE SEEMED TO CONSIDER HIMSELF AN ILLUSED MAN DECIDEDLY BUT THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT AS THE WOMAN HAD ESCAPED INTO A STATE WHICH NEVER WILL GIVE UP A FUGITIVENOT EVEN AT THE DEMAND OF THE WHOLE GLORIOUS UNION THE TRADER THEREFORE SAT DISCONTENTEDLY DOWN WITH HIS LITTLE ACCOUNTBOOK AND PUT DOWN THE MISSING BODY AND SOUL UNDER THE HEAD OF LOSSES HES A SHOCKING CREATURE ISNT HETHIS TRADER SO UNFEELING ITS DREADFUL REALLY O BUT NOBODY THINKS ANYTHING OF THESE TRADERS THEY ARE UNIVERSALLY DESPISEDNEVER RECEIVED INTO ANY DECENT SOCIETY BUT WHO SIR MAKES THE TRADER WHO IS MOST TO BLAME THE ENLIGHTENED CULTIVATED INTELLIGENT MAN WHO SUPPORTS THE SYSTEM OF WHICH THE TRADER IS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OR THE POOR TRADER HIMSELF YOU MAKE THE PUBLIC STATEMENT THAT CALLS FOR HIS TRADE THAT DEBAUCHES AND DEPRAVES HIM TILL HE FEELS NO SHAME IN IT AND IN WHAT ARE YOU BETTER THAN HE ARE YOU EDUCATED AND HE IGNORANT YOU HIGH AND HE LOW YOU REFINED AND HE COARSE YOU TALENTED AND HE SIMPLE IN THE DAY OF A FUTURE JUDGMENT THESE VERY CONSIDERATIONS MAY MAKE IT MORE TOLERABLE FOR HIM THAN FOR YOU IN CONCLUDING THESE LITTLE INCIDENTS OF LAWFUL TRADE WE MUST BEG THE WORLD NOT TO THINK THAT AMERICAN LEGISLATORS ARE ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF HUMANITY AS MIGHT PERHAPS BE UNFAIRLY INFERRED FROM THE GREAT EFFORTS MADE IN OUR NATIONAL BODY TO PROTECT AND

REALITY SCARCELY LESS VISIONARY AND SPLENDID WHAT OTHER RIVER OF THE WORLD BEARS ON ITS BOSOM TO THE OCEAN THE WEALTH AND ENTERPRISE OF SUCH ANOTHER COUNTRYA COUNTRY WHOSE PRODUCTS EMBRACE ALL BETWEEN THE TROPICS AND THE POLES THOSE TURBID WATERS HURRYING FOAMING TEARING ALONG AN APT RESEMBLANCE OF THAT HEADLONG TIDE OF BUSINESS WHICH IS POURED ALONG ITS WAVE BY A RACE MORE VEHEMENT AND ENERGETIC THAN ANY THE OLD WORLD EVER SAW AH WOULD THAT THEY DID NOT ALSO BEAR ALONG A MORE FEARFUL FREIGHTTHE TEARS OF THE OPPRESSED THE SIGHS OF THE HELPLESS THE BITTER PRAYERS OF POOR IGNORANT HEARTS TO AN UNKNOWN GODUNKNOWN UNSEEN AND SILENT BUT WHO WILL YET COME OUT OF HIS PLACE TO SAVE ALL THE POOR OF THE EARTH THE SLANTING LIGHT OF THE SETTING SUN QUIVERS ON THE SEALIKE EXPANSE OF THE RIVER THE SHIVERY CANES AND THE TALL DARK CYPRESS HUNG WITH WREATHS OF DARK FUNEREAL MOSS GLOW IN THE GOLDEN RAY AS THE HEAVILYLADEN STEAMBOAT MARCHES ONWARD PILED WITH COTTONBALES FROM MANY A PLANTATION UP OVER DECK AND SIDES TILL SHE SEEMS IN THE DISTANCE A SQUARE MASSIVE BLOCK OF GRAY SHE MOVES HEAVILY ONWARD TO THE NEARING MART WE MUST LOOK SOME TIME AMONG ITS CROWDED DECKS BEFORE WE SHALL FIND AGAIN OUR HUMBLE FRIEND TOM HIGH ON THE UPPER DECK IN A LITTLE NOOK AMONG THE EVERYWHERE PREDOMINANT COTTONBALES AT LAST WE MAY FIND HIM PARTLY FROM CONFIDENCE INSPIRED BY MR SHELBYS REPRESENTATIONS AND PARTLY FROM THE REMARKABLY INOFFENSIVE AND QUIET CHARACTER OF THE MAN TOM HAD INSENSIBLY WON HIS WAY FAR INTO THE CONFIDENCE EVEN OF SUCH A MAN AS HALEY AT FIRST HE HAD WATCHED HIM NARROWLY THROUGH THE DAY AND NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO SLEEP AT NIGHT UNFETTERED BUT THE UNCOMPLAINING PATIENCE AND APPARENT CONTENTMENT OF TOMS MANNER LED HIM GRADUALLY TO DISCONTINUE THESE RESTRAINTS AND FOR SOME TIME TOM HAD ENJOYED A SORT OF PAROLE OF HONOR BEING PERMITTED TO COME AND GO FREELY WHERE HE PLEASED ON THE BOAT EVER QUIET AND OBLIGING AND MORE THAN READY TO LEND A HAND IN EVERY EMERGENCY WHICH OCCURRED AMONG THE WORKMEN BELOW HE HAD WON THE GOOD OPINION OF ALL THE HANDS AND SPENT MANY HOURS IN HELPING THEM WITH AS HEARTY A GOOD WILL AS EVER HE WORKED ON A KENTUCKY FARM WHEN THERE SEEMED TO BE NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO HE WOULD CLIMB TO A NOOK AMONG THE COTTONBALES OF THE UPPER DECK AND BUSY HIMSELF IN STUDYING OVER HIS BIBLEAND IT IS THERE WE SEE HIM NOW FOR A HUNDRED OR MORE MILES ABOVE NEW ORLEANS THE RIVER IS HIGHER THAN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY AND ROLLS ITS TREMENDOUS VOLUME BETWEEN MASSIVE LEVEES TWENTY FEET IN HEIGHT THE TRAVELLER FROM THE DECK OF THE STEAMER AS FROM SOME FLOATING CASTLE TOP OVERLOOKS THE WHOLE COUNTRY FOR MILES AND MILES AROUND TOM THEREFORE HAD SPREAD OUT FULL BEFORE HIM IN PLANTATION AFTER PLANTATION A MAP OF THE LIFE TO WHICH HE WAS APPROACHING HE SAW THE DISTANT SLAVES AT THEIR TOIL HE SAW AFAR THEIR VILLAGES OF HUTS GLEAMING OUT IN LONG ROWS ON MANY A PLANTATION DISTANT FROM THE STATELY MANSIONS AND PLEASUREGROUNDS OF THE MASTERAND AS THE MOVING PICTURE PASSED ON HIS POOR FOOLISH HEART WOULD BE TURNING BACKWARD TO THE KENTUCKY FARM WITH ITS OLD SHADOWY BEECHESTO THE MASTERS HOUSE WITH ITS WIDE COOL HALLS AND NEAR BY THE LITTLE CABIN OVERGROWN WITH THE MULTIFLORA AND BIGNONIA THERE HE SEEMED TO SEE FAMILIAR FACES OF COMRADES WHO HAD GROWN UP WITH HIM FROM INFANCY HE SAW HIS BUSY WIFE BUSTLING IN HER PREPARATIONS FOR HIS EVENING MEALS HE HEARD THE MERRY LAUGH OF HIS BOYS AT THEIR PLAY AND THE CHIRRUP OF THE BABY AT HIS KNEE AND THEN WITH A START ALL FADED AND HE SAW AGAIN THE CANEBRAKES AND CYPRESSES AND GLIDING PLANTATIONS AND HEARD AGAIN THE CREAKING AND GROANING OF THE MACHINERY ALL TELLING HIM TOO PLAINLY THAT ALL THAT PHASE OF LIFE HAD GONE BY FOREVER IN SUCH A CASE YOU WRITE TO YOUR WIFE AND SEND MESSAGES TO YOUR CHILDREN BUT TOM COULD NOT WRITETHE MAIL FOR HIM HAD NO EXISTENCE AND THE GULF OF SEPARATION WAS UNBRIDGED BY EVEN A FRIENDLY WORD OR SIGNAL IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SOME TEARS FALL ON THE PAGES OF HIS BIBLE AS HE LAYS IT ON THE COTTONBALE AND WITH PATIENT FINGER THREADING HIS SLOW WAY FROM WORD TO WORD TRACES OUT ITS PROMISES HAVING LEARNED LATE IN LIFE TOM WAS BUT A SLOW READER AND PASSED ON LABORIOUSLY FROM VERSE TO VERSE FORTUNATE FOR HIM WAS IT THAT THE BOOK HE WAS INTENT ON WAS ONE WHICH SLOW READING CANNOT INJURENAY ONE WHOSE WORDS LIKE INGOTS OF GOLD SEEM OFTEN TO NEED TO BE WEIGHED SEPARATELY THAT THE MIND MAY TAKE IN THEIR PRICELESS VALUE LET US FOLLOW HIM A MOMENT AS POINTING TO EACH WORD AND PRONOUNCING EACH HALF ALOUD HE READS LETNOTYOURHEARTBETROUBLED INMYFATHERSHOUSEAREMANYMANSIONS IGOTOPREPAREAPLACEFORYOU CICERO WHEN HE BURIED HIS DARLING AND ONLY DAUGHTER HAD A HEART AS FULL OF HONEST GRIEF AS POOR TOMSPERHAPS NO FULLER FOR BOTH WERE ONLY MENBUT CICERO COULD PAUSE OVER NO SUCH SUBLIME WORDS OF HOPE AND LOOK TO NO SUCH FUTURE REUNION AND IF HE HAD SEEN THEM TEN TO ONE HE WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVEDHE MUST FILL HIS HEAD FIRST WITH A THOUSAND QUESTIONS OF AUTHENTICITY OF MANUSCRIPT AND CORRECTNESS OF TRANSLATION BUT TO POOR TOM THERE IT LAY JUST WHAT HE NEEDED SO EVIDENTLY TRUE AND DIVINE THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A QUESTION NEVER ENTERED HIS SIMPLE HEAD IT MUST BE TRUE FOR IF NOT TRUE HOW COULD HE LIVE AS FOR TOMS BIBLE THOUGH IT HAD NO ANNOTATIONS AND HELPS IN MARGIN FROM LEARNED COMMENTATORS STILL IT HAD BEEN EMBELLISHED WITH CERTAIN WAYMARKS AND GUIDEBOARDS OF TOMS OWN INVENTION AND WHICH HELPED HIM MORE THAN THE MOST LEARNED EXPOSITIONS COULD HAVE DONE IT HAD BEEN HIS CUSTOM TO GET THE BIBLE READ TO HIM BY HIS MASTERS CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR BY YOUNG MASTER GEORGE AND AS THEY READ HE WOULD DESIGNATE BY BOLD STRONG MARKS AND DASHES WITH PEN AND INK THE PASSAGES WHICH MORE PARTICULARLY GRATIFIED HIS EAR OR AFFECTED HIS HEART HIS BIBLE WAS THUS MARKED THROUGH FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER WITH A VARIETY OF STYLES AND DESIGNATIONS SO HE COULD IN A MOMENT SEIZE UPON HIS FAVORITE PASSAGES WITHOUT THE LABOR OF SPELLING OUT WHAT LAY BETWEEN THEMAND WHILE IT LAY THERE BEFORE HIM EVERY PASSAGE BREATHING OF SOME OLD HOME SCENE AND RECALLING SOME PAST ENJOYMENT HIS BIBLE SEEMED TO HIM ALL OF THIS LIFE THAT REMAINED AS WELL AS THE PROMISE OF A FUTURE ONE AMONG THE PASSENGERS ON THE BOAT WAS A YOUNG GENTLEMAN OF FORTUNE AND FAMILY RESIDENT IN NEW ORLEANS WHO BORE THE NAME OF ST CLARE HE HAD WITH HIM A DAUGHTER BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX YEARS OF AGE TOGETHER WITH A LADY WHO SEEMED TO CLAIM RELATIONSHIP TO BOTH AND TO HAVE THE LITTLE ONE ESPECIALLY UNDER HER CHARGE TOM HAD OFTEN CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF THIS LITTLE GIRLFOR SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE BUSY TRIPPING CREATURES THAT CAN BE NO MORE CONTAINED IN ONE PLACE THAN A SUNBEAM OR A SUMMER BREEZENOR WAS SHE ONE THAT ONCE SEEN COULD BE EASILY FORGOTTEN HER FORM WAS THE PERFECTION OF CHILDISH BEAUTY WITHOUT ITS USUAL CHUBBINESS AND SQUARENESS OF OUTLINE THERE WAS ABOUT IT AN UNDULATING AND AERIAL GRACE SUCH AS ONE MIGHT DREAM OF FOR SOME MYTHIC AND ALLEGORICAL BEING HER FACE WAS REMARKABLE LESS FOR ITS PERFECT BEAUTY OF FEATURE THAN FOR A SINGULAR AND DREAMY EARNESTNESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH MADE THE IDEAL START WHEN THEY LOOKED AT HER AND BY WHICH THE DULLEST AND MOST LITERAL WERE IMPRESSED WITHOUT EXACTLY KNOWING WHY THE SHAPE OF HER HEAD AND THE TURN OF HER NECK AND BUST WAS PECULIARLY NOBLE AND THE LONG GOLDENBROWN HAIR THAT FLOATED LIKE A CLOUD AROUND IT THE DEEP SPIRITUAL GRAVITY OF HER VIOLET BLUE EYES SHADED BY HEAVY FRINGES OF GOLDEN BROWNALL MARKED HER OUT FROM OTHER CHILDREN AND MADE EVERY ONE TURN AND LOOK AFTER HER AS SHE GLIDED HITHER AND THITHER ON THE BOAT NEVERTHELESS THE LITTLE ONE WAS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE CALLED EITHER A GRAVE CHILD OR A SAD ONE ON THE CONTRARY AN AIRY AND INNOCENT PLAYFULNESS SEEMED TO FLICKER LIKE THE SHADOW OF SUMMER LEAVES OVER HER CHILDISH FACE AND AROUND HER BUOYANT FIGURE SHE WAS ALWAYS IN MOTION ALWAYS WITH A HALF SMILE ON HER ROSY MOUTH FLYING HITHER AND THITHER WITH AN UNDULATING AND CLOUDLIKE TREAD SINGING TO HERSELF AS SHE MOVED AS IN A HAPPY DREAM HER FATHER AND FEMALE GUARDIAN WERE INCESSANTLY BUSY IN PURSUIT OF HERBUT WHEN CAUGHT SHE MELTED FROM THEM AGAIN LIKE A SUMMER CLOUD AND AS NO WORD OF CHIDING OR REPROOF EVER FELL ON HER EAR FOR WHATEVER SHE CHOSE TO DO SHE PURSUED HER OWN WAY ALL OVER THE BOAT ALWAYS DRESSED IN WHITE SHE SEEMED TO MOVE LIKE A SHADOW THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PLACES WITHOUT CONTRACTING SPOT OR STAIN AND THERE WAS NOT A CORNER OR NOOK ABOVE OR BELOW WHERE THOSE FAIRY FOOTSTEPS HAD NOT GLIDED AND THAT VISIONARY GOLDEN HEAD WITH ITS DEEP BLUE EYES FLEETED ALONG THE FIREMAN AS HE LOOKED UP FROM HIS SWEATY TOIL SOMETIMES FOUND THOSE EYES LOOKING WONDERINGLY INTO THE RAGING DEPTHS OF THE FURNACE AND FEARFULLY AND PITYINGLY AT HIM AS IF SHE THOUGHT HIM IN SOME DREADFUL DANGER ANON THE STEERSMAN AT THE WHEEL PAUSED AND SMILED AS THE PICTURELIKE HEAD GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE ROUND HOUSE AND IN A MOMENT WAS GONE AGAIN A THOUSAND TIMES A DAY ROUGH VOICES BLESSED HER AND SMILES OF UNWONTED SOFTNESS STOLE OVER HARD FACES AS SHE PASSED AND WHEN SHE TRIPPED FEARLESSLY OVER DANGEROUS PLACES ROUGH SOOTY HANDS WERE STRETCHED INVOLUNTARILY OUT TO SAVE HER AND SMOOTH HER PATH TOM WHO HAD THE SOFT IMPRESSIBLE NATURE OF HIS KINDLY RACE EVER YEARNING TOWARD THE SIMPLE AND CHILDLIKE WATCHED THE LITTLE CREATURE WITH DAILY INCREASING INTEREST TO HIM SHE SEEMED SOMETHING ALMOST DIVINE AND WHENEVER HER GOLDEN HEAD AND DEEP BLUE EYES PEERED OUT UPON HIM FROM BEHIND SOME DUSKY COTTONBALE OR LOOKED DOWN UPON HIM OVER SOME RIDGE OF PACKAGES HE HALF BELIEVED THAT HE SAW ONE OF THE ANGELS STEPPED OUT OF HIS NEW TESTAMENT OFTEN AND OFTEN SHE WALKED MOURNFULLY ROUND THE PLACE WHERE HALEYS GANG OF MEN AND WOMEN SAT IN THEIR CHAINS SHE WOULD GLIDE IN AMONG THEM AND LOOK AT THEM WITH AN AIR OF PERPLEXED AND SORROWFUL EARNESTNESS AND SOMETIMES SHE WOULD LIFT THEIR CHAINS WITH HER SLENDER HANDS AND THEN SIGH WOFULLY AS SHE GLIDED AWAY SEVERAL TIMES SHE APPEARED SUDDENLY AMONG THEM WITH HER HANDS FULL OF CANDY NUTS AND ORANGES WHICH SHE WOULD DISTRIBUTE JOYFULLY TO THEM AND THEN BE GONE AGAIN TOM WATCHED THE LITTLE LADY A GREAT DEAL BEFORE HE VENTURED ON ANY OVERTURES TOWARDS ACQUAINTANCESHIP HE KNEW AN ABUNDANCE OF SIMPLE ACTS TO PROPITIATE AND INVITE THE APPROACHES OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE AND HE RESOLVED TO PLAY HIS PART RIGHT SKILFULLY HE COULD CUT CUNNING LITTLE BASKETS OUT OF CHERRYSTONES COULD MAKE GROTESQUE FACES ON HICKORYNUTS OR ODDJUMPING FIGURES OUT OF ELDERPITH AND HE WAS A VERY PAN IN THE MANUFACTURE OF WHISTLES OF ALL SIZES AND SORTS HIS POCKETS WERE FULL OF MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES OF ATTRACTION WHICH HE HAD HOARDED IN DAYS OF OLD FOR HIS MASTERS CHILDREN AND WHICH HE NOW PRODUCED WITH COMMENDABLE PRUDENCE AND ECONOMY ONE BY ONE AS OVERTURES FOR ACQUAINTANCE AND FRIENDSHIP THE LITTLE ONE WAS SHY FOR ALL HER BUSY INTEREST IN EVERYTHING GOING ON AND IT WAS NOT EASY TO TAME HER FOR A WHILE SHE WOULD PERCH LIKE A CANARYBIRD ON SOME BOX OR PACKAGE NEAR TOM WHILE BUSY IN THE LITTLE ARTS AFORENAMED AND TAKE FROM HIM WITH A KIND OF GRAVE BASHFULNESS THE LITTLE ARTICLES HE OFFERED BUT AT LAST THEY GOT ON QUITE CONFIDENTIAL TERMS WHATS LITTLE MISSYS NAME SAID TOM AT LAST WHEN HE THOUGHT MATTERS WERE RIPE TO PUSH SUCH AN INQUIRY EVANGELINE ST CLARE SAID THE LITTLE ONE THOUGH PAPA AND EVERYBODY ELSE CALL

REVOLUTIONS IN THE WATER WHEN BY SOME SUDDEN MOVEMENT THE LITTLE ONE SUDDENLY LOST HER BALANCE AND FELL SHEER OVER THE SIDE OF THE BOAT INTO THE WATER HER FATHER SCARCE KNOWING WHAT HE DID WAS PLUNGING IN AFTER HER BUT WAS HELD BACK BY SOME BEHIND HIM WHO SAW THAT MORE EFFICIENT AID HAD FOLLOWED HIS CHILD TOM WAS STANDING JUST UNDER HER ON THE LOWER DECK AS SHE FELL HE SAW HER STRIKE THE WATER AND SINK AND WAS AFTER HER IN A MOMENT A BROADCHESTED STRONGARMED FELLOW IT WAS NOTHING FOR HIM TO KEEP AFLOAT IN THE WATER TILL IN A MOMENT OR TWO THE CHILD ROSE TO THE SURFACE AND HE CAUGHT HER IN HIS ARMS AND SWIMMING WITH HER TO THE BOATSIDE HANDED HER UP ALL DRIPPING TO THE GRASP OF HUNDREDS OF HANDS WHICH AS IF THEY HAD ALL BELONGED TO ONE MAN WERE STRETCHED EAGERLY OUT TO RECEIVE

THREAD OF OUR HUMBLE HEROS LIFE HAS NOW BECOME INTERWOVEN WITH THAT OF HIGHER ONES IT IS NECESSARY TO GIVE SOME BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THEM AUGUSTINE ST CLARE WAS THE SON OF A WEALTHY PLANTER OF LOUISIANA THE FAMILY HAD ITS ORIGIN IN CANADA OF TWO BROTHERS VERY SIMILAR IN TEMPERAMENT AND CHARACTER ONE HAD SETTLED ON A FLOURISHING FARM IN VERMONT AND THE OTHER BECAME AN OPULENT PLANTER IN LOUISIANA THE MOTHER OF AUGUSTINE WAS A HUGUENOT FRENCH LADY WHOSE FAMILY HAD EMIGRATED TO LOUISIANA DURING THE DAYS OF ITS EARLY SETTLEMENT AUGUSTINE AND ANOTHER BROTHER WERE THE ONLY CHILDREN OF THEIR PARENTS HAVING INHERITED FROM HIS MOTHER AN EXCEEDING DELICACY OF CONSTITUTION HE WAS AT THE INSTANCE OF PHYSICIANS DURING MANY YEARS OF HIS BOYHOOD SENT TO THE CARE OF HIS UNCLE IN VERMONT IN ORDER THAT HIS CONSTITUTION MIGHT BE STRENGTHENED BY THE COLD OF A MORE BRACING CLIMATE IN CHILDHOOD HE WAS REMARKABLE FOR AN EXTREME AND MARKED SENSITIVENESS OF CHARACTER MORE AKIN TO THE SOFTNESS OF WOMAN THAN THE ORDINARY HARDNESS OF HIS OWN SEX TIME HOWEVER OVERGREW THIS SOFTNESS WITH THE ROUGH BARK OF MANHOOD AND BUT FEW KNEW HOW LIVING AND FRESH IT STILL LAY AT THE CORE HIS TALENTS WERE OF THE VERY FIRST ORDER ALTHOUGH HIS MIND SHOWED A PREFERENCE ALWAYS FOR THE IDEAL AND THE STHETIC AND THERE WAS ABOUT HIM THAT REPUGNANCE TO THE ACTUAL BUSINESS OF LIFE WHICH IS THE COMMON RESULT OF THIS BALANCE OF THE FACULTIES SOON AFTER THE COMPLETION OF HIS COLLEGE COURSE HIS WHOLE NATURE WAS KINDLED INTO ONE INTENSE AND PASSIONATE EFFERVESCENCE OF ROMANTIC PASSION HIS HOUR CAMETHE HOUR THAT COMES ONLY ONCE HIS STAR ROSE IN THE HORIZONTHAT STAR THAT RISES SO OFTEN IN VAIN TO BE REMEMBERED ONLY AS A THING OF DREAMS AND IT ROSE FOR HIM IN VAIN TO DROP THE FIGUREHE SAW AND WON THE LOVE OF A HIGHMINDED AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN ONE OF THE NORTHERN STATES AND THEY WERE AFFIANCED HE RETURNED SOUTH TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEIR MARRIAGE WHEN MOST UNEXPECTEDLY HIS LETTERS WERE RETURNED TO HIM BY MAIL WITH A SHORT NOTE FROM HER GUARDIAN STATING TO HIM THAT ERE THIS REACHED HIM THE LADY WOULD BE THE WIFE OF ANOTHER STUNG TO MADNESS HE VAINLY HOPED AS MANY ANOTHER HAS DONE TO FLING THE WHOLE THING FROM HIS HEART BY ONE DESPERATE EFFORT TOO PROUD TO SUPPLICATE OR SEEK EXPLANATION HE THREW HIMSELF AT ONCE INTO A WHIRL OF FASHIONABLE SOCIETY AND IN A FORTNIGHT FROM THE TIME OF THE FATAL LETTER WAS THE ACCEPTED LOVER OF THE REIGNING BELLE OF THE SEASON AND AS SOON AS ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE MADE HE BECAME THE HUSBAND OF A FINE FIGURE A PAIR OF BRIGHT DARK EYES AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND OF COURSE EVERYBODY THOUGHT HIM A HAPPY FELLOW THE MARRIED COUPLE WERE ENJOYING THEIR HONEYMOON AND ENTERTAINING A BRILLIANT CIRCLE OF FRIENDS IN THEIR SPLENDID VILLA NEAR LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN WHEN ONE DAY A LETTER WAS BROUGHT TO HIM IN THAT WELLREMEMBERED WRITING IT WAS HANDED TO HIM WHILE HE WAS IN FULL TIDE OF GAY AND SUCCESSFUL CONVERSATION IN A WHOLE ROOMFULL OF COMPANY HE TURNED DEADLY PALE WHEN HE SAW THE WRITING BUT STILL PRESERVED HIS COMPOSURE AND FINISHED THE PLAYFUL WARFARE OF BADINAGE WHICH HE WAS AT THE MOMENT CARRYING ON WITH A LADY OPPOSITE AND A SHORT TIME AFTER WAS MISSED FROM THE CIRCLE IN HIS ROOM ALONE HE OPENED AND READ THE LETTER NOW WORSE THAN IDLE AND USELESS TO BE READ IT WAS FROM HER GIVING A LONG ACCOUNT OF A PERSECUTION TO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN EXPOSED BY HER GUARDIANS FAMILY TO LEAD HER TO UNITE HERSELF WITH THEIR SON AND SHE RELATED HOW FOR A LONG TIME HIS LETTERS HAD CEASED TO ARRIVE HOW SHE HAD WRITTEN TIME AND AGAIN TILL SHE BECAME WEARY AND DOUBTFUL HOW HER HEALTH HAD FAILED UNDER HER ANXIETIES AND HOW AT LAST SHE HAD DISCOVERED THE WHOLE FRAUD WHICH HAD BEEN PRACTISED ON THEM BOTH THE LETTER ENDED WITH EXPRESSIONS OF HOPE AND THANKFULNESS AND PROFESSIONS OF UNDYING AFFECTION WHICH WERE MORE BITTER THAN DEATH TO THE UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN HE WROTE TO HER IMMEDIATELY I HAVE RECEIVED YOURSBUT TOO LATE I BELIEVED ALL I HEARD I WAS DESPERATE I AM MARRIED AND ALL IS OVER ONLY FORGETIT IS ALL THAT REMAINS FOR EITHER OF US AND THUS ENDED THE WHOLE ROMANCE AND IDEAL OF LIFE FOR AUGUSTINE ST CLARE BUT THE REAL REMAINEDTHE REAL LIKE THE FLAT BARE OOZY TIDEMUD WHEN THE BLUE SPARKLING WAVE WITH ALL ITS COMPANY OF GLIDING BOATS AND WHITEWINGED SHIPS ITS MUSIC OF OARS AND CHIMING WATERS HAS GONE DOWN AND THERE IT LIES FLAT SLIMY BAREEXCEEDINGLY REAL OF COURSE IN A NOVEL PEOPLES HEARTS BREAK AND THEY DIE AND THAT IS THE END OF IT AND IN A STORY THIS IS VERY CONVENIENT BUT IN REAL LIFE WE DO NOT DIE WHEN ALL THAT MAKES LIFE BRIGHT DIES TO US THERE IS A MOST BUSY AND IMPORTANT ROUND OF EATING DRINKING DRESSING WALKING VISITING BUYING SELLING TALKING READING AND ALL THAT MAKES UP WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED LIVING YET TO BE GONE THROUGH AND THIS YET REMAINED TO AUGUSTINE HAD HIS WIFE BEEN A WHOLE WOMAN SHE MIGHT YET HAVE DONE SOMETHINGAS WOMAN CANTO MEND THE BROKEN THREADS OF LIFE AND WEAVE AGAIN INTO A TISSUE OF BRIGHTNESS BUT MARIE ST CLARE COULD NOT EVEN SEE THAT THEY HAD BEEN BROKEN AS BEFORE STATED SHE CONSISTED OF A FINE FIGURE A PAIR OF SPLENDID EYES AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NONE OF THESE ITEMS WERE PRECISELY THE ONES TO MINISTER TO A MIND DISEASED WHEN AUGUSTINE PALE AS DEATH WAS FOUND LYING ON THE SOFA AND PLEADED SUDDEN SICKHEADACHE AS THE CAUSE OF HIS DISTRESS SHE RECOMMENDED TO HIM TO SMELL OF HARTSHORN AND WHEN THE PALENESS AND HEADACHE CAME ON WEEK AFTER WEEK SHE ONLY SAID THAT SHE NEVER THOUGHT MR ST CLARE WAS SICKLY BUT IT SEEMS HE WAS VERY LIABLE TO SICKHEADACHES AND THAT IT WAS A VERY UNFORTUNATE THING FOR HER BECAUSE HE DIDNT ENJOY GOING INTO COMPANY WITH HER AND IT SEEMED ODD TO GO SO MUCH ALONE WHEN THEY WERE JUST MARRIED AUGUSTINE WAS GLAD IN HIS HEART THAT HE HAD MARRIED SO UNDISCERNING A WOMAN BUT AS THE GLOSSES AND CIVILITIES OF THE HONEYMOON WORE AWAY HE DISCOVERED THAT A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED ALL HER LIFE TO BE CARESSED AND WAITED ON MIGHT PROVE QUITE A HARD MISTRESS IN DOMESTIC LIFE MARIE NEVER HAD POSSESSED MUCH CAPABILITY OF AFFECTION OR MUCH SENSIBILITY AND THE LITTLE THAT SHE HAD HAD BEEN MERGED INTO A MOST INTENSE AND UNCONSCIOUS SELFISHNESS A SELFISHNESS THE MORE HOPELESS FROM ITS QUIET OBTUSENESS ITS UTTER IGNORANCE OF ANY CLAIMS BUT HER OWN FROM HER INFANCY SHE HAD BEEN SURROUNDED WITH SERVANTS WHO LIVED ONLY TO STUDY HER CAPRICES THE IDEA THAT THEY HAD EITHER FEELINGS OR RIGHTS HAD NEVER DAWNED UPON HER EVEN IN DISTANT PERSPECTIVE HER FATHER WHOSE ONLY CHILD SHE HAD BEEN HAD NEVER DENIED HER ANYTHING THAT LAY WITHIN THE COMPASS OF HUMAN POSSIBILITY AND WHEN SHE ENTERED LIFE BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED AND AN HEIRESS SHE HAD OF COURSE ALL THE ELIGIBLES AND NONELIGIBLES OF THE OTHER SEX SIGHING AT HER FEET AND SHE HAD NO DOUBT THAT AUGUSTINE WAS A MOST FORTUNATE MAN IN HAVING OBTAINED HER IT IS A GREAT MISTAKE TO SUPPOSE THAT A WOMAN WITH NO HEART WILL BE AN EASY CREDITOR IN THE EXCHANGE OF AFFECTION THERE IS NOT ON EARTH A MORE MERCILESS EXACTOR OF LOVE FROM OTHERS THAN A THOROUGHLY SELFISH WOMAN AND THE MORE UNLOVELY SHE GROWS THE MORE JEALOUSLY AND SCRUPULOUSLY SHE EXACTS LOVE TO THE UTTERMOST FARTHING WHEN THEREFORE ST CLARE BEGAN TO DROP OFF THOSE GALLANTRIES AND SMALL ATTENTIONS WHICH FLOWED AT FIRST THROUGH THE HABITUDE OF COURTSHIP HE FOUND HIS SULTANA NO WAY READY TO RESIGN HER SLAVE THERE WERE ABUNDANCE OF TEARS POUTINGS AND SMALL TEMPESTS THERE WERE DISCONTENTS PININGS UPBRAIDINGS ST CLARE WAS GOODNATURED AND SELFINDULGENT AND SOUGHT TO BUY OFF WITH PRESENTS AND FLATTERIES AND WHEN MARIE BECAME MOTHER TO A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER HE REALLY FELT AWAKENED FOR A TIME TO SOMETHING LIKE TENDERNESS ST CLARES MOTHER HAD BEEN A WOMAN OF UNCOMMON ELEVATION AND PURITY OF CHARACTER AND HE GAVE TO HIS CHILD HIS MOTHERS NAME FONDLY FANCYING THAT SHE WOULD PROVE A REPRODUCTION OF HER IMAGE THE THING HAD BEEN REMARKED WITH PETULANT JEALOUSY BY HIS WIFE AND SHE REGARDED HER HUSBANDS ABSORBING DEVOTION TO THE CHILD WITH SUSPICION AND DISLIKE ALL THAT WAS GIVEN TO HER SEEMED SO MUCH TAKEN FROM HERSELF FROM THE TIME OF THE BIRTH OF THIS CHILD HER HEALTH GRADUALLY SUNK A LIFE OF CONSTANT INACTION BODILY AND MENTALTHE FRICTION OF CEASELESS ENNUI AND DISCONTENT UNITED TO THE ORDINARY WEAKNESS WHICH ATTENDED THE PERIOD OF MATERNITYIN COURSE OF A FEW YEARS CHANGED THE BLOOMING YOUNG BELLE INTO A YELLOW FADED SICKLY WOMAN WHOSE TIME WAS DIVIDED AMONG A VARIETY OF FANCIFUL DISEASES AND WHO CONSIDERED HERSELF IN EVERY SENSE THE MOST ILLUSED AND SUFFERING PERSON IN EXISTENCE THERE WAS NO END OF HER VARIOUS COMPLAINTS BUT HER PRINCIPAL FORTE APPEARED TO LIE IN SICKHEADACHE WHICH SOMETIMES WOULD CONFINE HER TO HER ROOM THREE DAYS OUT OF SIX AS OF COURSE ALL FAMILY ARRANGEMENTS FELL INTO THE HANDS OF SERVANTS ST CLARE FOUND HIS MENAGE ANYTHING BUT COMFORTABLE HIS ONLY DAUGHTER WAS EXCEEDINGLY DELICATE AND HE FEARED THAT WITH NO ONE TO LOOK AFTER HER AND ATTEND TO HER HER HEALTH AND LIFE MIGHT YET FALL A SACRIFICE TO HER MOTHERS INEFFICIENCY HE HAD TAKEN HER WITH HIM ON A TOUR TO VERMONT AND HAD PERSUADED HIS COUSIN MISS OPHELIA ST CLARE TO RETURN WITH HIM TO HIS SOUTHERN RESIDENCE AND THEY ARE NOW RETURNING ON THIS BOAT WHERE WE HAVE INTRODUCED THEM TO OUR READERS AND NOW WHILE THE DISTANT DOMES AND SPIRES OF NEW ORLEANS RISE TO OUR VIEW THERE IS YET TIME FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO MISS OPHELIA WHOEVER HAS TRAVELLED IN THE NEW ENGLAND STATES WILL REMEMBER IN SOME COOL VILLAGE THE LARGE FARMHOUSE WITH ITS CLEANSWEPT GRASSY YARD SHADED BY THE DENSE AND

BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE THE ANCIENT HISTORY TEN VOLUMES BY THE FRENCH HISTORIAN CHARLES ROLLIN SCOTTS FAMILY BIBLE EDITED WITH NOTES BY THE ENGLISH BIBLICAL COMMENTATOR THOMAS SCOTT ON SUCH A FARM IN SUCH A HOUSE AND FAMILY MISS OPHELIA HAD SPENT A QUIET EXISTENCE OF SOME FORTYFIVE YEARS WHEN HER COUSIN INVITED HER TO VISIT HIS SOUTHERN MANSION THE ELDEST OF A LARGE FAMILY SHE WAS STILL CONSIDERED BY HER FATHER AND MOTHER AS ONE OF THE CHILDREN AND THE PROPOSAL THAT SHE SHOULD GO TO ORLEANS WAS A MOST MOMENTOUS ONE TO THE FAMILY CIRCLE THE OLD GRAYHEADED FATHER TOOK DOWN MORSES ATLAS OUT OF THE BOOKCASE AND LOOKED OUT THE EXACT LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AND READ FLINTS TRAVELS IN THE SOUTH AND WEST TO MAKE UP HIS OWN MIND AS TO THE NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THE CEROGRAPHIC ATLAS OF THE UNITED STATES BY SIDNEY EDWARDS MORSE SON OF THE GEOGRAPHER JEDIDIAH MORSE AND BROTHER OF THE PAINTERINVENTOR SAMUEL F B MORSE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS BY TIMOTHY FLINT MISSIONARY OF PRESBYTERIANISM TO THE TRANSALLEGHENY WEST THE GOOD MOTHER INQUIRED ANXIOUSLY IF ORLEANS WASNT AN AWFUL WICKED PLACE SAYING THAT IT SEEMED TO HER MOST EQUAL TO GOING TO THE SANDWICH ISLANDS OR ANYWHERE AMONG THE HEATHEN IT WAS KNOWN AT THE MINISTERS AND AT THE DOCTORS AND AT MISS PEABODYS MILLINER SHOP THAT OPHELIA ST CLARE WAS TALKING ABOUT GOING AWAY DOWN TO ORLEANS WITH HER COUSIN AND OF COURSE THE WHOLE VILLAGE COULD DO NO LESS THAN HELP THIS VERY IMPORTANT PROCESS OF TALKING ABOUT THE MATTER THE MINISTER WHO INCLINED STRONGLY TO ABOLITIONIST VIEWS WAS QUITE DOUBTFUL WHETHER SUCH A STEP MIGHT NOT TEND SOMEWHAT TO ENCOURAGE THE SOUTHERNERS IN HOLDING ON TO THEIR SLAVES WHILE THE DOCTOR WHO WAS A STANCH COLONIZATIONIST INCLINED TO THE OPINION THAT MISS OPHELIA OUGHT TO GO TO SHOW THE ORLEANS PEOPLE THAT WE DONT THINK HARDLY OF THEM AFTER ALL HE WAS OF OPINION IN FACT THAT SOUTHERN PEOPLE NEEDED ENCOURAGING WHEN HOWEVER THE FACT THAT SHE HAD RESOLVED TO GO WAS FULLY BEFORE THE PUBLIC MIND SHE WAS SOLEMNLY INVITED OUT TO TEA BY ALL HER FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS FOR THE SPACE OF A FORTNIGHT AND HER PROSPECTS AND PLANS DULY CANVASSED AND INQUIRED INTO MISS MOSELEY WHO CAME INTO THE HOUSE TO HELP TO DO THE DRESSMAKING ACQUIRED DAILY ACCESSIONS OF IMPORTANCE FROM THE DEVELOPMENTS WITH REGARD TO MISS OPHELIAS WARDROBE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ENABLED TO MAKE IT WAS CREDIBLY ASCERTAINED THAT SQUIRE SINCLARE AS HIS NAME WAS COMMONLY CONTRACTED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAD COUNTED OUT FIFTY DOLLARS AND GIVEN THEM TO MISS OPHELIA AND TOLD HER TO BUY ANY CLOTHES SHE THOUGHT BEST AND THAT TWO NEW SILK DRESSES AND A BONNET HAD BEEN SENT FOR FROM BOSTON AS TO THE PROPRIETY OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY OUTLAY THE PUBLIC MIND WAS DIVIDEDSOME AFFIRMING THAT IT WAS WELL ENOUGH ALL THINGS CONSIDERED FOR ONCE IN ONES LIFE AND OTHERS STOUTLY AFFIRMING THAT THE MONEY HAD BETTER HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE MISSIONARIES BUT ALL PARTIES AGREED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO SUCH PARASOL SEEN IN THOSE PARTS AS HAD BEEN SENT ON FROM NEW YORK AND THAT SHE HAD ONE SILK DRESS THAT MIGHT FAIRLY BE TRUSTED TO STAND ALONE WHATEVER MIGHT BE SAID OF ITS MISTRESS THERE WERE CREDIBLE RUMORS ALSO OF A HEMSTITCHED POCKETHANDKERCHIEF AND REPORT EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO STATE THAT MISS OPHELIA HAD ONE POCKETHANDKERCHIEF WITH LACE ALL AROUND ITIT WAS EVEN ADDED THAT IT WAS WORKED IN THE CORNERS BUT THIS LATTER POINT WAS NEVER SATISFACTORILY ASCERTAINED AND REMAINS IN FACT UNSETTLED TO THIS DAY MISS OPHELIA AS YOU NOW BEHOLD HER STANDS BEFORE YOU IN A VERY SHINING BROWN LINEN TRAVELLINGDRESS TALL SQUAREFORMED AND ANGULAR HER FACE WAS THIN AND RATHER SHARP IN ITS OUTLINES THE LIPS COMPRESSED LIKE THOSE OF A PERSON WHO IS IN THE HABIT OF MAKING UP HER MIND DEFINITELY ON ALL SUBJECTS WHILE THE KEEN DARK EYES HAD A PECULIARLY SEARCHING ADVISED MOVEMENT AND TRAVELLED OVER EVERYTHING AS IF THEY WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO TAKE CARE OF ALL HER MOVEMENTS WERE SHARP DECIDED AND ENERGETIC AND THOUGH SHE WAS NEVER MUCH OF A TALKER HER WORDS WERE REMARKABLY DIRECT AND TO THE PURPOSE WHEN SHE DID SPEAK IN HER HABITS SHE WAS A LIVING IMPERSONATION OF ORDER METHOD AND EXACTNESS IN PUNCTUALITY SHE WAS AS INEVITABLE AS A CLOCK AND AS INEXORABLE AS A RAILROAD ENGINE AND SHE HELD IN MOST DECIDED CONTEMPT AND ABOMINATION ANYTHING OF A CONTRARY CHARACTER THE GREAT SIN OF SINS IN HER EYESTHE SUM OF ALL EVILSWAS EXPRESSED BY ONE VERY COMMON AND IMPORTANT WORD IN HER VOCABULARYSHIFTLESSNESS HER FINALE AND ULTIMATUM OF CONTEMPT CONSISTED IN A VERY EMPHATIC PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SHIFTLESS AND BY THIS SHE CHARACTERIZED ALL MODES OF PROCEDURE WHICH HAD NOT A DIRECT AND INEVITABLE RELATION TO ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SOME PURPOSE THEN DEFINITELY HAD IN MIND PEOPLE WHO DID NOTHING OR WHO DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO OR WHO DID NOT TAKE THE MOST DIRECT WAY TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY SET THEIR HANDS TO WERE OBJECTS OF HER ENTIRE CONTEMPTA CONTEMPT SHOWN LESS FREQUENTLY BY ANYTHING SHE SAID THAN BY A KIND OF STONY GRIMNESS AS IF SHE SCORNED TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER AS TO MENTAL CULTIVATIONSHE HAD A CLEAR STRONG ACTIVE MIND WAS WELL AND THOROUGHLY READ IN HISTORY AND THE OLDER ENGLISH CLASSICS AND THOUGHT WITH GREAT STRENGTH WITHIN CERTAIN NARROW LIMITS HER THEOLOGICAL TENETS WERE ALL MADE UP LABELLED IN MOST POSITIVE AND DISTINCT FORMS AND PUT BY LIKE THE BUNDLES IN HER PATCH TRUNK THERE WERE JUST SO MANY OF THEM AND THERE WERE NEVER TO BE ANY MORE SO ALSO WERE HER IDEAS WITH REGARD TO MOST MATTERS OF PRACTICAL LIFESUCH AS HOUSEKEEPING IN ALL ITS BRANCHES AND THE VARIOUS POLITICAL RELATIONS OF HER NATIVE VILLAGE AND UNDERLYING ALL DEEPER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HIGHER AND BROADER LAY THE STRONGEST PRINCIPLE OF HER BEINGCONSCIENTIOUSNESS NOWHERE IS CONSCIENCE SO DOMINANT AND ALLABSORBING AS WITH NEW ENGLAND WOMEN IT IS THE GRANITE FORMATION WHICH LIES DEEPEST AND RISES OUT EVEN TO THE TOPS OF THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS MISS OPHELIA WAS THE ABSOLUTE BONDSLAVE OF THE OUGHT ONCE MAKE HER CERTAIN THAT THE PATH OF DUTY AS SHE COMMONLY PHRASED IT LAY IN ANY GIVEN DIRECTION AND FIRE AND WATER COULD NOT KEEP HER FROM IT SHE WOULD WALK STRAIGHT DOWN INTO A WELL OR UP TO A LOADED CANNONS MOUTH IF SHE WERE ONLY QUITE SURE THAT THERE THE PATH LAY HER STANDARD OF RIGHT WAS SO HIGH SO ALLEMBRACING SO MINUTE AND MAKING SO FEW CONCESSIONS TO HUMAN FRAILTY THAT THOUGH SHE STROVE WITH HEROIC ARDOR TO REACH IT SHE NEVER ACTUALLY DID SO AND OF COURSE WAS BURDENED WITH A CONSTANT AND OFTEN HARASSING SENSE OF DEFICIENCYTHIS GAVE A SEVERE AND SOMEWHAT GLOOMY CAST TO HER RELIGIOUS CHARACTER BUT HOW IN THE WORLD CAN MISS OPHELIA GET ALONG WITH AUGUSTINE ST CLAREGAY EASY UNPUNCTUAL UNPRACTICAL SCEPTICALIN SHORTWALKING WITH IMPUDENT AND NONCHALANT FREEDOM OVER EVERY ONE OF HER MOST CHERISHED HABITS AND OPINIONS TO TELL THE TRUTH THEN MISS OPHELIA LOVED HIM WHEN A BOY IT HAD BEEN HERS TO TEACH HIM HIS CATECHISM MEND HIS CLOTHES COMB HIS HAIR AND BRING HIM UP GENERALLY IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO AND HER HEART HAVING A WARM SIDE TO IT AUGUSTINE HAD AS HE USUALLY DID WITH MOST PEOPLE MONOPOLIZED A LARGE SHARE OF IT FOR HIMSELF AND THEREFORE IT WAS THAT HE SUCCEEDED VERY EASILY IN PERSUADING HER THAT THE PATH OF DUTY LAY IN THE DIRECTION OF NEW ORLEANS AND THAT SHE MUST GO WITH HIM TO TAKE CARE OF EVA AND KEEP EVERYTHING FROM GOING TO WRECK AND RUIN DURING THE FREQUENT ILLNESSES OF HIS WIFE THE IDEA OF A HOUSE WITHOUT ANYBODY TO TAKE CARE OF IT WENT TO HER HEART THEN SHE LOVED THE LOVELY LITTLE GIRL AS FEW COULD HELP DOING AND THOUGH SHE REGARDED AUGUSTINE AS VERY MUCH OF A HEATHEN YET SHE LOVED HIM LAUGHED AT HIS JOKES AND FORBORE WITH HIS FAILINGS TO AN EXTENT WHICH THOSE WHO KNEW HIM THOUGHT PERFECTLY INCREDIBLE BUT WHAT MORE OR OTHER IS TO BE KNOWN OF MISS OPHELIA OUR READER MUST DISCOVER BY A PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCE THERE SHE IS SITTING NOW IN HER STATEROOM SURROUNDED BY A MIXED MULTITUDE OF LITTLE AND BIG CARPETBAGS BOXES BASKETS EACH CONTAINING

WAS PECULIAR TO HER SHE WALKED SOFTLY ROUND TO HER MOTHERS CHAIR AND PUT HER ARMS ROUND HER NECK WELL EVA WHAT NOW SAID MARIE MAMMA COULDNT I TAKE CARE OF YOU ONE NIGHTJUST ONE I KNOW I SHOULDNT MAKE YOU NERVOUS AND I SHOULDNT SLEEP I OFTEN LIE AWAKE NIGHTS THINKING O NONSENSE CHILDNONSENSE SAID MARIE YOU ARE SUCH A STRANGE CHILD BUT MAY I MAMMA I THINK SHE SAID TIMIDLY THAT MAMMY ISNT WELL SHE TOLD ME HER HEAD ACHED ALL THE TIME LATELY O THATS JUST ONE OF MAMMYS FIDGETS MAMMY IS JUST LIKE ALL THE REST OF THEMMAKES SUCH A FUSS ABOUT EVERY LITTLE HEADACHE OR FINGERACHE ITLL NEVER DO TO ENCOURAGE ITNEVER IM PRINCIPLED ABOUT THIS MATTER SAID SHE TURNING TO MISS OPHELIA YOULL FIND THE NECESSITY OF IT IF YOU ENCOURAGE SERVANTS IN GIVING WAY TO EVERY LITTLE DISAGREEABLE FEELING AND COMPLAINING OF EVERY LITTLE AILMENT YOULL HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL I NEVER COMPLAIN MYSELFNOBODY KNOWS WHAT I ENDURE I FEEL IT A DUTY TO BEAR IT QUIETLY AND I DO MISS OPHELIAS ROUND EYES EXPRESSED AN UNDISGUISED AMAZEMENT AT THIS PERORATION WHICH STRUCK ST CLARE AS SO SUPREMELY LUDICROUS THAT HE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH ST CLARE ALWAYS LAUGHS WHEN I MAKE THE LEAST ALLUSION TO MY ILL HEALTH SAID MARIE WITH THE VOICE OF A SUFFERING MARTYR I ONLY HOPE THE DAY WONT COME WHEN HELL REMEMBER IT AND MARIE PUT HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER EYES OF COURSE THERE WAS RATHER A FOOLISH SILENCE FINALLY ST CLARE GOT UP LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND SAID HE HAD AN ENGAGEMENT DOWN STREET EVA TRIPPED AWAY AFTER HIM AND MISS OPHELIA AND MARIE REMAINED AT THE TABLE ALONE NOW THATS JUST LIKE ST CLARE SAID THE LATTER WITHDRAWING HER HANDKERCHIEF WITH SOMEWHAT OF A SPIRITED FLOURISH WHEN THE CRIMINAL TO BE AFFECTED BY IT WAS NO LONGER IN SIGHT HE NEVER REALIZES NEVER CAN NEVER WILL WHAT I SUFFER AND HAVE FOR YEARS IF I WAS ONE OF THE COMPLAINING SORT OR EVER MADE ANY FUSS ABOUT MY AILMENTS THERE WOULD BE SOME REASON FOR IT MEN DO GET TIRED NATURALLY OF A COMPLAINING WIFE BUT IVE KEPT THINGS TO MYSELF AND BORNE AND BORNE TILL ST CLARE HAS GOT IN THE WAY OF THINKING I CAN BEAR ANYTHING MISS OPHELIA DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW WHAT SHE WAS EXPECTED TO ANSWER TO THIS WHILE SHE WAS THINKING WHAT TO SAY MARIE GRADUALLY WIPED AWAY HER TEARS AND SMOOTHED HER PLUMAGE IN A GENERAL SORT OF WAY AS A DOVE MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO MAKE TOILET AFTER A SHOWER AND BEGAN A HOUSEWIFELY CHAT WITH MISS OPHELIA CONCERNING CUPBOARDS CLOSETS LINENPRESSES STOREROOMS AND OTHER MATTERS OF WHICH THE LATTER WAS BY COMMON UNDERSTANDING TO ASSUME THE DIRECTIONGIVING HER SO MANY CAUTIOUS DIRECTIONS AND CHARGES THAT A HEAD LESS SYSTEMATIC AND BUSINESSLIKE THAN MISS OPHELIAS WOULD HAVE BEEN UTTERLY DIZZIED AND CONFOUNDED AND NOW SAID MARIE I BELIEVE IVE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING SO THAT WHEN MY NEXT SICK TURN COMES ON YOULL BE ABLE TO GO FORWARD ENTIRELY WITHOUT CONSULTING MEONLY ABOUT EVASHE REQUIRES WATCHING SHE SEEMS TO BE A GOOD CHILD VERY SAID MISS OPHELIA I NEVER SAW A BETTER CHILD EVAS PECULIAR SAID HER MOTHER VERY THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT HER SO SINGULAR SHE ISNT LIKE ME NOW A PARTICLE AND MARIE SIGHED AS IF THIS WAS A TRULY MELANCHOLY CONSIDERATION MISS OPHELIA IN HER OWN HEART SAID I HOPE SHE ISNT BUT HAD PRUDENCE ENOUGH TO KEEP IT DOWN EVA ALWAYS WAS DISPOSED TO BE WITH SERVANTS AND I THINK THAT WELL ENOUGH WITH SOME CHILDREN NOW I ALWAYS PLAYED WITH FATHERS LITTLE NEGROESIT NEVER DID ME ANY HARM BUT EVA SOMEHOW ALWAYS SEEMS TO PUT HERSELF ON AN EQUALITY WITH EVERY CREATURE THAT COMES NEAR HER ITS A STRANGE THING ABOUT THE CHILD I NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BREAK HER OF IT ST CLARE I BELIEVE ENCOURAGES HER IN IT THE FACT IS ST CLARE INDULGES EVERY CREATURE UNDER THIS ROOF BUT HIS OWN WIFE AGAIN MISS OPHELIA SAT IN BLANK SILENCE NOW THERES NO WAY WITH SERVANTS SAID MARIE BUT TO PUT THEM DOWN AND KEEP THEM DOWN IT WAS ALWAYS NATURAL TO ME FROM A CHILD EVA IS ENOUGH TO SPOIL A WHOLE HOUSEFULL WHAT SHE WILL DO WHEN SHE COMES TO KEEP HOUSE HERSELF IM SURE I DONT KNOW I HOLD TO BEING KIND TO SERVANTSI ALWAYS AM BUT YOU MUST MAKE EM KNOW THEIR PLACE EVA NEVER DOES THERES NO GETTING INTO THE CHILDS HEAD THE FIRST BEGINNING OF AN IDEA WHAT A SERVANTS PLACE IS YOU HEARD HER OFFERING TO TAKE CARE OF ME NIGHTS TO LET MAMMY SLEEP THATS JUST A SPECIMEN OF THE WAY THE CHILD WOULD BE DOING ALL THE TIME IF SHE WAS LEFT TO HERSELF WHY SAID MISS OPHELIA BLUNTLY I SUPPOSE YOU THINK YOUR SERVANTS ARE HUMAN CREATURES AND OUGHT TO HAVE SOME REST WHEN THEY ARE TIRED CERTAINLY OF COURSE IM VERY PARTICULAR IN LETTING THEM HAVE EVERYTHING THAT COMES CONVENIENTANYTHING THAT DOESNT PUT ONE AT ALL OUT OF THE WAY YOU KNOW MAMMY CAN MAKE UP HER SLEEP SOME TIME OR OTHER THERES NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT SHES THE SLEEPIEST CONCERN THAT EVER I SAW SEWING STANDING OR SITTING THAT CREATURE WILL GO TO SLEEP AND SLEEP ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE NO DANGER BUT MAMMY GETS SLEEP ENOUGH BUT THIS TREATING SERVANTS AS IF THEY WERE EXOTIC FLOWERS OR CHINA VASES IS REALLY RIDICULOUS SAID MARIE AS SHE PLUNGED LANGUIDLY INTO THE DEPTHS OF A VOLUMINOUS AND PILLOWY LOUNGE AND DREW TOWARDS HER AN ELEGANT CUTGLASS VINAIGRETTE YOU SEE SHE CONTINUED IN A FAINT AND LADYLIKE VOICE LIKE THE LAST DYING BREATH OF AN ARABIAN JESSAMINE OR SOMETHING EQUALLY ETHEREAL YOU SEE COUSIN OPHELIA I DONT OFTEN SPEAK OF MYSELF IT ISNT MY HABIT T ISNT AGREEABLE TO ME IN FACT I HAVENT STRENGTH TO DO IT BUT THERE ARE POINTS WHERE ST CLARE AND I DIFFER ST CLARE NEVER UNDERSTOOD ME NEVER APPRECIATED ME I THINK IT LIES AT THE ROOT OF ALL MY ILL HEALTH ST CLARE MEANS WELL I AM BOUND TO BELIEVE BUT MEN ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY SELFISH AND INCONSIDERATE TO WOMAN THAT AT LEAST IS MY IMPRESSION MISS OPHELIA WHO HAD NOT A SMALL SHARE OF THE GENUINE NEW ENGLAND CAUTION AND A VERY PARTICULAR HORROR OF BEING DRAWN INTO FAMILY DIFFICULTIES NOW BEGAN TO FORESEE SOMETHING OF THIS KIND IMPENDING SO COMPOSING HER FACE INTO A GRIM NEUTRALITY AND DRAWING OUT OF HER POCKET ABOUT A YARD AND A QUARTER OF STOCKING WHICH SHE KEPT AS A SPECIFIC AGAINST WHAT DR WATTS ASSERTS TO BE A PERSONAL HABIT OF SATAN WHEN PEOPLE HAVE IDLE HANDS SHE PROCEEDED TO KNIT MOST ENERGETICALLY SHUTTING HER LIPS TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT SAID AS PLAIN AS WORDS COULD YOU NEEDNT TRY TO MAKE ME SPEAK I DONT WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR AFFAIRSIN FACT SHE LOOKED ABOUT AS SYMPATHIZING AS A STONE LION BUT MARIE DIDNT CARE FOR THAT SHE HAD GOT SOMEBODY TO TALK TO AND SHE FELT IT HER DUTY TO TALK AND THAT WAS ENOUGH AND REINFORCING HERSELF BY SMELLING AGAIN AT HER VINAIGRETTE SHE WENT ON YOU SEE I BROUGHT MY OWN PROPERTY AND SERVANTS INTO THE CONNECTION WHEN I MARRIED ST CLARE AND I AM LEGALLY ENTITLED TO MANAGE THEM MY OWN WAY ST CLARE HAD HIS FORTUNE AND HIS SERVANTS AND IM WELL ENOUGH CONTENT HE SHOULD MANAGE THEM HIS WAY BUT ST CLARE WILL BE INTERFERING HE HAS WILD EXTRAVAGANT NOTIONS ABOUT THINGS PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF SERVANTS HE REALLY DOES ACT AS IF HE SET HIS SERVANTS BEFORE ME AND BEFORE HIMSELF TOO FOR HE LETS THEM MAKE HIM ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE AND NEVER LIFTS A FINGER NOW ABOUT SOME THINGS ST CLARE IS REALLY FRIGHTFULHE FRIGHTENS MEGOODNATURED AS HE LOOKS IN GENERAL NOW HE HAS SET DOWN HIS FOOT THAT COME WHAT WILL THERE SHALL NOT BE A BLOW STRUCK IN THIS HOUSE EXCEPT WHAT HE OR I STRIKE AND HE DOES IT IN A WAY THAT I REALLY DARE NOT CROSS HIM WELL YOU MAY SEE WHAT THAT LEADS TO FOR ST CLARE WOULDNT RAISE HIS HAND IF EVERY ONE OF THEM WALKED OVER HIM AND IYOU SEE HOW CRUEL IT WOULD BE TO REQUIRE ME TO MAKE THE EXERTION NOW YOU KNOW THESE SERVANTS ARE NOTHING BUT GROWNUP CHILDREN I DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND I THANK THE LORD THAT I DONT SAID MISS OPHELIA SHORTLY WELL BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING AND KNOW IT TO YOUR COST IF YOU STAY HERE YOU DONT KNOW WHAT A PROVOKING STUPID CARELESS UNREASONABLE CHILDISH UNGRATEFUL SET OF WRETCHES THEY ARE MARIE SEEMED WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED ALWAYS WHEN SHE GOT UPON THIS TOPIC AND SHE NOW OPENED HER EYES AND SEEMED QUITE TO FORGET HER LANGUOR YOU DONT KNOW AND YOU CANT THE DAILY HOURLY TRIALS THAT BESET A HOUSEKEEPER FROM THEM EVERYWHERE AND EVERY WAY BUT ITS NO USE TO COMPLAIN TO ST CLARE HE TALKS THE STRANGEST STUFF HE SAYS WE HAVE MADE THEM WHAT THEY ARE AND OUGHT TO BEAR WITH THEM HE SAYS THEIR FAULTS ARE ALL OWING TO US AND THAT IT WOULD BE CRUEL TO MAKE THE FAULT AND PUNISH IT TOO HE SAYS WE SHOULDNT DO ANY BETTER IN THEIR PLACE JUST AS IF ONE COULD REASON FROM THEM TO US YOU KNOW DONT YOU BELIEVE THAT THE LORD MADE THEM OF ONE BLOOD WITH US SAID MISS OPHELIA SHORTLY NO INDEED NOT I A PRETTY STORY TRULY THEY ARE A DEGRADED RACE DONT YOU THINK THEYVE GOT IMMORTAL SOULS SAID MISS OPHELIA WITH INCREASING INDIGNATION O WELL SAID MARIE YAWNING THAT OF COURSENOBODY DOUBTS THAT BUT AS TO PUTTING THEM ON ANY SORT OF EQUALITY WITH US YOU KNOW AS IF WE COULD BE COMPARED WHY ITS IMPOSSIBLE NOW ST CLARE REALLY HAS TALKED TO ME AS IF KEEPING MAMMY FROM HER HUSBAND WAS LIKE KEEPING ME FROM MINE THERES NO COMPARING IN THIS WAY MAMMY COULDNT HAVE THE FEELINGS THAT I SHOULD ITS A DIFFERENT THING ALTOGETHEROF COURSE IT ISAND YET ST CLARE PRETENDS NOT TO SEE IT AND JUST AS IF MAMMY COULD LOVE HER LITTLE DIRTY BABIES AS I LOVE EVA YET ST CLARE ONCE REALLY AND SOBERLY TRIED TO PERSUADE ME THAT IT WAS MY DUTY WITH MY WEAK HEALTH AND ALL I SUFFER TO LET MAMMY GO BACK AND TAKE SOMEBODY ELSE IN HER PLACE THAT WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH EVEN FOR ME TO BEAR I DONT OFTEN SHOW MY FEELINGS I MAKE IT A PRINCIPLE TO ENDURE EVERYTHING IN SILENCE ITS A WIFES HARD LOT AND I BEAR IT BUT I DID BREAK OUT THAT TIME SO THAT HE HAS NEVER ALLUDED TO THE SUBJECT SINCE BUT I KNOW BY HIS LOOKS AND LITTLE THINGS THAT HE SAYS THAT HE THINKS SO AS MUCH AS EVER AND ITS SO TRYING SO PROVOKING MISS OPHELIA LOOKED VERY MUCH AS IF SHE WAS AFRAID SHE SHOULD SAY SOMETHING BUT SHE RATTLED AWAY WITH HER NEEDLES IN A WAY THAT HAD VOLUMES OF MEANING IN IT IF MARIE COULD ONLY HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT SO YOU JUST SEE SHE CONTINUED WHAT YOUVE GOT TO MANAGE A HOUSEHOLD WITHOUT ANY RULE WHERE SERVANTS HAVE IT ALL THEIR OWN WAY DO WHAT THEY PLEASE AND HAVE WHAT THEY PLEASE EXCEPT SO FAR AS I WITH MY FEEBLE HEALTH HAVE KEPT UP GOVERNMENT I KEEP MY COWHIDE ABOUT AND SOMETIMES I DO LAY IT ON BUT THE EXERTION IS ALWAYS TOO MUCH FOR ME IF ST CLARE WOULD ONLY HAVE THIS THING DONE AS OTHERS DO AND HOWS THAT WHY SEND THEM TO THE CALABOOSE OR SOME OF THE OTHER PLACES TO BE FLOGGED THATS THE ONLY WAY IF I WASNT SUCH A POOR FEEBLE PIECE I BELIEVE I SHOULD MANAGE WITH TWICE THE ENERGY THAT ST CLARE DOES AND HOW DOES ST CLARE CONTRIVE TO MANAGE SAID MISS OPHELIA YOU SAY HE NEVER STRIKES A BLOW WELL MEN HAVE A MORE COMMANDING WAY YOU KNOW IT IS EASIER FOR THEM BESIDES IF YOU EVER LOOKED FULL IN HIS EYE ITS PECULIARTHAT EYEAND IF HE SPEAKS DECIDEDLY THERES A KIND OF FLASH IM AFRAID OF IT MYSELF AND THE SERVANTS KNOW THEY MUST MIND I COULDNT DO AS MUCH BY A REGULAR STORM AND SCOLDING AS ST CLARE CAN BY ONE TURN OF HIS EYE IF ONCE HE IS IN EARNEST O THERES NO TROUBLE ABOUT ST CLARE THATS THE REASON HES NO MORE FEELING FOR ME BUT YOULL FIND WHEN YOU COME TO MANAGE THAT THERES NO GETTING ALONG WITHOUT SEVERITYTHEY ARE SO BAD SO DECEITFUL SO LAZY THE OLD TUNE SAID ST CLARE SAUNTERING IN WHAT AN AWFUL ACCOUNT THESE WICKED CREATURES WILL HAVE TO SETTLE AT LAST ESPECIALLY FOR BEING LAZY YOU SEE COUSIN SAID HE AS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF AT FULL LENGTH ON A LOUNGE OPPOSITE TO MARIE ITS WHOLLY INEXCUSABLE IN THEM IN THE LIGHT OF THE EXAMPLE THAT MARIE AND I SET THEMTHIS LAZINESS COME NOW ST CLARE YOU ARE TOO BAD SAID MARIE AM I NOW WHY I THOUGHT I WAS TALKING GOOD QUITE

HIM A WHILE ID BRING HIM DOWN WHAT YOU SAY MY DEAR IS MARKED WITH YOUR USUAL ACUTENESS AND GOOD SENSE SAID ST CLARE AS TO DOLPH THE CASE IS THIS THAT HE HAS SO LONG BEEN ENGAGED IN IMITATING MY GRACES AND PERFECTIONS THAT HE HAS AT LAST REALLY MISTAKEN HIMSELF FOR HIS MASTER AND I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE INSIGHT INTO HIS MISTAKE HOW SAID MARIE WHY I WAS OBLIGED TO LET HIM UNDERSTAND EXPLICITLY THAT I PREFERRED TO KEEP SOME OF MY CLOTHES FOR MY OWN PERSONAL WEARING ALSO I PUT HIS MAGNIFICENCE UPON AN ALLOWANCE OF COLOGNEWATER AND ACTUALLY WAS SO CRUEL AS TO RESTRICT HIM TO ONE DOZEN OF MY CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEFS DOLPH WAS PARTICULARLY HUFFY ABOUT IT AND I HAD TO TALK TO HIM LIKE A FATHER TO BRING HIM ROUND O ST CLARE WHEN WILL YOU LEARN HOW TO TREAT YOUR SERVANTS ITS ABOMINABLE THE WAY YOU INDULGE THEM SAID MARIE WHY AFTER ALL WHATS THE HARM OF THE POOR DOGS WANTING TO BE LIKE HIS MASTER AND IF I HAVENT BROUGHT HIM UP ANY BETTER THAN TO FIND HIS CHIEF GOOD IN COLOGNE AND CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEFS WHY SHOULDNT I GIVE THEM TO HIM AND WHY HAVENT YOU BROUGHT HIM UP BETTER SAID MISS OPHELIA WITH BLUNT DETERMINATION TOO MUCH TROUBLELAZINESS COUSIN LAZINESSWHICH RUINS MORE SOULS THAN YOU CAN SHAKE A STICK AT IF IT WERENT FOR LAZINESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PERFECT ANGEL MYSELF IM INCLINED TO THINK THAT LAZINESS IS WHAT YOUR OLD DR BOTHEREM UP IN VERMONT USED TO CALL THE ESSENCE OF MORAL EVIL ITS AN AWFUL CONSIDERATION CERTAINLY I THINK YOU SLAVEHOLDERS HAVE AN AWFUL RESPONSIBILITY UPON YOU SAID MISS OPHELIA I WOULDNT HAVE IT FOR A THOUSAND WORLDS YOU OUGHT TO EDUCATE YOUR SLAVES AND TREAT THEM LIKE REASONABLE CREATURESLIKE IMMORTAL CREATURES THAT YOUVE GOT TO STAND BEFORE THE BAR OF GOD WITH THATS MY MIND SAID THE GOOD LADY BREAKING SUDDENLY OUT WITH A

FEELING OF PERSONAL PREJUDICE I HAVE OFTEN NOTICED IN MY TRAVELS NORTH HOW MUCH STRONGER THIS WAS WITH YOU THAN WITH US YOU LOATHE THEM AS YOU WOULD A SNAKE OR A TOAD YET YOU ARE INDIGNANT AT THEIR WRONGS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THEM ABUSED BUT YOU DONT WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM YOURSELVES YOU WOULD SEND THEM TO AFRICA OUT OF YOUR SIGHT AND SMELL AND THEN SEND A MISSIONARY OR TWO TO DO UP ALL THE SELFDENIAL OF ELEVATING THEM COMPENDIOUSLY ISNT THAT IT WELL COUSIN SAID MISS OPHELIA THOUGHTFULLY THERE MAY BE SOME TRUTH IN THIS WHAT WOULD THE POOR AND LOWLY DO WITHOUT CHILDREN SAID ST CLARE LEANING ON THE RAILING AND WATCHING EVA AS SHE TRIPPED OFF LEADING TOM WITH HER YOUR LITTLE CHILD IS YOUR ONLY TRUE DEMOCRAT TOM NOW IS A HERO TO EVA HIS STORIES ARE WONDERS IN HER EYES HIS SONGS AND METHODIST HYMNS ARE BETTER THAN AN OPERA AND THE TRAPS AND LITTLE BITS OF TRASH IN HIS POCKET A MINE OF JEWELS AND HE THE MOST WONDERFUL TOM THAT EVER WORE A BLACK SKIN THIS IS ONE OF THE ROSES OF EDEN THAT THE LORD HAS DROPPED DOWN EXPRESSLY FOR THE POOR AND LOWLY WHO GET FEW ENOUGH OF ANY OTHER KIND ITS STRANGE COUSIN SAID MISS OPHELIA ONE MIGHT ALMOST THINK YOU WERE A PROFESSOR TO HEAR YOU TALK A PROFESSOR SAID ST CLARE YES A PROFESSOR OF RELIGION NOT AT ALL NOT A PROFESSOR AS YOUR TOWNFOLKS HAVE IT AND WHAT IS WORSE IM AFRAID NOT A PRACTISER EITHER WHAT MAKES YOU TALK SO THEN NOTHING IS EASIER THAN TALKING SAID ST CLARE I BELIEVE SHAKESPEARE MAKES SOMEBODY SAY I COULD SOONER SHOW TWENTY WHAT WERE GOOD TO BE DONE THAN BE ONE OF THE TWENTY TO FOLLOW MY OWN SHOWING NOTHING

COMPLAIN OF LITTLE EVAS FANCY FOR HIMTHE INSTINCTIVE GRATITUDE AND LOVELINESS OF A NOBLE NATUREHAD LED HER TO PETITION HER FATHER THAT HE MIGHT BE HER ESPECIAL ATTENDANT WHENEVER SHE NEEDED THE ESCORT OF A SERVANT IN HER WALKS OR RIDES AND TOM HAD GENERAL ORDERS TO LET EVERYTHING ELSE GO AND ATTEND TO MISS EVA WHENEVER SHE WANTED HIMORDERS WHICH OUR READERS MAY FANCY WERE FAR FROM DISAGREEABLE TO HIM HE WAS KEPT WELL DRESSED FOR ST CLARE WAS FASTIDIOUSLY PARTICULAR ON THIS POINT HIS STABLE SERVICES WERE MERELY A SINECURE AND CONSISTED SIMPLY IN A DAILY CARE AND INSPECTION AND DIRECTING AN UNDERSERVANT IN HIS DUTIES FOR MARIE ST CLARE DECLARED THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE ANY SMELL OF THE HORSES ABOUT HIM WHEN HE CAME NEAR HER AND THAT HE MUST POSITIVELY NOT BE PUT TO ANY SERVICE THAT WOULD MAKE HIM UNPLEASANT TO HER AS HER NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS ENTIRELY INADEQUATE TO ANY TRIAL OF THAT NATURE ONE SNUFF OF ANYTHING DISAGREEABLE BEING ACCORDING TO HER ACCOUNT QUITE SUFFICIENT TO CLOSE THE SCENE AND PUT AN END TO ALL HER EARTHLY TRIALS AT ONCE TOM THEREFORE IN HIS WELLBRUSHED BROADCLOTH SUIT SMOOTH BEAVER GLOSSY BOOTS FAULTLESS WRISTBANDS AND COLLAR WITH HIS GRAVE GOODNATURED BLACK FACE LOOKED RESPECTABLE ENOUGH TO BE A BISHOP OF CARTHAGE AS MEN OF HIS COLOR WERE IN OTHER AGES THEN TOO HE WAS IN A BEAUTIFUL PLACE A CONSIDERATION TO WHICH HIS SENSITIVE RACE WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT AND HE DID ENJOY WITH A QUIET JOY THE BIRDS THE FLOWERS THE FOUNTAINS THE PERFUME AND LIGHT AND BEAUTY OF THE COURT THE SILKEN HANGINGS AND PICTURES AND LUSTRES AND STATUETTES AND GILDING THAT MADE THE PARLORS WITHIN A KIND OF ALADDINS PALACE TO HIM IF EVER AFRICA SHALL SHOW AN ELEVATED AND CULTIVATED RACEAND COME IT MUST SOME TIME HER TURN TO FIGURE IN THE GREAT DRAMA OF HUMAN IMPROVEMENTLIFE WILL

REVELATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE CERTAINLY THEY WILL IN THEIR GENTLENESS THEIR LOWLY DOCILITY OF HEART THEIR APTITUDE TO REPOSE ON A SUPERIOR MIND AND REST ON A HIGHER POWER THEIR CHILDLIKE SIMPLICITY OF AFFECTION AND FACILITY OF FORGIVENESS IN ALL THESE THEY WILL EXHIBIT THE HIGHEST FORM OF THE PECULIARLY CHRISTIAN LIFE AND PERHAPS AS GOD CHASTENETH WHOM HE LOVETH HE HATH CHOSEN POOR AFRICA IN THE FURNACE OF AFFLICTION TO MAKE HER THE HIGHEST AND NOBLEST IN THAT KINGDOM WHICH HE WILL SET UP WHEN EVERY OTHER KINGDOM HAS BEEN TRIED AND FAILED FOR THE FIRST SHALL BE LAST AND THE LAST FIRST WAS THIS WHAT MARIE ST CLARE WAS THINKING OF AS SHE STOOD GORGEOUSLY DRESSED ON THE VERANDAH ON SUNDAY MORNING CLASPING A DIAMOND BRACELET ON HER SLENDER WRIST MOST LIKELY IT WAS OR IF IT WASNT THAT IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE FOR MARIE PATRONIZED GOOD THINGS AND SHE WAS GOING NOW IN FULL FORCEDIAMONDS SILK AND LACE AND JEWELS AND ALLTO A FASHIONABLE CHURCH TO BE VERY RELIGIOUS MARIE ALWAYS MADE A POINT

CLARE STOOD ON THE STEPS AND KISSED HIS HAND TO HER AS THE CARRIAGE DROVE AWAY LARGE TEARS WERE IN HIS EYES O EVANGELINE RIGHTLY NAMED HE SAID HATH NOT GOD MADE THEE AN EVANGEL TO ME SO HE FELT A MOMENT AND THEN HE SMOKED A CIGAR AND READ THE PICAYUNE AND FORGOT HIS LITTLE GOSPEL WAS HE MUCH UNLIKE OTHER FOLKS YOU SEE EVANGELINE SAID HER MOTHER ITS ALWAYS RIGHT AND PROPER TO BE KIND TO SERVANTS BUT IT ISNT PROPER TO TREAT THEM JUST AS WE WOULD OUR RELATIONS OR PEOPLE IN OUR OWN CLASS OF LIFE NOW IF MAMMY WAS SICK YOU WOULDNT WANT TO PUT HER IN YOUR OWN BED I SHOULD FEEL JUST LIKE IT MAMMA SAID EVA BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD BE HANDIER TO TAKE CARE OF HER AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY BED IS BETTER THAN HERS MARIE WAS IN UTTER DESPAIR AT THE ENTIRE WANT OF MORAL PERCEPTION EVINCED IN THIS REPLY WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE THIS CHILD UNDERSTAND ME SHE SAID NOTHING SAID MISS OPHELIA SIGNIFICANTLY EVA LOOKED SORRY AND DISCONCERTED FOR A MOMENT BUT CHILDREN LUCKILY DO NOT KEEP TO ONE IMPRESSION LONG AND IN A FEW MOMENTS SHE WAS MERRILY LAUGHING AT VARIOUS THINGS WHICH SHE SAW FROM THE COACHWINDOWS AS IT RATTLED ALONG WELL LADIES SAID ST CLARE AS THEY WERE COMFORTABLY SEATED AT THE DINNERTABLE AND WHAT WAS THE BILL OF FARE AT CHURCH TODAY O DR G PREACHED A SPLENDID SERMON SAID MARIE IT WAS JUST SUCH A SERMON AS YOU OUGHT TO HEAR IT EXPRESSED ALL MY VIEWS EXACTLY IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY IMPROVING SAID ST CLARE THE SUBJECT MUST HAVE BEEN AN EXTENSIVE ONE WELL I MEAN ALL MY VIEWS ABOUT SOCIETY AND SUCH THINGS SAID MARIE THE TEXT WAS HE HATH MADE EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL IN ITS SEASON AND HE SHOWED HOW ALL THE ORDERS AND DISTINCTIONS IN SOCIETY CAME FROM GOD AND THAT IT WAS SO APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW AND BEAUTIFUL THAT SOME SHOULD BE HIGH AND SOME LOW AND THAT SOME WERE BORN TO RULE AND SOME TO SERVE AND ALL THAT YOU KNOW AND HE APPLIED IT SO WELL TO ALL THIS RIDICULOUS FUSS THAT IS MADE ABOUT SLAVERY AND HE PROVED DISTINCTLY THAT THE BIBLE WAS ON OUR SIDE AND SUPPORTED ALL OUR INSTITUTIONS SO CONVINCINGLY I ONLY WISH YOUD HEARD HIM O I DIDNT NEED IT SAID ST CLARE I CAN LEARN WHAT DOES ME AS MUCH GOOD AS THAT FROM THE PICAYUNE ANY TIME AND SMOKE A CIGAR BESIDES WHICH I CANT DO YOU KNOW IN A CHURCH WHY SAID MISS OPHELIA DONT YOU BELIEVE IN THESE VIEWS WHOI YOU KNOW IM SUCH A GRACELESS DOG THAT THESE RELIGIOUS ASPECTS OF SUCH SUBJECTS DONT EDIFY ME MUCH IF I WAS TO SAY ANYTHING ON THIS SLAVERY MATTER I WOULD SAY OUT FAIR AND SQUARE WERE IN FOR IT WEVE GOT EM AND MEAN TO KEEP EMITS FOR OUR CONVENIENCE AND OUR INTEREST FOR THATS THE LONG AND SHORT OF ITTHATS JUST THE WHOLE OF WHAT ALL THIS SANCTIFIED STUFF AMOUNTS TO AFTER ALL AND I THINK THAT IT WILL BE INTELLIGIBLE TO EVERYBODY EVERYWHERE I DO THINK AUGUSTINE YOU ARE SO IRREVERENT SAID MARIE I THINK ITS SHOCKING TO HEAR YOU TALK SHOCKING ITS THE TRUTH THIS RELIGIOUS TALK ON SUCH MATTERSWHY DONT THEY CARRY IT A LITTLE FURTHER AND SHOW THE BEAUTY IN ITS SEASON OF A FELLOWS TAKING A GLASS TOO MUCH AND SITTING A LITTLE TOO LATE OVER HIS CARDS AND VARIOUS PROVIDENTIAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THAT SORT WHICH ARE PRETTY FREQUENT AMONG US YOUNG MENWED LIKE TO HEAR THAT THOSE ARE RIGHT AND GODLY TOO WELL SAID MISS OPHELIA DO YOU THINK SLAVERY RIGHT OR WRONG IM NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY OF YOUR HORRID NEW ENGLAND DIRECTNESS COUSIN SAID ST CLARE GAYLY IF I ANSWER THAT QUESTION I KNOW YOULL BE AT ME WITH HALF A DOZEN OTHERS EACH ONE HARDER THAN THE LAST AND IM NOT A GOING TO DEFINE MY POSITION I AM ONE OF THE SORT THAT LIVES BY THROWING STONES AT OTHER PEOPLES GLASS HOUSES BUT I NEVER MEAN TO PUT UP ONE FOR THEM TO STONE THATS JUST THE WAY HES ALWAYS TALKING SAID MARIE YOU CANT GET ANY SATISFACTION OUT OF HIM I BELIEVE ITS JUST BECAUSE HE DONT LIKE RELIGION THAT HES ALWAYS RUNNING OUT IN THIS WAY HES BEEN DOING RELIGION SAID ST CLARE IN A TONE THAT MADE BOTH LADIES LOOK AT HIM RELIGION IS WHAT YOU HEAR AT CHURCH RELIGION IS THAT WHICH CAN BEND AND TURN AND DESCEND AND ASCEND TO FIT EVERY CROOKED PHASE OF SELFISH WORLDLY SOCIETY RELIGION IS THAT RELIGION WHICH IS LESS SCRUPULOUS LESS GENEROUS LESS JUST LESS CONSIDERATE FOR MAN THAN EVEN MY OWN UNGODLY WORLDLY BLINDED NATURE NO WHEN I LOOK FOR A RELIGION I MUST LOOK FOR SOMETHING ABOVE ME AND NOT SOMETHING BENEATH THEN YOU DONT BELIEVE THAT THE BIBLE JUSTIFIES SLAVERY SAID MISS OPHELIA THE BIBLE WAS MY MOTHERS BOOK SAID ST CLARE BY IT SHE LIVED AND DIED AND I WOULD BE VERY SORRY TO THINK IT DID ID AS SOON DESIRE TO HAVE IT PROVED THAT MY MOTHER COULD DRINK BRANDY CHEW TOBACCO AND SWEAR BY WAY OF SATISFYING ME THAT I DID RIGHT IN DOING THE SAME IT WOULDNT MAKE ME AT ALL MORE SATISFIED WITH THESE THINGS IN MYSELF AND IT WOULD TAKE FROM ME THE COMFORT OF RESPECTING HER AND IT REALLY IS A COMFORT IN THIS WORLD TO HAVE ANYTHING ONE CAN RESPECT IN SHORT YOU SEE SAID HE SUDDENLY RESUMING HIS GAY TONE ALL I WANT IS THAT DIFFERENT THINGS BE KEPT IN DIFFERENT BOXES THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK OF SOCIETY BOTH IN EUROPE AND AMERICA IS MADE UP OF VARIOUS THINGS WHICH WILL NOT STAND THE SCRUTINY OF ANY VERY IDEAL STANDARD OF MORALITY ITS PRETTY GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT MEN DONT ASPIRE AFTER THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT BUT ONLY TO DO ABOUT AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE WORLD NOW WHEN ANY ONE SPEAKS UP LIKE A MAN AND SAYS SLAVERY IS NECESSARY TO US WE CANT GET ALONG WITHOUT IT WE SHOULD BE BEGGARED IF WE GIVE IT UP AND OF COURSE WE MEAN TO HOLD ON TO

STOLE LIKE SACRED MUSIC OVER THE HARASSED AND CHAFED SPIRIT OF GEORGE AND AFTER HE CEASED HE SAT WITH A GENTLE AND SUBDUED EXPRESSION ON HIS FINE FEATURES IF THIS WORLD WERE ALL GEORGE SAID SIMEON THEE MIGHT INDEED ASK WHERE IS THE LORD BUT IT IS OFTEN THOSE WHO HAVE LEAST OF ALL IN THIS LIFE WHOM HE CHOOSETH FOR THE KINGDOM PUT THY TRUST IN HIM AND NO MATTER WHAT BEFALLS THEE HERE HE WILL MAKE ALL RIGHT HEREAFTER IF THESE WORDS HAD BEEN SPOKEN BY SOME EASY SELFINDULGENT EXHORTER FROM WHOSE MOUTH THEY MIGHT HAVE COME MERELY AS PIOUS AND RHETORICAL FLOURISH PROPER TO BE USED TO PEOPLE IN DISTRESS PERHAPS THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD MUCH EFFECT BUT COMING FROM ONE WHO DAILY AND CALMLY RISKED FINE AND IMPRISONMENT FOR THE CAUSE OF GOD AND MAN THEY HAD A WEIGHT THAT COULD NOT BUT BE FELT AND BOTH THE POOR DESOLATE FUGITIVES FOUND CALMNESS AND STRENGTH BREATHING INTO THEM FROM IT AND NOW RACHEL TOOK ELIZAS HAND KINDLY AND LED THE WAY TO THE SUPPERTABLE AS THEY WERE SITTING DOWN A LIGHT TAP

RATTLED JUMPED ALMOST FLEW OVER THE FROZEN GROUND BUT PLAINER AND STILL PLAINER CAME THE NOISE OF PURSUING HORSEMEN BEHIND THE WOMEN HEARD IT AND LOOKING ANXIOUSLY OUT SAW FAR IN THE REAR ON THE BROW OF A DISTANT HILL A PARTY OF MEN LOOMING UP AGAINST THE REDSTREAKED SKY OF EARLY DAWN ANOTHER HILL AND THEIR PURSUERS HAD EVIDENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THEIR WAGON WHOSE WHITE CLOTHCOVERED TOP MADE IT CONSPICUOUS AT SOME DISTANCE AND A LOUD YELL OF BRUTAL TRIUMPH CAME FORWARD ON THE WIND ELIZA SICKENED AND STRAINED HER CHILD CLOSER TO HER BOSOM THE OLD WOMAN PRAYED AND GROANED AND GEORGE AND JIM CLENCHED THEIR PISTOLS WITH THE GRASP OF DESPAIR THE PURSUERS GAINED ON THEM FAST THE CARRIAGE MADE A SUDDEN TURN AND BROUGHT THEM NEAR A LEDGE OF A STEEP OVERHANGING ROCK THAT ROSE IN AN ISOLATED RIDGE OR CLUMP IN A LARGE LOT WHICH WAS ALL AROUND IT QUITE CLEAR AND SMOOTH THIS ISOLATED PILE OR RANGE OF ROCKS ROSE UP BLACK AND HEAVY AGAINST THE BRIGHTENING SKY AND SEEMED TO PROMISE SHELTER AND CONCEALMENT IT WAS A PLACE WELL KNOWN TO PHINEAS WHO HAD BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THE SPOT IN HIS HUNTING DAYS AND IT WAS TO GAIN THIS POINT HE HAD BEEN RACING HIS HORSES NOW FOR IT SAID HE SUDDENLY

NURSING REAL NATURAL AND ANT NEVER BETTER SUITED THAN WHEN SHE GETS A SICK BODY TO TEND WE MAY RECKON ON TURNING HIM OVER TO HER FOR A FORTNIGHT OR SO A RIDE OF ABOUT AN HOUR MORE BROUGHT THE PARTY TO A NEAT FARMHOUSE WHERE THE WEARY TRAVELLERS WERE RECEIVED TO AN ABUNDANT BREAKFAST TOM LOKER WAS SOON CAREFULLY DEPOSITED IN A MUCH CLEANER AND SOFTER BED THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN IN THE HABIT OF OCCUPYING HIS WOUND WAS CAREFULLY DRESSED AND BANDAGED AND HE LAY LANGUIDLY OPENING AND SHUTTING HIS EYES ON THE WHITE WINDOWCURTAINS AND GENTLYGLIDING FIGURES OF HIS SICK ROOM LIKE A WEARY CHILD AND HERE FOR THE PRESENT WE SHALL TAKE OUR LEAVE OF ONE PARTY CHAPTER XVIII MISS OPHELIAS EXPERIENCES AND OPINIONS OUR FRIEND TOM IN HIS OWN SIMPLE MUSINGS OFTEN COMPARED HIS MORE FORTUNATE LOT IN THE BONDAGE INTO WHICH HE WAS CAST WITH THAT OF JOSEPH IN EGYPT AND IN FACT AS TIME WENT ON AND HE DEVELOPED MORE AND MORE UNDER THE EYE OF HIS MASTER THE STRENGTH OF THE PARALLEL INCREASED ST CLARE WAS INDOLENT AND CARELESS OF MONEY HITHERTO THE PROVIDING AND MARKETING HAD BEEN PRINCIPALLY DONE BY ADOLPH WHO WAS TO THE FULL AS CARELESS AND EXTRAVAGANT AS HIS MASTER AND BETWEEN THEM BOTH THEY HAD CARRIED ON THE DISPERSING PROCESS WITH GREAT ALACRITY ACCUSTOMED FOR MANY YEARS TO REGARD HIS MASTERS PROPERTY AS HIS OWN CARE TOM SAW WITH AN UNEASINESS HE COULD SCARCELY REPRESS THE WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AND IN THE QUIET INDIRECT WAY WHICH HIS CLASS OFTEN ACQUIRE WOULD SOMETIMES MAKE HIS OWN SUGGESTIONS ST CLARE AT FIRST EMPLOYED HIM OCCASIONALLY BUT STRUCK WITH HIS SOUNDNESS OF MIND AND GOOD BUSINESS CAPACITY HE CONFIDED IN HIM MORE AND MORE TILL GRADUALLY ALL THE MARKETING AND PROVIDING FOR THE FAMILY WERE INTRUSTED TO HIM NO NO ADOLPH HE SAID ONE DAY AS ADOLPH WAS DEPRECATING THE PASSING OF POWER OUT OF HIS HANDS LET TOM ALONE YOU ONLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WANT TOM UNDERSTANDS COST AND COME TO AND THERE MAY BE SOME END TO MONEY BYE AND BYE IF WE DONT LET SOMEBODY DO THAT TRUSTED TO AN UNLIMITED EXTENT BY A CARELESS MASTER WHO HANDED HIM A BILL WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT AND POCKETED THE CHANGE WITHOUT COUNTING IT TOM HAD EVERY FACILITY AND TEMPTATION TO DISHONESTY AND NOTHING BUT AN IMPREGNABLE SIMPLICITY OF NATURE STRENGTHENED BY CHRISTIAN FAITH COULD HAVE KEPT HIM FROM IT BUT TO THAT NATURE THE VERY UNBOUNDED TRUST REPOSED IN HIM WAS BOND AND SEAL FOR THE MOST SCRUPULOUS ACCURACY WITH ADOLPH THE CASE HAD BEEN DIFFERENT THOUGHTLESS AND SELFINDULGENT AND UNRESTRAINED BY A MASTER WHO FOUND IT EASIER TO INDULGE THAN TO REGULATE HE HAD FALLEN INTO AN ABSOLUTE CONFUSION AS TO MEUM TUUM WITH REGARD TO HIMSELF AND HIS MASTER WHICH SOMETIMES TROUBLED EVEN ST CLARE HIS OWN GOOD SENSE TAUGHT HIM THAT SUCH A TRAINING OF HIS SERVANTS WAS UNJUST AND DANGEROUS A SORT OF CHRONIC REMORSE WENT WITH HIM EVERYWHERE ALTHOUGH NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY DECIDED CHANGE IN HIS COURSE AND THIS VERY REMORSE REACTED AGAIN INTO INDULGENCE HE PASSED LIGHTLY OVER THE MOST SERIOUS FAULTS BECAUSE HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IF HE HAD DONE HIS PART HIS DEPENDENTS HAD NOT FALLEN INTO THEM TOM REGARDED HIS GAY AIRY HANDSOME YOUNG MASTER WITH AN ODD MIXTURE OF FEALTY REVERENCE AND FATHERLY SOLICITUDE THAT HE NEVER READ THE BIBLE NEVER WENT TO CHURCH THAT HE JESTED AND MADE FREE WITH ANY AND EVERY THING THAT CAME IN THE WAY OF HIS WIT THAT HE SPENT HIS SUNDAY EVENINGS AT THE OPERA OR THEATRE THAT HE WENT TO WINE PARTIES AND CLUBS AND SUPPERS OFTENER THAN WAS AT ALL EXPEDIENTWERE ALL THINGS THAT TOM COULD SEE AS PLAINLY AS ANYBODY AND ON WHICH HE BASED A CONVICTION THAT MASR WASNT A CHRISTIANA CONVICTION HOWEVER WHICH HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SLOW TO EXPRESS TO ANY ONE ELSE BUT ON WHICH HE FOUNDED MANY PRAYERS IN HIS OWN SIMPLE FASHION WHEN HE WAS BY HIMSELF IN HIS LITTLE DORMITORY NOT THAT TOM HAD NOT HIS OWN WAY OF SPEAKING HIS MIND OCCASIONALLY WITH SOMETHING OF THE TACT OFTEN OBSERVABLE IN HIS CLASS AS FOR EXAMPLE THE VERY DAY AFTER THE SABBATH WE HAVE DESCRIBED ST CLARE WAS INVITED OUT TO A CONVIVIAL PARTY OF CHOICE SPIRITS AND WAS HELPED HOME BETWEEN ONE AND TWO OCLOCK AT NIGHT IN A CONDITION WHEN THE PHYSICAL HAD DECIDEDLY ATTAINED THE UPPER HAND OF THE INTELLECTUAL TOM AND ADOLPH ASSISTED TO GET HIM COMPOSED FOR THE NIGHT THE LATTER IN HIGH SPIRITS EVIDENTLY REGARDING THE MATTER AS A GOOD JOKE AND LAUGHING HEARTILY AT THE RUSTICITY OF TOMS HORROR WHO REALLY WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH TO LIE AWAKE MOST OF THE REST OF THE NIGHT PRAYING FOR HIS YOUNG MASTER WELL TOM WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR SAID ST CLARE THE NEXT DAY AS HE SAT IN HIS LIBRARY IN DRESSINGGOWN AND SLIPPERS ST CLARE HAD JUST BEEN ENTRUSTING TOM WITH SOME MONEY AND VARIOUS COMMISSIONS ISNT ALL RIGHT THERE TOM HE ADDED AS TOM STILL STOOD WAITING IM FRAID NOT MASR SAID TOM WITH A GRAVE FACE ST CLARE LAID DOWN HIS PAPER AND SET DOWN HIS COFFEECUP AND LOOKED AT TOM WHY TOM WHATS THE CASE YOU LOOK AS SOLEMN AS A COFFIN I FEEL VERY BAD MASR I ALLAYS HAVE THOUGHT THAT MASR WOULD BE GOOD TO EVERYBODY WELL TOM HAVENT I BEEN COME NOW WHAT DO YOU WANT THERES SOMETHING YOU HAVENT GOT I SUPPOSE AND THIS IS THE PREFACE MASR ALLAYS BEEN GOOD TO ME I HAVENT NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF ON THAT HEAD BUT THERE IS ONE THAT MASR ISNT GOOD TO WHY TOM WHATS GOT INTO YOU SPEAK OUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN LAST NIGHT BETWEEN ONE AND TWO I THOUGHT SO I STUDIED UPON THE MATTER THEN MASR ISNT GOOD TO HIMSELF TOM SAID THIS WITH HIS BACK TO HIS MASTER AND HIS HAND ON THE DOORKNOB ST CLARE FELT HIS FACE FLUSH CRIMSON BUT HE LAUGHED O THATS ALL IS IT HE SAID GAYLY ALL SAID TOM TURNING SUDDENLY ROUND AND FALLING ON HIS KNEES O MY DEAR YOUNG MASR IM FRAID IT WILL BE LOSS OF ALLALLBODY AND SOUL THE GOOD BOOK SAYS IT BITETH LIKE A SERPENT AND STINGETH LIKE AN ADDER MY DEAR MASR TOMS VOICE CHOKED AND THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS YOU POOR SILLY FOOL SAID ST CLARE WITH TEARS IN HIS OWN EYES GET UP TOM IM NOT WORTH CRYING OVER BUT TOM WOULDNT RISE AND LOOKED IMPLORING WELL I WONT GO TO ANY MORE OF THEIR CURSED NONSENSE TOM SAID ST CLARE ON MY HONOR I WONT I DONT KNOW WHY I HAVENT STOPPED LONG AGO IVE ALWAYS DESPISED IT AND MYSELF FOR ITSO NOW TOM WIPE UP YOUR EYES AND GO ABOUT YOUR ERRANDS COME COME HE ADDED NO BLESSINGS IM NOT SO WONDERFULLY GOOD NOW HE SAID AS HE GENTLY PUSHED TOM TO THE DOOR THERE ILL PLEDGE MY HONOR TO YOU TOM YOU DONT SEE ME SO AGAIN HE SAID AND TOM WENT OFF WIPING HIS EYES WITH GREAT SATISFACTION ILL KEEP MY FAITH WITH HIM TOO SAID ST CLARE AS HE CLOSED THE DOOR AND ST CLARE DID SOFOR GROSS SENSUALISM IN ANY FORM WAS NOT THE PECULIAR TEMPTATION OF HIS NATURE BUT ALL THIS TIME WHO SHALL DETAIL THE TRIBULATIONS MANIFOLD OF OUR FRIEND MISS OPHELIA WHO HAD BEGUN THE LABORS OF A SOUTHERN HOUSEKEEPER THERE IS ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD IN THE SERVANTS OF SOUTHERN ESTABLISHMENTS ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTER AND CAPACITY OF THE MISTRESSES WHO HAVE BROUGHT THEM UP SOUTH AS WELL AS NORTH THERE ARE WOMEN WHO HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY TALENT FOR COMMAND AND TACT IN EDUCATING SUCH ARE ENABLED WITH APPARENT EASE AND WITHOUT SEVERITY TO SUBJECT TO THEIR WILL AND BRING INTO HARMONIOUS AND SYSTEMATIC ORDER THE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THEIR SMALL ESTATETO REGULATE THEIR PECULIARITIES AND SO BALANCE AND COMPENSATE THE DEFICIENCIES OF ONE BY THE EXCESS OF ANOTHER AS TO PRODUCE A HARMONIOUS AND ORDERLY SYSTEM SUCH A HOUSEKEEPER WAS MRS SHELBY WHOM WE HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED AND SUCH OUR READERS MAY REMEMBER TO HAVE MET WITH IF THEY ARE NOT COMMON AT THE SOUTH IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT COMMON IN THE WORLD THEY ARE TO BE FOUND THERE AS OFTEN AS ANYWHERE AND WHEN EXISTING FIND IN THAT PECULIAR STATE OF SOCIETY A BRILLIANT OPPORTUNITY TO EXHIBIT THEIR DOMESTIC TALENT SUCH A HOUSEKEEPER MARIE ST CLARE WAS NOT NOR HER MOTHER BEFORE HER INDOLENT AND CHILDISH UNSYSTEMATIC AND IMPROVIDENT IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT SERVANTS TRAINED UNDER HER CARE SHOULD NOT BE SO LIKEWISE AND SHE HAD VERY JUSTLY DESCRIBED TO MISS OPHELIA THE STATE OF CONFUSION SHE WOULD FIND IN THE FAMILY THOUGH SHE HAD NOT ASCRIBED IT TO THE PROPER CAUSE THE FIRST MORNING OF HER REGENCY MISS OPHELIA WAS UP AT FOUR OCLOCK AND HAVING ATTENDED TO ALL THE ADJUSTMENTS OF HER OWN CHAMBER AS SHE HAD DONE EVER SINCE SHE CAME THERE TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE CHAMBERMAID SHE PREPARED FOR A VIGOROUS ONSLAUGHT ON THE CUPBOARDS AND CLOSETS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF WHICH SHE HAD THE KEYS THE STOREROOM THE LINENPRESSES THE CHINACLOSET THE KITCHEN AND CELLAR THAT DAY ALL WENT UNDER AN AWFUL REVIEW HIDDEN THINGS OF DARKNESS WERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT TO AN EXTENT THAT ALARMED ALL THE PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS OF KITCHEN AND CHAMBER AND CAUSED MANY WONDERINGS AND MURMURINGS ABOUT DESE YER NORTHERN LADIES FROM THE DOMESTIC CABINET OLD DINAH THE HEAD COOK AND PRINCIPAL OF ALL RULE AND AUTHORITY IN THE KITCHEN DEPARTMENT WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AT WHAT SHE CONSIDERED AN INVASION OF PRIVILEGE NO FEUDAL BARON IN MAGNA CHARTA TIMES COULD HAVE MORE THOROUGHLY RESENTED SOME INCURSION OF THE CROWN DINAH WAS A CHARACTER IN HER OWN WAY AND IT WOULD BE INJUSTICE TO HER MEMORY NOT TO GIVE THE READER A LITTLE IDEA OF HER SHE WAS A NATIVE AND ESSENTIAL COOK AS MUCH AS AUNT CHLOECOOKING BEING AN INDIGENOUS TALENT OF THE AFRICAN RACE BUT CHLOE WAS A TRAINED AND METHODICAL ONE WHO MOVED IN AN ORDERLY DOMESTIC HARNESS WHILE DINAH WAS A SELFTAUGHT GENIUS AND LIKE GENIUSES IN GENERAL WAS POSITIVE OPINIONATED AND ERRATIC TO THE LAST DEGREE LIKE A CERTAIN CLASS OF MODERN PHILOSOPHERS DINAH PERFECTLY SCORNED LOGIC AND REASON IN EVERY SHAPE AND ALWAYS TOOK REFUGE IN INTUITIVE CERTAINTY AND HERE SHE WAS PERFECTLY IMPREGNABLE NO POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF TALENT OR AUTHORITY OR EXPLANATION COULD EVER MAKE HER BELIEVE THAT ANY OTHER WAY WAS BETTER THAN HER OWN OR THAT THE COURSE SHE HAD PURSUED IN THE SMALLEST MATTER COULD BE IN THE LEAST MODIFIED THIS HAD BEEN A CONCEDED POINT WITH HER OLD MISTRESS MARIES MOTHER AND MISS MARIE AS DINAH ALWAYS CALLED HER YOUNG MISTRESS EVEN AFTER HER MARRIAGE FOUND IT EASIER TO SUBMIT THAN CONTEND AND SO DINAH HAD RULED SUPREME THIS WAS THE EASIER IN THAT SHE WAS PERFECT MISTRESS OF THAT DIPLOMATIC ART WHICH UNITES THE UTMOST SUBSERVIENCE OF MANNER WITH THE UTMOST INFLEXIBILITY AS TO MEASURE DINAH WAS MISTRESS OF THE WHOLE ART AND MYSTERY OF EXCUSEMAKING IN ALL ITS BRANCHES INDEED IT WAS AN AXIOM WITH HER THAT THE COOK CAN DO NO WRONG AND A COOK IN A SOUTHERN KITCHEN FINDS ABUNDANCE OF HEADS AND SHOULDERS ON WHICH TO LAY OFF EVERY SIN AND FRAILTY SO AS TO MAINTAIN HER OWN IMMACULATENESS ENTIRE IF ANY PART OF THE DINNER WAS A FAILURE THERE WERE FIFTY INDISPUTABLY GOOD REASONS FOR IT AND IT WAS THE FAULT UNDENIABLY OF FIFTY OTHER PEOPLE WHOM DINAH BERATED WITH UNSPARING ZEAL BUT IT WAS VERY SELDOM THAT THERE WAS ANY FAILURE IN DINAHS LAST RESULTS THOUGH HER MODE OF DOING EVERYTHING WAS PECULIARLY MEANDERING AND CIRCUITOUS AND WITHOUT ANY SORT OF CALCULATION AS TO TIME AND PLACETHOUGH HER KITCHEN GENERALLY LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN ARRANGED BY A HURRICANE BLOWING THROUGH IT AND SHE HAD ABOUT AS MANY PLACES FOR EACH COOKING UTENSIL AS THERE WERE DAYS IN THE YEARYET IF ONE WOULD HAVE PATIENCE TO WAIT HER OWN GOOD TIME UP WOULD COME HER DINNER IN PERFECT ORDER AND IN A STYLE OF PREPARATION WITH WHICH AN EPICURE COULD FIND NO FAULT IT WAS NOW THE SEASON OF INCIPIENT PREPARATION FOR DINNER DINAH WHO REQUIRED LARGE INTERVALS OF REFLECTION AND REPOSE AND WAS STUDIOUS OF EASE IN ALL HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS SEATED ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR SMOKING A SHORT STUMPY PIPE TO WHICH SHE WAS MUCH ADDICTED AND WHICH SHE ALWAYS KINDLED UP AS A SORT OF CENSER WHENEVER SHE FELT THE NEED OF AN INSPIRATION IN HER ARRANGEMENTS IT WAS DINAHS MODE OF INVOKING THE DOMESTIC MUSES SEATED AROUND HER WERE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THAT RISING RACE WITH WHICH A SOUTHERN HOUSEHOLD ABOUNDS ENGAGED IN SHELLING PEAS PEELING POTATOES PICKING PINFEATHERS OUT OF FOWLS AND OTHER PREPARATORY ARRANGEMENTSDINAH EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE INTERRUPTING HER MEDITATIONS TO GIVE A POKE OR A RAP ON THE HEAD TO SOME OF THE YOUNG OPERATORS WITH THE PUDDINGSTICK THAT LAY BY HER SIDE IN FACT DINAH RULED OVER THE WOOLLY HEADS OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WITH A ROD OF IRON AND SEEMED TO CONSIDER THEM BORN FOR NO EARTHLY PURPOSE BUT TO SAVE HER STEPS AS SHE PHRASED IT IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF THE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH SHE HAD GROWN UP AND SHE CARRIED IT OUT TO ITS FULL EXTENT MISS OPHELIA AFTER PASSING ON HER REFORMATORY TOUR THROUGH ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT NOW ENTERED THE KITCHEN DINAH HAD HEARD FROM VARIOUS SOURCES WHAT WAS GOING ON AND RESOLVED TO STAND ON DEFENSIVE AND CONSERVATIVE GROUNDMENTALLY DETERMINED TO OPPOSE AND IGNORE EVERY NEW MEASURE WITHOUT ANY ACTUAL OBSERVABLE CONTEST THE KITCHEN WAS A LARGE BRICKFLOORED APARTMENT WITH A GREAT OLDFASHIONED FIREPLACE STRETCHING ALONG ONE SIDE OF ITAN ARRANGEMENT WHICH ST CLARE HAD VAINLY TRIED TO PERSUADE DINAH TO EXCHANGE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF A MODERN COOKSTOVE NOT SHE NO PUSEYITE OR CONSERVATIVE OF ANY SCHOOL WAS EVER MORE INFLEXIBLY ATTACHED TO TIMEHONORED INCONVENIENCES THAN DINAH EDWARD BOUVERIE PUSEY CHAMPION OF THE ORTHODOXY OF REVEALED RELIGION DEFENDER OF THE OXFORD MOVEMENT AND REGIUS PROFESSOR OF HEBREW AND CANON OF CHRIST CHURCH OXFORD WHEN ST CLARE HAD FIRST RETURNED FROM THE NORTH IMPRESSED WITH THE SYSTEM AND ORDER OF HIS UNCLES KITCHEN ARRANGEMENTS HE HAD LARGELY PROVIDED HIS OWN WITH AN ARRAY OF CUPBOARDS DRAWERS AND VARIOUS APPARATUS TO INDUCE SYSTEMATIC REGULATION UNDER THE SANGUINE ILLUSION THAT IT WOULD BE OF ANY POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE TO DINAH IN HER ARRANGEMENTS HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE PROVIDED THEM FOR A SQUIRREL OR A MAGPIE THE MORE DRAWERS AND CLOSETS THERE WERE THE MORE HIDINGHOLES COULD DINAH MAKE FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF OLD RAGS HAIRCOMBS OLD SHOES RIBBONS CASTOFF ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS AND OTHER ARTICLES OF VERTU WHEREIN HER SOUL DELIGHTED WHEN MISS OPHELIA ENTERED THE KITCHEN DINAH DID NOT RISE BUT SMOKED ON IN SUBLIME TRANQUILLITY REGARDING HER MOVEMENTS OBLIQUELY OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE BUT APPARENTLY INTENT ONLY ON THE OPERATIONS AROUND HER MISS OPHELIA COMMENCED OPENING A SET OF DRAWERS WHAT IS THIS DRAWER FOR DINAH SHE SAID ITS HANDY FOR MOST ANYTHING MISSIS SAID DINAH SO IT APPEARED TO BE FROM THE VARIETY IT CONTAINED MISS OPHELIA PULLED OUT FIRST A FINE DAMASK TABLECLOTH STAINED

WHEN SHE WOULD BEGIN WITH GREAT ZEAL AND TURN EVERY DRAWER AND CLOSET WRONG SIDE OUTWARD ON TO THE FLOOR OR TABLES AND MAKE THE ORDINARY CONFUSION SEVENFOLD MORE CONFOUNDED THEN SHE WOULD LIGHT HER PIPE AND LEISURELY GO OVER HER ARRANGEMENTS LOOKING THINGS OVER AND DISCOURSING UPON THEM MAKING ALL THE YOUNG FRY SCOUR MOST VIGOROUSLY ON THE TIN THINGS AND KEEPING UP FOR SEVERAL HOURS A MOST ENERGETIC STATE OF CONFUSION WHICH SHE WOULD EXPLAIN TO THE SATISFACTION OF ALL INQUIRERS BY THE REMARK THAT SHE WAS A CLARIN UP SHE COULDNT HEV THINGS A GWINE ON SO AS THEY HAD BEEN AND SHE WAS GWINE TO MAKE THESE YER YOUNG ONES KEEP BETTER ORDER FOR DINAH HERSELF SOMEHOW INDULGED THE ILLUSION THAT SHE HERSELF WAS THE SOUL OF ORDER AND IT WAS ONLY THE YOUNG UNS AND THE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE THAT WERE THE CAUSE OF ANYTHING THAT FELL SHORT OF PERFECTION IN THIS RESPECT WHEN ALL THE TINS WERE SCOURED AND THE TABLES SCRUBBED SNOWY WHITE AND EVERYTHING THAT COULD OFFEND TUCKED OUT OF SIGHT IN HOLES AND CORNERS DINAH WOULD DRESS HERSELF UP IN A SMART DRESS CLEAN APRON AND HIGH BRILLIANT MADRAS TURBAN AND TELL ALL MARAUDING YOUNG UNS TO KEEP OUT OF THE KITCHEN FOR SHE WAS GWINE TO HAVE THINGS KEPT NICE INDEED THESE PERIODIC SEASONS WERE OFTEN AN INCONVENIENCE TO THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD FOR DINAH WOULD CONTRACT SUCH AN IMMODERATE ATTACHMENT TO HER SCOURED TIN AS TO INSIST UPON IT THAT IT SHOULDNT BE USED AGAIN FOR ANY POSSIBLE PURPOSEAT LEAST TILL THE ARDOR OF THE CLARIN UP PERIOD ABATED MISS OPHELIA IN A FEW DAYS THOROUGHLY REFORMED EVERY DEPARTMENT OF THE HOUSE TO A SYSTEMATIC PATTERN BUT HER LABORS IN ALL DEPARTMENTS THAT DEPENDED ON THE COOPERATION OF SERVANTS WERE LIKE THOSE OF SISYPHUS OR THE DANAIDES IN DESPAIR SHE ONE DAY APPEALED TO ST CLARE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS

DEAR COUSIN I DIDNT DO IT AND I CANT HELP IT I WOULD IF I COULD IF LOWMINDED BRUTAL PEOPLE WILL ACT LIKE THEMSELVES WHAT AM I TO DO THEY HAVE ABSOLUTE CONTROL THEY ARE IRRESPONSIBLE DESPOTS THERE

HOT WEATHER WHAT WITH MOSQUITOS AND ALL A FELLOW CANT GET HIMSELF UP TO ANY VERY SUBLIME MORAL FLIGHTS AND I BELIEVE SAID ST CLARE SUDDENLY ROUSING HIMSELF UP THERES A THEORY NOW I UNDERSTAND NOW WHY NORTHERN NATIONS ARE ALWAYS MORE VIRTUOUS THAN SOUTHERN ONESI SEE INTO THAT WHOLE SUBJECT O AUGUSTINE YOU ARE A SAD RATTLEBRAIN AM I WELL SO I AM I SUPPOSE BUT FOR ONCE I WILL BE SERIOUS NOW BUT YOU MUST HAND ME THAT BASKET OF ORANGESYOU SEE YOULL HAVE TO STAY ME WITH FLAGONS AND COMFORT ME WITH APPLES IF IM GOING TO MAKE THIS EFFORT NOW SAID AUGUSTINE DRAWING THE BASKET UP ILL BEGIN WHEN IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVENTS IT BECOMES NECESSARY FOR A FELLOW TO HOLD TWO OR THREE DOZEN OF HIS FELLOWWORMS IN CAPTIVITY A DECENT REGARD TO THE OPINIONS OF SOCIETY REQUIRES I DONT SEE THAT YOU ARE GROWING MORE SERIOUS SAID MISS OPHELIA WAITIM COMING ONYOULL HEAR THE SHORT OF THE MATTER IS COUSIN SAID HE HIS HANDSOME FACE SUDDENLY SETTLING INTO AN EARNEST AND SERIOUS EXPRESSION ON THIS ABSTRACT QUESTION OF SLAVERY THERE CAN AS I THINK BE BUT ONE OPINION PLANTERS WHO HAVE MONEY TO MAKE BY ITCLERGYMEN WHO HAVE PLANTERS TO PLEASEPOLITICIANS WHO WANT TO RULE BY ITMAY WARP AND BEND LANGUAGE AND ETHICS TO A DEGREE THAT SHALL ASTONISH THE WORLD AT THEIR INGENUITY THEY CAN PRESS NATURE AND THE BIBLE AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT ELSE INTO THE SERVICE BUT AFTER ALL NEITHER THEY NOR THE WORLD BELIEVE IN IT ONE PARTICLE THE MORE IT COMES FROM THE DEVIL THATS THE SHORT OF ITAND TO MY MIND ITS A PRETTY RESPECTABLE SPECIMEN OF WHAT HE CAN DO IN HIS OWN LINE MISS OPHELIA STOPPED HER KNITTING AND LOOKED SURPRISED AND ST CLARE APPARENTLY ENJOYING HER ASTONISHMENT WENT ON YOU SEEM TO WONDER BUT IF YOU WILL GET ME FAIRLY AT IT ILL MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT THIS CURSED BUSINESS ACCURSED OF GOD AND MAN WHAT IS IT STRIP IT OF ALL ITS ORNAMENT RUN IT DOWN TO THE ROOT AND NUCLEUS OF THE WHOLE AND WHAT IS IT WHY BECAUSE MY BROTHER QUASHY IS IGNORANT AND WEAK AND I AM INTELLIGENT AND STRONGBECAUSE I KNOW HOW AND CAN DO ITTHEREFORE I MAY STEAL ALL HE HAS KEEP IT AND GIVE HIM ONLY SUCH AND SO MUCH AS SUITS MY FANCY WHATEVER IS TOO HARD TOO DIRTY TOO DISAGREEABLE FOR ME I MAY SET QUASHY TO DOING BECAUSE I DONT LIKE WORK QUASHY SHALL WORK BECAUSE THE SUN BURNS ME QUASHY SHALL STAY IN THE SUN QUASHY SHALL EARN THE MONEY AND I WILL SPEND IT QUASHY SHALL LIE DOWN IN EVERY PUDDLE THAT I MAY WALK OVER DRYSHOD QUASHY SHALL DO MY WILL AND NOT HIS ALL THE DAYS OF HIS MORTAL LIFE AND HAVE SUCH CHANCE OF GETTING TO HEAVEN AT LAST AS I FIND CONVENIENT THIS I TAKE TO BE ABOUT WHAT SLAVERY IS I DEFY ANYBODY ON EARTH TO READ OUR SLAVECODE AS IT STANDS IN OUR LAWBOOKS AND MAKE ANYTHING ELSE OF IT TALK OF THE ABUSES OF SLAVERY HUMBUG THE THING ITSELF IS THE ESSENCE OF ALL ABUSE AND THE ONLY REASON WHY THE LAND DONT SINK UNDER IT LIKE SODOM AND GOMORRAH IS BECAUSE IT IS USED IN A WAY INFINITELY BETTER THAN IT IS FOR PITYS SAKE FOR SHAMES SAKE BECAUSE WE ARE MEN BORN OF WOMEN AND NOT SAVAGE BEASTS MANY OF US DO NOT AND DARE NOTWE WOULD SCORN TO USE THE FULL POWER WHICH OUR SAVAGE LAWS PUT INTO OUR HANDS AND HE WHO GOES THE FURTHEST AND DOES THE WORST ONLY USES WITHIN LIMITS THE POWER THAT THE LAW GIVES HIM ST CLARE HAD STARTED UP AND AS HIS MANNER WAS WHEN EXCITED WAS WALKING WITH HURRIED STEPS UP AND DOWN THE FLOOR HIS FINE FACE CLASSIC AS THAT OF A GREEK STATUE SEEMED ACTUALLY TO BURN WITH THE FERVOR OF HIS FEELINGS HIS LARGE BLUE EYES FLASHED AND HE GESTURED WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS EAGERNESS MISS OPHELIA HAD NEVER SEEN HIM IN THIS MOOD BEFORE AND SHE SAT PERFECTLY SILENT I DECLARE TO YOU SAID HE SUDDENLY STOPPING BEFORE HIS COUSIN ITS NO SORT OF USE TO TALK OR TO FEEL ON THIS SUBJECT BUT I DECLARE TO YOU THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN I HAVE THOUGHT IF THE WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD SINK AND HIDE ALL THIS INJUSTICE AND MISERY FROM THE LIGHT I WOULD WILLINGLY SINK WITH IT WHEN I HAVE BEEN TRAVELLING UP AND DOWN ON OUR BOATS OR ABOUT ON MY COLLECTING TOURS AND REFLECTED THAT EVERY BRUTAL DISGUSTING MEAN LOWLIVED FELLOW I MET WAS ALLOWED BY OUR LAWS TO BECOME ABSOLUTE DESPOT OF AS MANY MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN AS HE COULD CHEAT STEAL OR GAMBLE MONEY ENOUGH TO BUYWHEN I HAVE SEEN SUCH MEN IN ACTUAL OWNERSHIP OF HELPLESS CHILDREN OF YOUNG GIRLS AND WOMENI HAVE BEEN READY TO CURSE MY COUNTRY TO CURSE THE HUMAN RACE AUGUSTINE AUGUSTINE SAID MISS OPHELIA IM SURE YOUVE SAID ENOUGH I NEVER IN MY LIFE HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVEN AT THE NORTH AT THE NORTH SAID ST CLARE WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE OF EXPRESSION AND RESUMING SOMETHING OF HIS HABITUAL CARELESS TONE POOH YOUR NORTHERN FOLKS ARE COLDBLOODED YOU ARE COOL IN EVERYTHING YOU CANT BEGIN TO CURSE UP HILL AND DOWN AS WE CAN WHEN WE GET FAIRLY AT IT WELL BUT THE QUESTION IS SAID MISS OPHELIA O YES TO BE SURE THE QUESTION ISAND A DEUCE OF A QUESTION IT IS HOW CAME YOU IN THIS STATE OF SIN AND MISERY WELL I SHALL ANSWER IN THE GOOD OLD WORDS YOU USED TO TEACH ME SUNDAYS I CAME SO BY ORDINARY GENERATION MY SERVANTS WERE MY FATHERS AND WHAT IS MORE MY MOTHERS AND NOW THEY ARE MINE THEY AND THEIR INCREASE WHICH BIDS FAIR TO BE A PRETTY CONSIDERABLE ITEM MY FATHER YOU KNOW CAME FIRST FROM NEW ENGLAND AND HE WAS JUST SUCH ANOTHER MAN AS YOUR FATHERA REGULAR OLD ROMANUPRIGHT ENERGETIC NOBLEMINDED WITH AN IRON WILL YOUR FATHER SETTLED DOWN IN NEW ENGLAND TO RULE OVER ROCKS AND STONES AND TO FORCE AN EXISTENCE OUT OF NATURE AND MINE SETTLED IN LOUISIANA TO RULE OVER MEN AND WOMEN AND FORCE EXISTENCE OUT OF THEM MY MOTHER SAID ST CLARE GETTING UP AND WALKING TO A PICTURE AT THE END OF THE ROOM AND GAZING UPWARD WITH A FACE FERVENT WITH VENERATION SHE WAS DIVINE DONT LOOK AT ME SOYOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SHE PROBABLY WAS OF MORTAL BIRTH BUT AS FAR AS EVER I COULD OBSERVE THERE WAS NO TRACE OF ANY HUMAN WEAKNESS OR ERROR ABOUT HER AND EVERYBODY THAT LIVES TO REMEMBER HER WHETHER BOND OR FREE SERVANT ACQUAINTANCE RELATION ALL SAY THE SAME WHY COUSIN THAT MOTHER HAS BEEN ALL THAT HAS STOOD BETWEEN ME AND UTTER UNBELIEF FOR YEARS SHE WAS A DIRECT EMBODIMENT AND PERSONIFICATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENTA LIVING FACT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN NO OTHER WAY THAN BY ITS TRUTH O MOTHER MOTHER SAID ST CLARE CLASPING HIS HANDS IN A SORT OF TRANSPORT AND THEN SUDDENLY CHECKING HIMSELF HE CAME BACK AND SEATING HIMSELF ON AN OTTOMAN HE WENT ON MY BROTHER AND I WERE TWINS AND THEY SAY YOU KNOW THAT TWINS OUGHT TO RESEMBLE EACH OTHER BUT WE WERE IN ALL POINTS A CONTRAST HE HAD BLACK FIERY EYES COALBLACK HAIR A STRONG FINE ROMAN PROFILE AND A RICH BROWN COMPLEXION I HAD BLUE EYES GOLDEN HAIR A GREEK OUTLINE AND FAIR COMPLEXION HE WAS ACTIVE AND OBSERVING I DREAMY AND INACTIVE HE WAS GENEROUS TO HIS FRIENDS AND EQUALS BUT PROUD DOMINANT OVERBEARING TO INFERIORS AND UTTERLY UNMERCIFUL TO WHATEVER SET ITSELF UP AGAINST HIM TRUTHFUL WE BOTH WERE HE FROM PRIDE AND COURAGE I FROM A SORT OF ABSTRACT IDEALITY WE LOVED EACH OTHER ABOUT AS BOYS GENERALLY DOOFF AND ON AND IN GENERALHE WAS MY FATHERS PET AND I MY MOTHERS THERE WAS A MORBID SENSITIVENESS AND ACUTENESS OF FEELING IN ME ON ALL POSSIBLE SUBJECTS OF WHICH HE AND MY FATHER HAD NO KIND OF UNDERSTANDING AND WITH WHICH THEY COULD HAVE NO POSSIBLE SYMPATHY BUT MOTHER DID AND SO WHEN I HAD QUARRELED WITH ALFRED AND FATHER LOOKED STERNLY ON ME I USED TO GO OFF TO MOTHERS ROOM AND SIT BY HER I REMEMBER JUST HOW SHE USED TO LOOK WITH HER PALE CHEEKS HER DEEP SOFT SERIOUS EYES HER WHITE DRESSSHE ALWAYS WORE WHITE AND I USED TO THINK OF HER WHENEVER I READ IN REVELATIONS ABOUT THE SAINTS THAT WERE ARRAYED IN FINE LINEN CLEAN AND WHITE SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF GENIUS OF ONE SORT AND ANOTHER PARTICULARLY IN MUSIC AND SHE USED TO SIT AT HER ORGAN PLAYING FINE OLD MAJESTIC MUSIC OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND SINGING WITH A VOICE MORE LIKE AN ANGEL THAN A MORTAL WOMAN AND I WOULD LAY MY HEAD DOWN ON HER LAP AND CRY AND DREAM AND FEELOH IMMEASURABLYTHINGS THAT I HAD NO LANGUAGE TO SAY IN THOSE DAYS THIS MATTER OF SLAVERY HAD NEVER BEEN CANVASSED AS IT HAS NOW NOBODY DREAMED OF ANY HARM IN IT MY FATHER WAS A BORN ARISTOCRAT I THINK IN SOME PREEXISTENT STATE HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE HIGHER CIRCLES OF SPIRITS AND BROUGHT ALL HIS OLD COURT PRIDE ALONG WITH HIM FOR IT WAS INGRAIN BRED IN THE BONE THOUGH HE WAS ORIGINALLY OF POOR AND NOT IN ANY WAY OF NOBLE FAMILY MY BROTHER WAS BEGOTTEN IN HIS IMAGE NOW AN ARISTOCRAT YOU KNOW THE WORLD OVER HAS NO HUMAN SYMPATHIES BEYOND A CERTAIN LINE IN SOCIETY IN ENGLAND THE LINE IS IN ONE PLACE IN BURMAH IN ANOTHER AND IN AMERICA IN ANOTHER BUT THE ARISTOCRAT OF ALL THESE COUNTRIES NEVER GOES OVER IT WHAT WOULD BE HARDSHIP AND DISTRESS AND INJUSTICE IN HIS OWN CLASS IS A COOL MATTER OF COURSE IN ANOTHER ONE MY FATHERS DIVIDING LINE WAS THAT OF COLOR AMONG HIS EQUALS NEVER WAS A MAN MORE JUST AND GENEROUS BUT HE CONSIDERED THE NEGRO THROUGH ALL POSSIBLE GRADATIONS OF COLOR AS AN INTERMEDIATE LINK BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMALS AND GRADED ALL HIS IDEAS OF JUSTICE OR GENEROSITY ON THIS HYPOTHESIS I SUPPOSE TO BE SURE IF ANYBODY HAD ASKED HIM PLUMP AND FAIR WHETHER THEY HAD HUMAN IMMORTAL SOULS HE MIGHT HAVE HEMMED AND HAWED AND SAID YES BUT MY FATHER WAS NOT A MAN MUCH TROUBLED WITH SPIRITUALISM RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT HE HAD NONE BEYOND A VENERATION FOR GOD AS DECIDEDLY THE HEAD OF THE UPPER CLASSES WELL MY FATHER WORKED SOME FIVE HUNDRED NEGROES HE WAS AN INFLEXIBLE DRIVING PUNCTILIOUS BUSINESS MAN EVERYTHING WAS TO MOVE BY SYSTEMTO BE SUSTAINED WITH UNFAILING ACCURACY AND PRECISION NOW IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT ALL THIS WAS TO BE WORKED OUT BY A SET OF LAZY TWADDLING SHIFTLESS LABORERS WHO HAD GROWN UP ALL THEIR LIVES IN THE ABSENCE OF EVERY POSSIBLE MOTIVE TO LEARN HOW TO DO ANYTHING BUT SHIRK AS YOU VERMONTERS SAY AND YOULL SEE THAT THERE MIGHT NATURALLY BE ON HIS PLANTATION A GREAT MANY THINGS THAT LOOKED HORRIBLE AND DISTRESSING TO A SENSITIVE CHILD LIKE ME BESIDES ALL HE HAD AN OVERSEERGREAT TALL SLABSIDED TWOFISTED RENEGADE SON OF VERMONTBEGGING YOUR PARDONWHO HAD GONE THROUGH A REGULAR APPRENTICESHIP IN HARDNESS AND BRUTALITY AND TAKEN HIS DEGREE TO BE ADMITTED TO PRACTICE MY MOTHER NEVER COULD ENDURE HIM NOR I BUT HE OBTAINED AN ENTIRE ASCENDENCY OVER MY FATHER AND THIS MAN WAS THE ABSOLUTE DESPOT OF THE ESTATE I WAS A LITTLE FELLOW THEN BUT I HAD THE SAME LOVE THAT I HAVE NOW FOR ALL KINDS OF HUMAN THINGSA KIND OF PASSION FOR THE STUDY OF HUMANITY COME IN WHAT SHAPE IT WOULD I WAS FOUND IN THE CABINS AND AMONG THE FIELDHANDS A GREAT DEAL AND OF COURSE WAS A GREAT FAVORITE AND ALL SORTS OF COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES WERE BREATHED IN MY EAR AND I TOLD THEM TO MOTHER AND WE BETWEEN US FORMED A SORT OF COMMITTEE FOR A REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES WE HINDERED AND REPRESSED A GREAT DEAL OF CRUELTY AND CONGRATULATED OURSELVES ON DOING A VAST DEAL OF GOOD TILL AS OFTEN HAPPENS MY ZEAL OVERACTED STUBBS COMPLAINED TO MY FATHER THAT HE COULDNT MANAGE THE HANDS AND MUST RESIGN HIS POSITION FATHER WAS A FOND INDULGENT HUSBAND BUT A MAN THAT NEVER FLINCHED FROM ANYTHING THAT HE THOUGHT NECESSARY AND SO HE PUT DOWN HIS FOOT LIKE A ROCK BETWEEN US AND THE FIELDHANDS HE TOLD MY MOTHER IN LANGUAGE PERFECTLY RESPECTFUL AND DEFERENTIAL BUT QUITE EXPLICIT THAT OVER THE HOUSESERVANTS SHE SHOULD BE ENTIRE MISTRESS BUT THAT WITH THE FIELDHANDS HE COULD ALLOW NO INTERFERENCE HE REVERED AND RESPECTED HER ABOVE ALL LIVING BEINGS BUT HE WOULD HAVE SAID IT ALL THE SAME TO THE VIRGIN MARY HERSELF IF SHE HAD COME IN THE WAY OF HIS SYSTEM I USED SOMETIMES TO HEAR MY MOTHER REASONING CASES WITH HIMENDEAVORING TO EXCITE HIS SYMPATHIES HE WOULD LISTEN TO THE MOST PATHETIC APPEALS WITH THE MOST DISCOURAGING POLITENESS AND EQUANIMITY IT ALL RESOLVES ITSELF INTO THIS HE WOULD SAY MUST I PART WITH STUBBS OR KEEP HIM STUBBS IS THE SOUL OF PUNCTUALITY HONESTY AND EFFICIENCYA THOROUGH BUSINESS HAND AND AS HUMANE AS THE GENERAL RUN WE CANT HAVE PERFECTION AND IF I KEEP HIM I MUST SUSTAIN HIS ADMINISTRATION AS A WHOLE EVEN IF THERE ARE NOW AND THEN THINGS THAT ARE EXCEPTIONABLE ALL GOVERNMENT INCLUDES SOME NECESSARY HARDNESS GENERAL RULES WILL BEAR HARD ON PARTICULAR CASES THIS LAST MAXIM MY FATHER SEEMED TO CONSIDER A SETTLER IN MOST ALLEGED CASES OF CRUELTY AFTER HE HAD SAID THAT HE COMMONLY DREW UP HIS FEET ON THE SOFA LIKE A MAN THAT HAS DISPOSED OF A BUSINESS AND BETOOK HIMSELF TO A NAP OR THE NEWSPAPER AS THE CASE MIGHT BE THE FACT IS MY FATHER SHOWED THE EXACT SORT OF TALENT FOR A STATESMAN HE COULD HAVE DIVIDED POLAND AS EASILY AS AN ORANGE OR TROD ON IRELAND AS QUIETLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY AS ANY MAN LIVING AT LAST MY MOTHER GAVE UP IN DESPAIR IT NEVER WILL BE KNOWN TILL THE LAST ACCOUNT WHAT NOBLE AND SENSITIVE NATURES LIKE HERS HAVE FELT CAST UTTERLY HELPLESS INTO WHAT SEEMS TO THEM AN ABYSS OF INJUSTICE AND CRUELTY AND WHICH SEEMS SO TO NOBODY ABOUT THEM IT HAS BEEN AN AGE OF LONG SORROW OF SUCH NATURES IN SUCH A HELLBEGOTTEN SORT OF WORLD AS OURS WHAT REMAINED FOR HER BUT TO TRAIN HER CHILDREN IN HER OWN VIEWS AND SENTIMENTS WELL AFTER ALL YOU SAY ABOUT TRAINING CHILDREN WILL GROW UP SUBSTANTIALLY WHAT THEY ARE BY NATURE AND ONLY THAT FROM THE CRADLE ALFRED WAS AN ARISTOCRAT AND AS HE GREW UP INSTINCTIVELY ALL HIS SYMPATHIES AND ALL HIS REASONINGS WERE IN THAT LINE AND ALL MOTHERS EXHORTATIONS WENT TO THE WINDS AS TO ME THEY SUNK DEEP INTO ME SHE NEVER CONTRADICTED IN FORM ANYTHING MY FATHER SAID OR SEEMED DIRECTLY TO DIFFER FROM HIM BUT SHE IMPRESSED BURNT INTO MY VERY SOUL WITH ALL THE FORCE OF HER DEEP EARNEST NATURE AN IDEA OF THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF THE MEANEST HUMAN SOUL I HAVE LOOKED IN HER FACE WITH SOLEMN AWE WHEN SHE WOULD POINT UP TO THE STARS IN THE EVENING AND SAY TO ME SEE THERE AUGUSTE THE POOREST MEANEST SOUL ON OUR PLACE WILL BE LIVING WHEN ALL THESE STARS ARE GONE FOREVERWILL LIVE AS LONG AS GOD LIVES SHE HAD SOME FINE OLD PAINTINGS ONE IN PARTICULAR OF JESUS HEALING A BLIND MAN THEY WERE VERY FINE AND USED TO IMPRESS ME STRONGLY SEE THERE AUGUSTE SHE WOULD SAY THE BLIND MAN WAS A BEGGAR POOR AND LOATHSOME THEREFORE HE WOULD NOT HEAL HIM AFAR OFF HE CALLED HIM TO HIM AND PUT HIS HANDS ON HIM REMEMBER THIS MY BOY IF I HAD LIVED TO GROW UP UNDER HER CARE SHE MIGHT HAVE STIMULATED ME TO I KNOW NOT WHAT OF ENTHUSIASM I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SAINT REFORMER MARTYRBUT ALAS ALAS I WENT FROM HER WHEN I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN AND I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN ST CLARE RESTED HIS HEAD ON HIS HANDS AND DID NOT SPEAK FOR SOME MINUTES AFTER A WHILE HE LOOKED UP AND WENT ON WHAT POOR MEAN TRASH THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF HUMAN VIRTUE IS A MERE MATTER FOR THE MOST PART OF LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AND GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION ACTING WITH NATURAL TEMPERAMENT THE GREATER PART IS NOTHING BUT AN ACCIDENT YOUR FATHER FOR EXAMPLE SETTLES IN VERMONT IN A TOWN WHERE ALL ARE IN FACT FREE AND EQUAL BECOMES A REGULAR CHURCH MEMBER AND DEACON AND IN DUE TIME JOINS AN ABOLITION SOCIETY AND THINKS US ALL LITTLE BETTER THAN HEATHENS YET HE IS FOR ALL THE WORLD IN CONSTITUTION AND HABIT A DUPLICATE OF MY FATHER I CAN SEE IT LEAKING OUT IN FIFTY DIFFERENT WAYSJUST THE SAME STRONG OVERBEARING DOMINANT SPIRIT YOU KNOW VERY WELL HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS TO PERSUADE SOME OF THE FOLKS IN YOUR VILLAGE THAT SQUIRE SINCLAIR DOES NOT FEEL ABOVE THEM THE FACT IS THOUGH HE HAS FALLEN ON DEMOCRATIC TIMES AND EMBRACED A DEMOCRATIC THEORY HE IS TO THE HEART AN ARISTOCRAT AS MUCH AS MY FATHER WHO RULED OVER FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED SLAVES MISS OPHELIA FELT RATHER DISPOSED TO CAVIL AT THIS PICTURE AND WAS LAYING DOWN HER KNITTING TO BEGIN BUT ST CLARE STOPPED HER NOW I KNOW EVERY WORD YOU ARE GOING TO SAY I DO NOT SAY THEY WERE ALIKE IN FACT ONE FELL INTO A CONDITION WHERE EVERYTHING ACTED AGAINST THE NATURAL TENDENCY AND THE OTHER WHERE EVERYTHING ACTED FOR IT AND SO ONE TURNED OUT A PRETTY WILFUL STOUT OVERBEARING OLD DEMOCRAT AND THE OTHER A WILFUL STOUT OLD DESPOT IF BOTH HAD OWNED PLANTATIONS IN LOUISIANA THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN AS LIKE AS TWO OLD BULLETS CAST IN THE SAME MOULD WHAT AN UNDUTIFUL BOY YOU ARE SAID MISS OPHELIA I DONT MEAN THEM ANY DISRESPECT SAID ST CLARE YOU KNOW REVERENCE IS NOT MY FORTE BUT TO GO BACK TO MY HISTORY WHEN FATHER DIED HE LEFT THE WHOLE PROPERTY TO US TWIN BOYS TO BE DIVIDED AS WE SHOULD AGREE THERE DOES NOT BREATHE ON GODS EARTH A NOBLERSOULED MORE GENEROUS FELLOW THAN ALFRED IN ALL THAT CONCERNS HIS EQUALS AND WE GOT ON ADMIRABLY WITH THIS PROPERTY QUESTION WITHOUT A SINGLE UNBROTHERLY WORD OR FEELING WE UNDERTOOK TO WORK THE PLANTATION TOGETHER AND ALFRED WHOSE OUTWARD LIFE AND CAPABILITIES HAD DOUBLE THE STRENGTH OF MINE BECAME AN ENTHUSIASTIC PLANTER AND A WONDERFULLY SUCCESSFUL ONE BUT TWO YEARS TRIAL SATISFIED ME THAT I COULD NOT BE A PARTNER IN THAT MATTER TO HAVE A GREAT GANG OF SEVEN HUNDRED WHOM I COULD NOT KNOW PERSONALLY OR FEEL ANY INDIVIDUAL INTEREST IN BOUGHT AND DRIVEN HOUSED FED WORKED LIKE SO MANY HORNED CATTLE STRAINED UP TO MILITARY PRECISIONTHE QUESTION OF HOW LITTLE OF LIFES COMMONEST ENJOYMENTS WOULD KEEP THEM IN WORKING ORDER BEING A CONSTANTLY RECURRING PROBLEMTHE NECESSITY OF DRIVERS AND OVERSEERSTHE EVERNECESSARY WHIP FIRST LAST AND ONLY ARGUMENTTHE WHOLE THING WAS INSUFFERABLY DISGUSTING AND LOATHSOME TO ME AND WHEN I THOUGHT OF MY MOTHERS ESTIMATE OF ONE POOR HUMAN SOUL IT BECAME EVEN FRIGHTFUL ITS ALL NONSENSE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT SLAVES ENJOYING ALL THIS TO THIS DAY I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH THE UNUTTERABLE TRASH THAT SOME OF YOUR PATRONIZING NORTHERNERS HAVE MADE UP AS IN THEIR ZEAL TO APOLOGIZE FOR OUR SINS WE ALL KNOW BETTER TELL ME THAT ANY MAN LIVING WANTS TO WORK ALL HIS DAYS FROM DAYDAWN TILL DARK UNDER THE CONSTANT EYE OF A MASTER WITHOUT THE POWER OF PUTTING FORTH ONE IRRESPONSIBLE VOLITION ON THE SAME DREARY MONOTONOUS UNCHANGING TOIL AND ALL FOR TWO PAIRS OF PANTALOONS AND A PAIR OF SHOES A YEAR WITH ENOUGH FOOD AND SHELTER TO KEEP HIM IN WORKING ORDER ANY MAN WHO THINKS THAT HUMAN BEINGS CAN AS A GENERAL THING BE MADE ABOUT AS COMFORTABLE THAT WAY AS ANY OTHER I WISH HE MIGHT TRY IT ID BUY THE DOG AND WORK HIM WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE I ALWAYS HAVE SUPPOSED SAID MISS OPHELIA THAT YOU ALL OF YOU APPROVED OF THESE THINGS AND THOUGHT THEM RIGHTACCORDING TO SCRIPTURE HUMBUG WE ARE NOT QUITE REDUCED TO THAT YET ALFRED WHO IS AS DETERMINED A DESPOT AS EVER WALKED DOES NOT PRETEND TO THIS KIND OF DEFENCENO HE STANDS HIGH AND HAUGHTY ON THAT GOOD OLD RESPECTABLE GROUND THE RIGHT OF THE STRONGEST AND HE SAYS AND I THINK QUITE SENSIBLY THAT THE AMERICAN PLANTER IS ONLY DOING IN ANOTHER FORM WHAT THE ENGLISH ARISTOCRACY AND CAPITALISTS ARE DOING BY THE LOWER CLASSES THAT IS I TAKE IT APPROPRIATING THEM BODY AND BONE SOUL AND SPIRIT TO THEIR USE AND CONVENIENCE HE DEFENDS BOTHAND I THINK AT LEAST CONSISTENTLY HE SAYS THAT THERE CAN BE NO HIGH CIVILIZATION WITHOUT ENSLAVEMENT OF THE MASSES EITHER NOMINAL OR REAL THERE MUST HE SAYS BE A LOWER CLASS GIVEN UP TO PHYSICAL TOIL AND CONFINED TO AN ANIMAL NATURE AND A HIGHER ONE THEREBY ACQUIRES LEISURE AND WEALTH FOR A MORE EXPANDED INTELLIGENCE AND IMPROVEMENT AND BECOMES THE DIRECTING SOUL OF THE LOWER SO HE REASONS BECAUSE AS I SAID HE IS BORN AN ARISTOCRATSO I DONT BELIEVE BECAUSE I WAS BORN A DEMOCRAT HOW IN THE WORLD CAN THE TWO THINGS BE COMPARED SAID MISS OPHELIA THE ENGLISH LABORER IS NOT SOLD TRADED PARTED FROM HIS FAMILY WHIPPED HE IS AS MUCH AT THE WILL OF HIS EMPLOYER AS IF HE WERE SOLD TO HIM THE SLAVEOWNER CAN WHIP HIS REFRACTORY SLAVE TO DEATHTHE CAPITALIST CAN STARVE HIM TO DEATH AS TO FAMILY SECURITY IT IS HARD TO SAY WHICH IS THE WORSTTO HAVE ONES CHILDREN SOLD OR SEE THEM STARVE TO DEATH AT HOME BUT ITS NO KIND OF APOLOGY FOR SLAVERY TO PROVE THAT IT ISNT WORSE THAN SOME OTHER BAD THING I DIDNT GIVE IT FOR ONENAY ILL SAY BESIDES THAT OURS IS THE MORE BOLD AND PALPABLE INFRINGEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTUALLY BUYING A MAN UP LIKE A HORSELOOKING AT HIS TEETH CRACKING HIS JOINTS AND TRYING HIS PACES AND THEN PAYING DOWN FOR HIMHAVING SPECULATORS BREEDERS TRADERS AND BROKERS IN HUMAN BODIES AND SOULSSETS THE THING BEFORE THE EYES OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD IN A MORE TANGIBLE FORM THOUGH THE THING DONE BE AFTER ALL IN ITS NATURE THE SAME THAT IS APPROPRIATING ONE SET OF HUMAN BEINGS TO THE USE AND IMPROVEMENT OF ANOTHER WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO THEIR OWN I NEVER THOUGHT OF THE MATTER IN THIS LIGHT SAID MISS OPHELIA WELL IVE TRAVELLED IN ENGLAND SOME AND IVE LOOKED OVER A GOOD MANY DOCUMENTS AS TO THE STATE OF THEIR LOWER CLASSES AND I REALLY THINK THERE IS NO DENYING ALFRED WHEN HE SAYS THAT HIS SLAVES ARE BETTER OFF THAN A LARGE CLASS OF THE POPULATION OF ENGLAND YOU SEE YOU MUST NOT INFER FROM WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT ALFRED IS WHAT IS CALLED A HARD MASTER FOR HE ISNT HE IS DESPOTIC AND UNMERCIFUL TO INSUBORDINATION HE WOULD SHOOT A FELLOW DOWN WITH AS LITTLE REMORSE AS HE WOULD SHOOT A BUCK IF HE OPPOSED HIM BUT IN GENERAL HE TAKES A SORT OF PRIDE IN HAVING HIS SLAVES COMFORTABLY FED AND ACCOMMODATED WHEN I WAS WITH HIM I INSISTED THAT HE SHOULD DO SOMETHING FOR THEIR INSTRUCTION AND TO PLEASE ME HE DID GET A CHAPLAIN AND USED TO HAVE THEM CATECHIZED SUNDAY THOUGH I BELIEVE IN HIS HEART THAT HE THOUGHT IT WOULD DO ABOUT AS MUCH GOOD TO SET A CHAPLAIN OVER HIS DOGS AND HORSES AND THE FACT IS THAT A MIND STUPEFIED AND ANIMALIZED BY EVERY BAD INFLUENCE FROM THE HOUR OF BIRTH SPENDING THE WHOLE OF EVERY WEEKDAY IN UNREFLECTING TOIL CANNOT BE DONE MUCH WITH BY A FEW HOURS ON SUNDAY THE TEACHERS OF SUNDAYSCHOOLS AMONG THE MANUFACTURING POPULATION OF ENGLAND AND AMONG PLANTATIONHANDS IN OUR COUNTRY COULD PERHAPS TESTIFY TO THE SAME RESULT THERE AND HERE YET SOME STRIKING EXCEPTIONS THERE ARE AMONG US FROM THE FACT THAT THE NEGRO IS NATURALLY MORE IMPRESSIBLE TO RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT THAN THE WHITE WELL SAID MISS OPHELIA HOW CAME YOU TO GIVE UP YOUR PLANTATION LIFE WELL WE JOGGED ON TOGETHER SOME TIME TILL ALFRED SAW PLAINLY THAT I WAS NO PLANTER HE THOUGHT IT ABSURD AFTER HE HAD REFORMED AND ALTERED AND IMPROVED EVERYWHERE TO SUIT MY NOTIONS THAT I STILL REMAINED UNSATISFIED THE FACT WAS IT WAS AFTER ALL THE THING THAT I HATEDTHE USING THESE MEN AND WOMEN THE PERPETUATION OF ALL THIS IGNORANCE BRUTALITY AND VICEJUST TO MAKE MONEY FOR ME BESIDES I WAS ALWAYS INTERFERING IN THE DETAILS BEING MYSELF ONE OF THE LAZIEST OF MORTALS I HAD ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH FELLOWFEELING FOR THE LAZY AND WHEN POOR SHIFTLESS DOGS PUT STONES AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR COTTONBASKETS TO MAKE THEM WEIGH HEAVIER OR FILLED THEIR SACKS WITH DIRT WITH COTTON AT THE TOP IT SEEMED SO EXACTLY LIKE WHAT I SHOULD DO IF I WERE THEY I COULDNT AND WOULDNT HAVE THEM FLOGGED FOR IT WELL OF COURSE THERE WAS AN END OF PLANTATION DISCIPLINE AND ALF AND I CAME TO ABOUT THE SAME POINT THAT I AND MY RESPECTED FATHER DID YEARS BEFORE SO HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS A WOMANISH SENTIMENTALIST AND WOULD NEVER DO FOR BUSINESS LIFE AND ADVISED ME TO TAKE THE BANKSTOCK AND THE NEW ORLEANS FAMILY MANSION AND GO TO WRITING POETRY AND LET HIM MANAGE THE PLANTATION SO WE PARTED AND I CAME HERE BUT WHY DIDNT YOU FREE YOUR SLAVES WELL I WASNT UP TO THAT TO HOLD THEM AS TOOLS FOR MONEYMAKING I COULD NOTHAVE THEM TO HELP SPEND MONEY YOU KNOW DIDNT LOOK QUITE SO UGLY TO ME SOME OF THEM WERE OLD HOUSESERVANTS TO WHOM I WAS MUCH ATTACHED AND THE YOUNGER ONES WERE CHILDREN TO THE OLD ALL WERE WELL SATISFIED TO BE AS THEY WERE HE PAUSED AND WALKED REFLECTIVELY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM THERE WAS SAID ST CLARE A TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN I HAD PLANS AND HOPES OF DOING SOMETHING IN THIS WORLD MORE THAN TO FLOAT AND DRIFT I HAD VAGUE INDISTINCT YEARNINGS TO BE A SORT OF EMANCIPATORTO FREE MY NATIVE LAND FROM THIS SPOT AND STAIN ALL YOUNG MEN HAVE HAD SUCH FEVERFITS I SUPPOSE SOME TIMEBUT THEN WHY DIDNT YOU SAID MISS OPHELIAYOU OUGHT NOT TO PUT YOUR HAND TO THE PLOUGH AND LOOK BACK O WELL THINGS DIDNT GO WITH ME AS I EXPECTED AND I GOT THE DESPAIR OF LIVING THAT SOLOMON DID I SUPPOSE IT WAS A NECESSARY INCIDENT TO WISDOM IN US BOTH BUT SOME HOW OR OTHER INSTEAD OF BEING ACTOR AND REGENERATOR IN SOCIETY I BECAME A PIECE OF DRIFTWOOD AND HAVE BEEN FLOATING AND EDDYING ABOUT EVER SINCE ALFRED SCOLDS ME EVERY TIME WE MEET AND HE HAS THE BETTER OF ME I GRANTFOR HE REALLY DOES SOMETHING HIS LIFE IS A LOGICAL RESULT OF HIS OPINIONS AND MINE IS A CONTEMPTIBLE NON SEQUITUR MY DEAR COUSIN CAN YOU BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH A WAY OF SPENDING YOUR PROBATION SATISFIED WAS I NOT JUST TELLING YOU I DESPISED IT BUT THEN TO COME BACK TO THIS POINTWE WERE ON THIS LIBERATION BUSINESS I DONT THINK MY FEELINGS ABOUT SLAVERY ARE PECULIAR I FIND MANY MEN WHO IN THEIR HEARTS THINK OF IT JUST AS I DO THE LAND GROANS UNDER IT AND BAD AS IT IS FOR THE SLAVE IT IS WORSE IF ANYTHING FOR THE MASTER IT TAKES NO SPECTACLES TO SEE THAT A GREAT CLASS OF VICIOUS IMPROVIDENT DEGRADED PEOPLE AMONG US ARE AN EVIL TO US AS WELL AS TO THEMSELVES THE CAPITALIST AND ARISTOCRAT OF ENGLAND CANNOT FEEL THAT AS WE DO BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MINGLE WITH THE CLASS THEY DEGRADE AS WE DO THEY ARE IN OUR HOMES THEY ARE THE ASSOCIATES OF OUR CHILDREN AND THEY FORM THEIR MINDS FASTER THAN WE CAN FOR THEY ARE A RACE THAT CHILDREN ALWAYS WILL CLING TO AND ASSIMILATE WITH IF EVA NOW WAS NOT MORE ANGEL THAN ORDINARY SHE WOULD BE RUINED WE MIGHT AS WELL ALLOW THE SMALLPOX TO RUN AMONG THEM AND THINK OUR CHILDREN WOULD NOT TAKE IT AS TO LET THEM BE UNINSTRUCTED AND VICIOUS AND THINK OUR CHILDREN WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THAT YET OUR LAWS POSITIVELY AND UTTERLY FORBID ANY EFFICIENT GENERAL EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND THEY DO IT WISELY TOO FOR JUST BEGIN AND THOROUGHLY EDUCATE ONE GENERATION AND THE WHOLE THING WOULD BE BLOWN SKY HIGH IF WE DID NOT GIVE THEM LIBERTY THEY WOULD TAKE IT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE END OF THIS SAID MISS OPHELIA I DONT KNOW ONE THING IS CERTAINTHAT THERE IS A MUSTERING AMONG THE MASSES THE WORLD OVER AND THERE IS A DIES IR COMING ON SOONER OR LATER THE SAME THING IS WORKING IN EUROPE IN ENGLAND AND IN THIS COUNTRY MY MOTHER USED TO TELL ME OF A MILLENNIUM THAT WAS COMING WHEN CHRIST SHOULD REIGN AND ALL MEN SHOULD BE FREE AND HAPPY AND SHE TAUGHT ME WHEN I WAS A BOY TO PRAY THY KINGDOM COME SOMETIMES I THINK ALL THIS SIGHING AND GROANING AND STIRRING AMONG THE DRY BONES FORETELLS WHAT SHE USED TO TELL ME WAS COMING BUT WHO MAY ABIDE THE DAY OF HIS APPEARING AUGUSTINE SOMETIMES I THINK YOU ARE NOT FAR FROM THE KINGDOM SAID MISS OPHELIA LAYING DOWN HER KNITTING AND LOOKING ANXIOUSLY AT HER COUSIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD OPINION BUT ITS UP AND DOWN WITH MEUP TO HEAVENS GATE IN THEORY DOWN IN EARTHS DUST IN PRACTICE BUT THERES THE TEABELLDO LETS GOAND DONT SAY NOW I HAVENT HAD ONE DOWNRIGHT SERIOUS TALK FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE AT TABLE MARIE ALLUDED TO THE INCIDENT OF PRUE I SUPPOSE YOULL THINK COUSIN SHE SAID THAT WE ARE ALL BARBARIANS I THINK THATS A BARBAROUS THING SAID MISS OPHELIA BUT I DONT THINK YOU ARE ALL BARBARIANS WELL NOW SAID MARIE I KNOW ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ALONG WITH SOME OF THESE CREATURES THEY ARE SO BAD THEY OUGHT NOT TO LIVE I DONT FEEL A PARTICLE OF SYMPATHY FOR SUCH CASES IF THEYD ONLY BEHAVE THEMSELVES IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN BUT MAMMA SAID EVA THE POOR CREATURE WAS UNHAPPY THATS WHAT MADE HER DRINK O FIDDLESTICK AS IF THAT WERE ANY EXCUSE IM UNHAPPY VERY OFTEN I PRESUME SHE SAID PENSIVELY THAT IVE HAD GREATER TRIALS THAN EVER SHE HAD ITS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE SO BAD THERES SOME OF THEM THAT YOU CANNOT BREAK IN BY ANY KIND OF SEVERITY I REMEMBER FATHER HAD A MAN THAT WAS SO LAZY HE WOULD RUN AWAY JUST TO GET RID OF WORK AND LIE ROUND IN THE SWAMPS STEALING AND DOING ALL SORTS OF HORRID THINGS THAT MAN WAS CAUGHT AND WHIPPED TIME AND AGAIN AND IT NEVER DID HIM ANY GOOD AND THE LAST TIME HE CRAWLED OFF THOUGH HE COULDNT BUT JUST GO AND DIED IN THE SWAMP THERE WAS NO SORT OF REASON FOR IT FOR FATHERS HANDS WERE ALWAYS TREATED KINDLY I BROKE A FELLOW IN ONCE SAID ST CLARE THAT ALL THE OVERSEERS AND MASTERS HAD TRIED THEIR HANDS ON IN VAIN YOU SAID MARIE WELL ID BE GLAD TO KNOW WHEN YOU EVER DID ANYTHING OF THE SORT WELL HE WAS A POWERFUL GIGANTIC FELLOWA NATIVEBORN AFRICAN AND HE APPEARED TO HAVE THE RUDE INSTINCT OF FREEDOM IN HIM TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE HE WAS A REGULAR AFRICAN LION THEY CALLED HIM SCIPIO NOBODY COULD DO ANYTHING WITH HIM AND HE WAS SOLD ROUND FROM OVERSEER TO OVERSEER TILL AT LAST ALFRED BOUGHT HIM BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE COULD MANAGE HIM WELL ONE DAY HE KNOCKED DOWN THE OVERSEER AND WAS FAIRLY OFF INTO THE SWAMPS I WAS ON A VISIT TO ALFS PLANTATION FOR IT WAS AFTER WE HAD DISSOLVED PARTNERSHIP ALFRED WAS GREATLY EXASPERATED BUT I TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS HIS OWN FAULT AND LAID HIM ANY WAGER THAT I COULD BREAK THE MAN AND FINALLY IT WAS AGREED THAT IF I CAUGHT HIM I SHOULD HAVE HIM TO EXPERIMENT ON SO THEY MUSTERED OUT A PARTY OF SOME SIX OR SEVEN WITH GUNS AND DOGS FOR THE HUNT PEOPLE YOU KNOW CAN GET UP AS MUCH ENTHUSIASM IN HUNTING A MAN AS A DEER IF IT IS ONLY CUSTOMARY IN FACT I GOT A LITTLE EXCITED MYSELF THOUGH I HAD ONLY PUT IN AS A SORT OF MEDIATOR IN CASE HE WAS CAUGHT WELL THE DOGS BAYED AND HOWLED AND WE RODE AND SCAMPERED AND FINALLY WE STARTED HIM HE RAN AND BOUNDED LIKE A BUCK AND KEPT US WELL IN THE REAR FOR SOME TIME BUT AT LAST HE GOT CAUGHT IN AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OF CANE THEN HE TURNED TO BAY AND I TELL YOU HE FOUGHT THE DOGS RIGHT GALLANTLY HE DASHED THEM TO RIGHT AND LEFT AND ACTUALLY KILLED THREE OF THEM WITH ONLY HIS NAKED FISTS WHEN A SHOT FROM A GUN BROUGHT HIM DOWN AND HE FELL WOUNDED AND BLEEDING ALMOST AT MY FEET THE POOR FELLOW LOOKED UP AT ME WITH MANHOOD AND DESPAIR BOTH IN HIS EYE I KEPT BACK THE DOGS AND THE PARTY AS THEY CAME PRESSING UP AND CLAIMED HIM AS MY PRISONER IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO KEEP THEM FROM SHOOTING HIM IN THE FLUSH OF SUCCESS BUT I PERSISTED IN MY BARGAIN AND ALFRED SOLD HIM TO ME WELL I TOOK HIM IN HAND AND IN ONE FORTNIGHT I HAD HIM TAMED DOWN AS SUBMISSIVE AND TRACTABLE AS HEART

A DECENT ROOM CONTAINING A BED A CHAIR AND A SMALL ROUGH STAND WHERE LAY TOMS BIBLE AND HYMNBOOK AND WHERE HE SITS AT PRESENT WITH HIS SLATE BEFORE HIM INTENT ON SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO COST HIM A GREAT DEAL OF ANXIOUS THOUGHT THE FACT WAS THAT TOMS HOMEYEARNINGS HAD BECOME SO STRONG THAT HE HAD BEGGED A SHEET OF WRITINGPAPER OF EVA AND MUSTERING UP ALL HIS SMALL STOCK OF LITERARY ATTAINMENT ACQUIRED BY MASR GEORGES INSTRUCTIONS HE CONCEIVED THE BOLD IDEA OF WRITING A LETTER AND HE WAS BUSY NOW ON HIS SLATE GETTING OUT HIS FIRST DRAFT TOM WAS IN A GOOD DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THE FORMS OF

INCESSANT AS TO LAY SOME FOUNDATION FOR THE COMPLAINT SHE SEWED AND STITCHED AWAY FROM DAYLIGHT TILL DARK WITH THE ENERGY OF ONE WHO IS PRESSED ON BY SOME IMMEDIATE URGENCY AND THEN WHEN THE LIGHT FADED AND THE WORK WAS FOLDED AWAY WITH ONE TURN OUT CAME THE EVERREADY KNITTINGWORK AND THERE SHE WAS AGAIN GOING ON AS BRISKLY AS EVER IT REALLY WAS A LABOR TO SEE HER CHAPTER XX TOPSY ONE MORNING

OF THE NEW MASRS PARLOR DISPLAYED A WHITE AND BRILLIANT SET OF TEETH HER WOOLLY HAIR WAS BRAIDED IN SUNDRY LITTLE TAILS WHICH STUCK OUT IN EVERY DIRECTION THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE WAS AN ODD MIXTURE OF SHREWDNESS AND CUNNING OVER WHICH WAS ODDLY DRAWN LIKE A KIND OF VEIL AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST DOLEFUL GRAVITY AND SOLEMNITY SHE WAS DRESSED IN A SINGLE FILTHY RAGGED GARMENT MADE OF BAGGING AND STOOD WITH HER HANDS DEMURELY FOLDED BEFORE HER ALTOGETHER THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD AND GOBLINLIKE ABOUT HER APPEARANCESOMETHING AS MISS OPHELIA AFTERWARDS SAID SO HEATHENISH AS TO INSPIRE THAT GOOD

KNOCKING HER KNEES TOGETHER IN A WILD FANTASTIC SORT OF TIME AND PRODUCING IN HER THROAT ALL THOSE ODD GUTTURAL SOUNDS WHICH DISTINGUISH THE NATIVE MUSIC OF HER RACE AND FINALLY TURNING A SUMMERSET OR TWO AND GIVING A PROLONGED CLOSING NOTE AS ODD AND UNEARTHLY AS THAT OF A STEAMWHISTLE SHE CAME SUDDENLY DOWN ON THE CARPET AND STOOD WITH HER HANDS FOLDED AND A MOST SANCTIMONIOUS EXPRESSION OF

LOOKING AT TOPSY THERE STOOD THE TWO CHILDREN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TWO EXTREMES OF SOCIETY THE FAIR HIGHBRED CHILD WITH HER GOLDEN HEAD HER DEEP EYES HER SPIRITUAL NOBLE BROW AND PRINCELIKE MOVEMENTS AND HER BLACK KEEN SUBTLE CRINGING YET ACUTE NEIGHBOR THEY STOOD THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THEIR RACES THE SAXON BORN OF AGES OF CULTIVATION COMMAND EDUCATION PHYSICAL AND MORAL EMINENCE THE AFRIC BORN OF AGES OF OPPRESSION SUBMISSION IGNORANCE TOIL AND VICE SOMETHING PERHAPS OF SUCH THOUGHTS STRUGGLED THROUGH EVAS MIND BUT A CHILDS THOUGHTS ARE RATHER DIM UNDEFINED INSTINCTS AND IN EVAS NOBLE NATURE MANY SUCH WERE YEARNING AND WORKING FOR WHICH SHE HAD NO POWER OF UTTERANCE WHEN MISS OPHELIA EXPATIATED ON TOPSYS NAUGHTY WICKED CONDUCT THE CHILD LOOKED PERPLEXED AND SORROWFUL BUT SAID SWEETLY POOR TOPSY WHY NEED YOU STEAL YOURE GOING TO BE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF NOW IM SURE ID RATHER GIVE YOU ANYTHING OF MINE THAN HAVE YOU STEAL IT IT WAS THE FIRST WORD OF KINDNESS THE CHILD HAD EVER HEARD IN HER LIFE AND THE SWEET TONE AND MANNER STRUCK STRANGELY ON THE WILD RUDE HEART AND A SPARKLE OF SOMETHING LIKE A TEAR SHONE IN THE KEEN ROUND GLITTERING EYE BUT IT WAS FOLLOWED BY THE SHORT LAUGH AND HABITUAL GRIN NO THE EAR THAT HAS NEVER HEARD ANYTHING BUT ABUSE IS STRANGELY INCREDULOUS OF ANYTHING SO HEAVENLY AS KINDNESS AND TOPSY ONLY THOUGHT EVAS SPEECH SOMETHING FUNNY AND INEXPLICABLESHE DID NOT BELIEVE IT BUT WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WITH TOPSY MISS OPHELIA FOUND THE CASE A PUZZLER HER RULES FOR BRINGING UP DIDNT SEEM TO APPLY SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD TAKE TIME TO THINK OF IT AND BY THE WAY OF GAINING TIME AND IN HOPES OF SOME INDEFINITE MORAL VIRTUES SUPPOSED TO BE INHERENT IN DARK CLOSETS MISS OPHELIA SHUT TOPSY UP IN ONE TILL SHE HAD ARRANGED HER IDEAS FURTHER ON THE

A POKER KNOCKED DOWN WITH THE SHOVEL OR TONGS WHICHEVER CAME HANDIEST C AND SEEING THAT SHE IS USED TO THAT STYLE OF OPERATION I THINK YOUR WHIPPINGS WILL HAVE TO BE PRETTY ENERGETIC TO MAKE MUCH IMPRESSION WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH HER THEN SAID MISS OPHELIA YOU HAVE STARTED A SERIOUS QUESTION SAID ST CLARE I WISH YOUD ANSWER IT WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH A HUMAN BEING THAT CAN BE GOVERNED ONLY BY THE LASHTHAT FAILSITS A VERY COMMON STATE OF THINGS DOWN HERE IM SURE I DONT KNOW I NEVER SAW SUCH A CHILD AS THIS SUCH CHILDREN ARE VERY COMMON AMONG US AND SUCH MEN AND WOMEN TOO HOW ARE THEY TO BE GOVERNED SAID ST CLARE IM SURE ITS MORE THAN I CAN SAY SAID MISS OPHELIA OR I EITHER SAID ST CLARE THE HORRID CRUELTIES AND OUTRAGES THAT ONCE AND A WHILE FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE PAPERSSUCH CASES AS PRUES FOR EXAMPLEWHAT DO THEY COME FROM IN MANY CASES IT IS A GRADUAL HARDENING PROCESS ON BOTH SIDESTHE OWNER GROWING MORE AND MORE CRUEL AS THE SERVANT MORE AND MORE CALLOUS WHIPPING AND ABUSE ARE LIKE LAUDANUM YOU HAVE TO DOUBLE THE DOSE AS THE SENSIBILITIES DECLINE I SAW THIS VERY EARLY WHEN I BECAME AN OWNER AND I RESOLVED NEVER TO BEGIN BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW WHEN I SHOULD STOPAND I RESOLVED AT LEAST TO PROTECT MY OWN MORAL NATURE THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT MY SERVANTS ACT LIKE SPOILED CHILDREN BUT I THINK THAT BETTER THAN FOR US BOTH TO BE BRUTALIZED TOGETHER YOU HAVE TALKED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES IN EDUCATING COUSIN I REALLY WANTED YOU TO TRY WITH ONE CHILD WHO IS A SPECIMEN OF THOUSANDS AMONG US IT IS YOUR SYSTEM MAKES SUCH CHILDREN SAID MISS OPHELIA I KNOW IT BUT THEY ARE MADETHEY EXISTAND WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THEM WELL I CANT SAY I THANK YOU FOR THE EXPERIMENT BUT THEN AS IT APPEARS TO BE A DUTY I SHALL PERSEVERE AND TRY AND DO THE BEST I CAN SAID MISS OPHELIA AND MISS OPHELIA AFTER THIS DID LABOR WITH A COMMENDABLE DEGREE OF ZEAL AND ENERGY ON HER NEW SUBJECT SHE INSTITUTED REGULAR HOURS AND EMPLOYMENTS FOR HER AND UNDERTOOK TO TEACH HER TO READ AND SEW IN THE FORMER ART THE CHILD WAS QUICK ENOUGH SHE LEARNED HER LETTERS AS IF BY MAGIC AND WAS VERY SOON ABLE TO READ PLAIN READING BUT THE SEWING WAS A MORE DIFFICULT MATTER THE CREATURE WAS AS LITHE AS A CAT AND AS ACTIVE AS A MONKEY AND THE CONFINEMENT OF SEWING WAS HER ABOMINATION SO SHE BROKE HER NEEDLES THREW THEM SLYLY OUT OF THE WINDOW OR DOWN IN CHINKS OF THE WALLS SHE TANGLED BROKE AND DIRTIED HER THREAD OR WITH A SLY MOVEMENT WOULD THROW A SPOOL AWAY ALTOGETHER HER MOTIONS WERE ALMOST AS QUICK AS THOSE OF A PRACTISED CONJURER AND HER COMMAND OF HER FACE QUITE AS GREAT AND THOUGH MISS OPHELIA COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT SO MANY ACCIDENTS COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAPPEN IN SUCCESSION YET SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT A WATCHFULNESS WHICH WOULD LEAVE HER NO TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE DETECT HER TOPSY WAS SOON A NOTED CHARACTER IN THE ESTABLISHMENT HER TALENT FOR EVERY SPECIES OF DROLLERY GRIMACE AND MIMICRYFOR DANCING TUMBLING CLIMBING SINGING WHISTLING IMITATING EVERY SOUND THAT HIT HER FANCYSEEMED INEXHAUSTIBLE IN HER PLAYHOURS SHE INVARIABLY HAD EVERY CHILD IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AT HER HEELS OPENMOUTHED WITH ADMIRATION AND WONDERNOT EXCEPTING MISS EVA WHO APPEARED TO BE FASCINATED BY HER WILD DIABLERIE AS A DOVE IS SOMETIMES CHARMED BY A GLITTERING SERPENT MISS OPHELIA WAS UNEASY THAT EVA SHOULD FANCY TOPSYS SOCIETY SO MUCH AND IMPLORED ST CLARE TO FORBID IT POH LET THE CHILD ALONE SAID ST CLARE TOPSY WILL DO HER GOOD BUT SO DEPRAVED A CHILDARE YOU NOT AFRAID SHE WILL TEACH HER SOME MISCHIEF SHE CANT TEACH HER MISCHIEF SHE MIGHT TEACH IT TO SOME CHILDREN BUT EVIL ROLLS OFF EVAS MIND LIKE DEW OFF A CABBAGELEAFNOT A DROP SINKS IN DONT BE TOO SURE SAID MISS OPHELIA I KNOW ID NEVER LET A CHILD OF MINE PLAY WITH TOPSY WELL YOUR CHILDREN NEEDNT SAID ST CLARE BUT MINE MAY IF EVA COULD HAVE BEEN SPOILED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE YEARS AGO TOPSY WAS AT FIRST DESPISED AND CONTEMNED BY THE UPPER SERVANTS THEY SOON FOUND REASON TO ALTER THEIR OPINION IT WAS VERY SOON DISCOVERED THAT WHOEVER CAST AN INDIGNITY ON TOPSY WAS SURE TO MEET WITH SOME INCONVENIENT ACCIDENT SHORTLY AFTEREITHER A PAIR OF EARRINGS OR SOME CHERISHED TRINKET WOULD BE MISSING OR AN ARTICLE OF DRESS WOULD BE SUDDENLY FOUND UTTERLY RUINED OR THE PERSON WOULD STUMBLE ACCIDENTLY INTO A PAIL OF HOT WATER OR A LIBATION OF DIRTY SLOP WOULD UNACCOUNTABLY DELUGE THEM FROM ABOVE WHEN IN FULL GALA DRESSAND ON ALL THESE OCCASIONS WHEN INVESTIGATION WAS MADE THERE WAS NOBODY FOUND TO STAND SPONSOR FOR THE INDIGNITY TOPSY WAS CITED AND HAD UP BEFORE ALL THE DOMESTIC JUDICATORIES TIME AND AGAIN BUT ALWAYS SUSTAINED HER EXAMINATIONS WITH MOST EDIFYING INNOCENCE AND GRAVITY OF APPEARANCE NOBODY IN THE WORLD EVER DOUBTED WHO DID THE THINGS BUT NOT A SCRAP OF ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE COULD BE FOUND TO ESTABLISH THE SUPPOSITIONS AND MISS OPHELIA WAS TOO JUST TO FEEL AT LIBERTY TO PROCEED TO ANY LENGTH WITHOUT IT THE MISCHIEFS DONE WERE ALWAYS SO NICELY TIMED ALSO AS FURTHER TO SHELTER THE AGGRESSOR THUS THE TIMES FOR REVENGE ON ROSA AND JANE THE TWO CHAMBER MAIDS WERE ALWAYS CHOSEN IN THOSE SEASONS WHEN AS NOT UNFREQUENTLY HAPPENED THEY WERE IN DISGRACE WITH THEIR MISTRESS WHEN ANY COMPLAINT FROM THEM WOULD OF COURSE MEET WITH NO SYMPATHY IN SHORT TOPSY SOON MADE THE HOUSEHOLD UNDERSTAND THE PROPRIETY OF LETTING HER ALONE AND SHE WAS LET ALONE ACCORDINGLY TOPSY WAS SMART AND ENERGETIC IN ALL MANUAL OPERATIONS LEARNING EVERYTHING THAT WAS TAUGHT HER WITH SURPRISING QUICKNESS WITH A FEW LESSONS SHE HAD LEARNED TO DO THE PROPRIETIES OF MISS OPHELIAS CHAMBER IN A WAY WITH WHICH EVEN THAT PARTICULAR LADY COULD FIND NO FAULT MORTAL HANDS COULD NOT LAY SPREAD SMOOTHER ADJUST PILLOWS MORE ACCURATELY SWEEP AND DUST AND ARRANGE MORE PERFECTLY THAN TOPSY WHEN SHE CHOSEBUT SHE DIDNT VERY OFTEN CHOOSE IF MISS OPHELIA AFTER THREE OR FOUR DAYS OF CAREFUL PATIENT SUPERVISION WAS SO SANGUINE AS TO SUPPOSE THAT TOPSY HAD AT LAST FALLEN INTO HER WAY COULD DO WITHOUT OVERLOOKING AND SO GO OFF AND BUSY HERSELF ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE TOPSY WOULD HOLD A PERFECT CARNIVAL OF CONFUSION FOR SOME ONE OR TWO HOURS INSTEAD OF MAKING THE BED SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF WITH PULLING OFF THE PILLOWCASES BUTTING HER WOOLLY HEAD AMONG THE PILLOWS TILL IT WOULD SOMETIMES BE GROTESQUELY ORNAMENTED WITH FEATHERS STICKING OUT IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS SHE WOULD CLIMB THE POSTS AND HANG HEAD DOWNWARD FROM THE TOPS FLOURISH THE SHEETS AND SPREADS ALL OVER THE APARTMENT DRESS THE BOLSTER UP IN MISS OPHELIAS NIGHTCLOTHES AND ENACT VARIOUS PERFORMANCES WITH THATSINGING AND WHISTLING AND MAKING GRIMACES AT

YEARS WERE GONE THOUGH PARTED FROM ALL HIS SOUL HELD DEAR AND THOUGH OFTEN YEARNING FOR WHAT LAY BEYOND STILL WAS HE NEVER POSITIVELY AND CONSCIOUSLY MISERABLE FOR SO WELL IS THE HARP OF HUMAN FEELING STRUNG THAT NOTHING BUT A CRASH THAT BREAKS EVERY STRING CAN WHOLLY MAR ITS HARMONY AND ON LOOKING BACK TO SEASONS WHICH IN REVIEW APPEAR TO US AS THOSE OF DEPRIVATION AND TRIAL WE CAN REMEMBER THAT EACH HOUR AS IT GLIDED BROUGHT ITS DIVERSIONS AND ALLEVIATIONS SO THAT THOUGH NOT HAPPY WHOLLY WE WERE NOT EITHER WHOLLY MISERABLE TOM READ IN HIS ONLY LITERARY CABINET OF ONE WHO HAD LEARNED IN WHATSOEVER STATE HE WAS THEREWITH TO BE CONTENT IT SEEMED TO HIM GOOD AND REASONABLE DOCTRINE AND ACCORDED WELL WITH THE SETTLED AND THOUGHTFUL HABIT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED FROM THE READING OF THAT SAME BOOK HIS LETTER HOMEWARD AS WE RELATED IN THE LAST CHAPTER WAS IN DUE TIME ANSWERED BY MASTER GEORGE IN A GOOD ROUND SCHOOLBOY HAND THAT TOM SAID MIGHT BE READ MOST ACROST THE ROOM IT CONTAINED VARIOUS REFRESHING ITEMS OF HOME INTELLIGENCE WITH WHICH OUR READER IS FULLY ACQUAINTED STATED HOW AUNT CHLOE HAD BEEN HIRED OUT TO A CONFECTIONER IN LOUISVILLE WHERE HER SKILL IN THE PASTRY LINE WAS GAINING WONDERFUL SUMS OF MONEY ALL OF WHICH TOM WAS INFORMED WAS TO BE LAID UP TO GO TO MAKE UP THE SUM OF HIS REDEMPTION MONEY MOSE AND PETE WERE THRIVING AND THE BABY WAS TROTTING ALL ABOUT THE HOUSE UNDER THE CARE OF SALLY AND THE FAMILY GENERALLY TOMS CABIN WAS SHUT UP FOR THE PRESENT BUT GEORGE EXPATIATED BRILLIANTLY ON ORNAMENTS AND ADDITIONS TO BE MADE TO IT WHEN TOM CAME BACK THE REST OF THIS LETTER GAVE A LIST OF GEORGES SCHOOL STUDIES EACH ONE HEADED BY A FLOURISHING CAPITAL AND ALSO TOLD THE NAMES OF FOUR NEW COLTS THAT APPEARED ON THE PREMISES SINCE TOM LEFT AND STATED IN THE SAME CONNECTION THAT FATHER AND MOTHER WERE WELL THE STYLE OF THE LETTER WAS DECIDEDLY CONCISE AND TERSE BUT TOM THOUGHT IT THE MOST WONDERFUL SPECIMEN OF COMPOSITION THAT HAD APPEARED IN MODERN TIMES HE WAS NEVER TIRED OF LOOKING AT IT AND EVEN HELD A COUNCIL WITH EVA ON THE EXPEDIENCY OF GETTING IT FRAMED TO HANG UP IN HIS ROOM NOTHING BUT THE DIFFICULTY OF ARRANGING IT SO THAT BOTH SIDES OF THE PAGE WOULD SHOW AT ONCE STOOD IN THE WAY OF THIS UNDERTAKING THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN TOM AND EVA HAD GROWN WITH THE CHILDS GROWTH IT WOULD BE HARD TO SAY WHAT PLACE SHE HELD IN THE SOFT IMPRESSIBLE HEART OF HER FAITHFUL ATTENDANT HE LOVED HER AS SOMETHING FRAIL AND EARTHLY YET ALMOST WORSHIPPED HER AS SOMETHING HEAVENLY AND DIVINE HE GAZED ON HER AS THE ITALIAN SAILOR GAZES ON HIS IMAGE OF THE CHILD JESUSWITH A MIXTURE OF REVERENCE AND TENDERNESS AND TO HUMOR HER GRACEFUL FANCIES AND MEET THOSE THOUSAND SIMPLE WANTS WHICH INVEST CHILDHOOD LIKE A MANYCOLORED RAINBOW WAS TOMS CHIEF DELIGHT IN THE MARKET AT MORNING HIS EYES WERE ALWAYS ON THE FLOWERSTALLS FOR RARE BOUQUETS FOR HER AND THE CHOICEST PEACH OR ORANGE WAS SLIPPED INTO HIS POCKET TO GIVE TO HER WHEN HE CAME BACK AND THE SIGHT THAT PLEASED HIM MOST WAS HER SUNNY HEAD LOOKING OUT THE GATE FOR HIS DISTANT APPROACH AND HER CHILDISH QUESTIONSWELL UNCLE TOM WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR ME TODAY NOR WAS EVA LESS ZEALOUS IN KIND OFFICES IN RETURN THOUGH A CHILD SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL READERA FINE MUSICAL EAR A QUICK POETIC FANCY AND AN INSTINCTIVE SYMPATHY WITH WHATS GRAND AND NOBLE MADE HER SUCH A READER OF THE BIBLE AS TOM HAD NEVER BEFORE HEARD AT FIRST SHE READ TO PLEASE HER HUMBLE FRIEND BUT SOON HER OWN EARNEST NATURE THREW OUT ITS TENDRILS AND WOUND ITSELF AROUND THE MAJESTIC BOOK AND EVA LOVED IT BECAUSE IT WOKE IN HER STRANGE YEARNINGS AND STRONG DIM EMOTIONS SUCH AS IMPASSIONED IMAGINATIVE CHILDREN LOVE TO FEEL THE PARTS THAT PLEASED HER MOST WERE THE REVELATIONS AND THE PROPHECIESPARTS WHOSE DIM AND WONDROUS IMAGERY AND FERVENT LANGUAGE IMPRESSED HER THE MORE THAT SHE QUESTIONED VAINLY OF THEIR MEANINGAND SHE AND HER SIMPLE FRIEND THE OLD CHILD AND THE YOUNG ONE FELT JUST ALIKE ABOUT IT ALL THAT THEY KNEW WAS THAT THEY SPOKE OF A GLORY TO BE REVEALEDA WONDROUS SOMETHING YET TO COME WHEREIN THEIR SOUL REJOICED YET KNEW NOT WHY AND THOUGH IT BE NOT SO IN THE PHYSICAL YET IN MORAL SCIENCE THAT WHICH CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD IS NOT ALWAYS PROFITLESS FOR THE SOUL AWAKES A TREMBLING STRANGER BETWEEN TWO DIM ETERNITIESTHE ETERNAL PAST THE ETERNAL FUTURE THE LIGHT SHINES ONLY ON A SMALL SPACE AROUND HER THEREFORE SHE NEEDS MUST YEARN TOWARDS THE UNKNOWN AND THE VOICES AND SHADOWY MOVINGS WHICH COME TO HER FROM OUT THE CLOUDY PILLAR OF INSPIRATION HAVE EACH ONE ECHOES AND ANSWERS IN HER OWN EXPECTING NATURE ITS MYSTIC IMAGERY ARE SO MANY TALISMANS AND GEMS INSCRIBED WITH UNKNOWN HIEROGLYPHICS SHE FOLDS THEM IN HER BOSOM AND EXPECTS TO READ THEM WHEN SHE PASSES BEYOND THE VEIL ILLUSTRATION LITTLE

DRIVEN ALL WHO WERE ABLE TO LEAVE THE SULTRY AND UNHEALTHY CITY TO SEEK THE SHORES OF THE LAKE AND ITS COOL SEABREEZES ST CLARES VILLA WAS AN EAST INDIAN COTTAGE SURROUNDED BY LIGHT VERANDAHS OF BAMBOOWORK AND OPENING ON ALL SIDES INTO GARDENS AND PLEASUREGROUNDS THE COMMON SITTINGROOM OPENED ON TO A LARGE GARDEN FRAGRANT WITH EVERY PICTURESQUE PLANT AND FLOWER OF THE TROPICS WHERE WINDING PATHS RAN DOWN TO THE VERY SHORES OF THE LAKE WHOSE SILVERY SHEET OF WATER LAY THERE RISING AND FALLING IN THE SUNBEAMSA PICTURE NEVER FOR AN HOUR THE SAME YET EVERY HOUR MORE BEAUTIFUL IT IS NOW ONE OF THOSE INTENSELY GOLDEN SUNSETS WHICH KINDLES THE WHOLE HORIZON INTO ONE BLAZE OF GLORY AND MAKES THE WATER ANOTHER SKY THE LAKE LAY IN ROSY OR GOLDEN STREAKS SAVE WHERE WHITEWINGED VESSELS GLIDED HITHER AND THITHER LIKE SO MANY SPIRITS AND LITTLE GOLDEN STARS TWINKLED THROUGH THE GLOW AND LOOKED DOWN AT THEMSELVES AS THEY TREMBLED IN THE WATER TOM AND EVA WERE SEATED ON A LITTLE MOSSY SEAT IN AN ARBOR AT THE FOOT OF THE GARDEN IT WAS SUNDAY EVENING AND EVAS BIBLE LAY OPEN ON HER KNEE SHE READAND I SAW A SEA OF GLASS MINGLED WITH FIRE TOM SAID EVA SUDDENLY STOPPING AND POINTING TO THE LAKE THERE T IS WHAT MISS EVA DONT YOU SEETHERE SAID THE CHILD POINTING TO THE GLASSY WATER WHICH AS IT ROSE AND FELL REFLECTED THE GOLDEN GLOW OF THE SKY THERES A SEA OF GLASS MINGLED WITH FIRE TRUE ENOUGH MISS EVA SAID TOM AND TOM SANG O HAD I THE WINGS OF THE MORNING ID FLY AWAY TO CANAANS SHORE BRIGHT ANGELS SHOULD CONVEY ME HOME TO THE NEW JERUSALEM WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE NEW JERUSALEM IS UNCLE

SPIRITS BRIGHT TOM SUNG THE WORDS OF A WELLKNOWN METHODIST HYMN I SEE A BAND OF SPIRITS BRIGHT THAT TASTE THE GLORIES THERE THEY ALL ARE ROBED IN SPOTLESS WHITE AND CONQUERING PALMS THEY BEAR UNCLE TOM IVE SEEN THEM SAID EVA TOM HAD NO DOUBT OF IT AT ALL IT DID NOT SURPRISE HIM IN THE LEAST IF EVA HAD TOLD HIM SHE HAD BEEN TO HEAVEN HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT ENTIRELY PROBABLE THEY COME TO ME SOMETIMES IN MY SLEEP THOSE SPIRITS AND EVAS EYES GREW DREAMY AND SHE HUMMED IN A LOW VOICE THEY ARE ALL ROBED IN SPOTLESS WHITE AND CONQUERING PALMS THEY BEAR UNCLE TOM SAID EVA IM GOING THERE WHERE MISS EVA THE CHILD ROSE AND POINTED HER LITTLE HAND TO THE SKY THE GLOW OF EVENING LIT HER GOLDEN HAIR AND FLUSHED CHEEK WITH A KIND OF UNEARTHLY RADIANCE AND HER EYES WERE BENT EARNESTLY ON THE SKIES IM GOING THERE SHE SAID TO THE SPIRITS BRIGHT TOM IM GOING BEFORE LONG THE FAITHFUL OLD HEART FELT A SUDDEN THRUST AND TOM THOUGHT HOW OFTEN HE HAD NOTICED WITHIN SIX MONTHS THAT EVAS LITTLE HANDS HAD GROWN THINNER AND HER SKIN MORE TRANSPARENT AND HER BREATH SHORTER AND HOW WHEN SHE RAN OR PLAYED IN THE GARDEN AS SHE ONCE COULD FOR HOURS SHE BECAME SOON SO TIRED AND LANGUID HE HAD HEARD MISS OPHELIA SPEAK OFTEN OF A COUGH THAT ALL HER MEDICAMENTS COULD NOT CURE AND EVEN NOW THAT FERVENT CHEEK AND LITTLE HAND WERE BURNING WITH HECTIC FEVER AND YET THE THOUGHT THAT EVAS WORDS SUGGESTED HAD NEVER COME TO HIM TILL NOW HAS THERE EVER BEEN A CHILD LIKE EVA YES THERE HAVE BEEN BUT THEIR NAMES ARE ALWAYS ON GRAVESTONES AND THEIR SWEET SMILES THEIR HEAVENLY EYES THEIR SINGULAR WORDS AND WAYS ARE AMONG THE BURIED TREASURES OF YEARNING HEARTS IN HOW MANY FAMILIES DO YOU HEAR THE LEGEND THAT ALL THE GOODNESS AND GRACES OF THE LIVING ARE NOTHING TO THE PECULIAR CHARMS OF ONE WHO IS NOT IT IS AS IF HEAVEN HAD AN ESPECIAL BAND OF ANGELS WHOSE OFFICE IT WAS TO SOJOURN FOR A SEASON HERE AND ENDEAR TO THEM THE WAYWARD HUMAN HEART THAT THEY MIGHT BEAR IT UPWARD WITH THEM IN THEIR HOMEWARD FLIGHT WHEN YOU SEE THAT DEEP SPIRITUAL LIGHT IN THE EYEWHEN THE LITTLE SOUL REVEALS ITSELF IN WORDS SWEETER AND WISER THAN THE ORDINARY WORDS OF CHILDRENHOPE NOT TO RETAIN THAT CHILD FOR THE SEAL OF HEAVEN IS ON IT AND THE LIGHT OF IMMORTALITY LOOKS OUT FROM ITS EYES EVEN SO BELOVED EVA FAIR STAR OF THY DWELLING THOU ART PASSING AWAY BUT THEY THAT LOVE THEE DEAREST KNOW IT NOT THE COLLOQUY

BY HER MORE THAN BEFORE TOOK HER OFTENER TO RIDE WITH HIM BROUGHT HOME EVERY FEW DAYS SOME RECEIPT OR STRENGTHENING MIXTURENOT HE SAID THAT THE CHILD NEEDED IT BUT THEN IT WOULD NOT DO HER ANY HARM IF IT MUST BE TOLD THE THING THAT STRUCK A DEEPER PANG TO HIS HEART THAN ANYTHING ELSE WAS THE DAILY INCREASING MATURITY OF THE CHILDS MIND AND FEELINGS WHILE STILL RETAINING ALL A CHILDS FANCIFUL GRACES YET SHE OFTEN DROPPED UNCONSCIOUSLY WORDS OF SUCH A REACH OF THOUGHT AND STRANGE UNWORLDLY WISDOM THAT THEY SEEMED TO BE AN INSPIRATION AT SUCH TIMES ST CLARE WOULD FEEL A SUDDEN THRILL AND CLASP HER

THE BEATING HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY THE TWO BROTHERS ST CLARE FROM ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN AUGUSTINES CHEEK FLUSHED BUT HE ONLY OBSERVED WITH HIS USUAL SARCASTIC CARELESSNESS I SUPPOSE THATS WHAT WE

COULDNT HELP IT IF I DIDNT HENRIQUE IS A REGULAR LITTLE TEMPESTHIS MOTHER AND I HAVE GIVEN HIM UP LONG AGO BUT THEN THAT DODO IS A PERFECT SPRITENO AMOUNT OF WHIPPING CAN HURT HIM AND THIS BY WAY OF TEACHING HENRIQUE THE FIRST VERSE OF A REPUBLICANS CATECHISM ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL POH SAID ALFRED ONE OF TOM JEFFERSONS PIECES OF FRENCH SENTIMENT AND HUMBUG ITS PERFECTLY RIDICULOUS TO HAVE THAT GOING THE ROUNDS AMONG US TO THIS DAY I THINK IT IS SAID ST CLARE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE SAID ALFRED WE CAN SEE PLAINLY ENOUGH THAT ALL MEN ARE NOT BORN FREE NOR BORN EQUAL THEY ARE BORN ANYTHING ELSE FOR MY PART I THINK HALF THIS REPUBLICAN TALK SHEER HUMBUG IT IS THE EDUCATED THE INTELLIGENT THE WEALTHY THE REFINED WHO OUGHT TO HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS AND NOT THE CANAILLE IF YOU CAN KEEP THE CANAILLE OF THAT OPINION SAID AUGUSTINE THEY TOOK THEIR TURN ONCE IN FRANCE OF COURSE THEY MUST BE KEPT DOWN CONSISTENTLY STEADILY AS I SHOULD SAID ALFRED SETTING HIS FOOT HARD DOWN AS IF HE WERE STANDING ON SOMEBODY IT MAKES A TERRIBLE SLIP WHEN THEY GET UP SAID AUGUSTINEIN ST DOMINGO FOR INSTANCE POH SAID ALFRED WELL TAKE CARE OF THAT IN THIS COUNTRY WE MUST SET OUR FACE AGAINST ALL THIS EDUCATING ELEVATING TALK THAT IS GETTING ABOUT NOW THE LOWER CLASS MUST NOT BE EDUCATED THAT IS PAST PRAYING FOR SAID AUGUSTINE EDUCATED THEY WILL BE AND WE HAVE ONLY TO SAY HOW OUR SYSTEM IS EDUCATING THEM IN BARBARISM AND BRUTALITY WE ARE BREAKING ALL HUMANIZING TIES AND MAKING THEM BRUTE BEASTS AND IF THEY GET THE UPPER HAND SUCH WE SHALL FIND THEM THEY SHALL NEVER GET THE UPPER HAND SAID ALFRED THATS RIGHT SAID ST CLARE PUT ON THE STEAM FASTEN DOWN THE ESCAPEVALVE AND SIT ON IT AND SEE WHERE YOULL LAND WELL SAID ALFRED WE WILL SEE IM NOT AFRAID TO SIT ON THE ESCAPEVALVE AS LONG AS THE BOILERS ARE STRONG AND THE MACHINERY WORKS WELL THE NOBLES IN LOUIS XVIS TIME THOUGHT JUST SO AND AUSTRIA AND PIUS IX THINK SO NOW AND SOME PLEASANT MORNING YOU MAY ALL BE CAUGHT UP TO MEET EACH OTHER IN THE AIR WHEN THE BOILERS BURST DIES DECLARABIT SAID ALFRED LAUGHING I TELL YOU SAID AUGUSTINE IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT IS REVEALED WITH THE STRENGTH OF A DIVINE LAW IN OUR TIMES IT IS THAT THE MASSES ARE TO RISE AND THE UNDER CLASS BECOME THE UPPER ONE THATS ONE OF YOUR RED REPUBLICAN HUMBUGS AUGUSTINE WHY DIDNT YOU EVER TAKE TO THE STUMPYOUD MAKE A FAMOUS STUMP ORATOR WELL I HOPE I SHALL BE DEAD BEFORE THIS MILLENNIUM OF YOUR GREASY MASSES COMES ON GREASY OR NOT GREASY THEY WILL GOVERN YOU WHEN THEIR TIME COMES SAID AUGUSTINE AND THEY WILL BE JUST SUCH RULERS AS YOU MAKE THEM THE FRENCH NOBLESSE CHOSE TO HAVE THE PEOPLE SANS CULOTTES AND THEY HAD SANS CULOTTE GOVERNORS TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT THE PEOPLE OF HAYTI O COME AUGUSTINE AS IF WE HADNT HAD ENOUGH OF THAT ABOMINABLE CONTEMPTIBLE HAYTI THE HAYTIENS WERE NOT ANGLO SAXONS IF THEY HAD BEEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER STORY THE ANGLO SAXON IS THE DOMINANT RACE OF THE WORLD AND IS TO BE SO IN AUGUST AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THE BLACK SLAVES AND MULATTOES ON HAITI ROSE IN REVOLT AGAINST THE WHITES AND IN THE PERIOD OF TURMOIL THAT FOLLOWED ENORMOUS CRUELTIES WERE PRACTISED BY BOTH SIDES THE EMPEROR DESSALINES COME TO POWER IN MASSACRED ALL THE WHITES ON THE ISLAND HAITIAN BLOODSHED BECAME AN ARGUMENT TO SHOW THE BARBAROUS NATURE OF THE NEGRO A DOCTRINE WENDELL PHILLIPS SOUGHT TO COMBAT IN HIS CELEBRATED LECTURE ON TOUSSAINT LOUVERTURE WELL THERE IS A PRETTY FAIR INFUSION OF ANGLO SAXON BLOOD AMONG OUR SLAVES NOW SAID AUGUSTINE THERE ARE PLENTY AMONG THEM WHO HAVE ONLY ENOUGH OF THE AFRICAN TO GIVE A SORT OF TROPICAL WARMTH AND FERVOR TO OUR CALCULATING FIRMNESS AND FORESIGHT IF EVER THE SAN DOMINGO HOUR COMES ANGLO SAXON BLOOD WILL LEAD ON THE DAY SONS OF WHITE FATHERS WITH ALL OUR HAUGHTY FEELINGS BURNING IN THEIR VEINS WILL NOT ALWAYS BE BOUGHT AND SOLD AND TRADED THEY WILL RISE AND RAISE WITH THEM THEIR MOTHERS RACE STUFFNONSENSE WELL SAID AUGUSTINE THERE GOES AN OLD SAYING TO THIS EFFECT AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF NOAH SO SHALL IT BETHEY ATE THEY DRANK THEY PLANTED THEY BUILDED AND KNEW NOT TILL THE FLOOD CAME AND TOOK THEM ON THE WHOLE AUGUSTINE I THINK YOUR TALENTS MIGHT DO FOR A CIRCUIT RIDER SAID ALFRED LAUGHING NEVER YOU FEAR FOR US POSSESSION IS OUR NINE POINTS WEVE GOT THE POWER THIS SUBJECT RACE SAID HE STAMPING FIRMLY IS DOWN AND SHALL STAY DOWN WE HAVE ENERGY ENOUGH TO MANAGE OUR OWN POWDER SONS TRAINED LIKE YOUR HENRIQUE WILL BE GRAND GUARDIANS OF YOUR POWDERMAGAZINES SAID AUGUSTINESO COOL AND SELFPOSSESSED THE PROVERB SAYS THEY THAT CANNOT GOVERN THEMSELVES CANNOT GOVERN OTHERS THERE IS A TROUBLE THERE SAID ALFRED THOUGHTFULLY THERES NO DOUBT THAT OUR SYSTEM IS A DIFFICULT ONE TO TRAIN CHILDREN UNDER IT GIVES TOO FREE SCOPE TO THE PASSIONS ALTOGETHER WHICH IN OUR CLIMATE ARE HOT ENOUGH I FIND TROUBLE WITH HENRIQUE THE BOY IS GENEROUS AND WARMHEARTED BUT A PERFECT FIRECRACKER WHEN EXCITED I BELIEVE I SHALL SEND HIM NORTH FOR HIS EDUCATION WHERE OBEDIENCE IS MORE FASHIONABLE AND WHERE HE WILL ASSOCIATE MORE WITH EQUALS AND LESS WITH DEPENDENTS SINCE TRAINING CHILDREN IS THE STAPLE WORK OF THE HUMAN RACE SAID AUGUSTINE I SHOULD THINK IT SOMETHING OF A CONSIDERATION THAT OUR SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK WELL THERE IT DOES NOT FOR SOME THINGS SAID ALFRED FOR OTHERS AGAIN IT DOES IT MAKES BOYS MANLY AND COURAGEOUS AND THE VERY VICES OF AN ABJECT RACE TEND TO STRENGTHEN IN THEM THE OPPOSITE VIRTUES I THINK HENRIQUE NOW HAS A KEENER SENSE OF THE BEAUTY OF TRUTH FROM SEEING LYING AND DECEPTION THE UNIVERSAL BADGE OF SLAVERY A CHRISTIANLIKE VIEW OF THE SUBJECT CERTAINLY SAID AUGUSTINE ITS TRUE CHRISTIANLIKE OR NOT AND IS ABOUT AS CHRISTIANLIKE AS MOST OTHER THINGS IN THE WORLD SAID ALFRED THAT MAY BE SAID ST CLARE WELL THERES NO USE IN TALKING AUGUSTINE I BELIEVE WEVE BEEN ROUND AND ROUND THIS OLD TRACK FIVE HUNDRED TIMES MORE OR LESS WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A GAME OF BACKGAMMON THE TWO BROTHERS RAN UP THE VERANDAH STEPS

STAND UP UNDER IT AS TELL ME TO ELEVATE MY SERVANTS UNDER ALL THE SUPERINCUMBENT MASS OF SOCIETY UPON THEM ONE MAN CAN DO NOTHING AGAINST THE WHOLE ACTION OF A COMMUNITY EDUCATION TO DO ANYTHING MUST BE A STATE EDUCATION OR THERE MUST BE ENOUGH AGREED IN IT TO MAKE A CURRENT YOU TAKE THE FIRST THROW SAID ALFRED AND THE BROTHERS WERE SOON LOST IN THE GAME AND HEARD NO MORE TILL THE SCRAPING OF HORSES FEET WAS HEARD UNDER THE VERANDAH THERE COME THE CHILDREN SAID AUGUSTINE RISING LOOK HERE ALF DID YOU EVER SEE ANYTHING SO BEAUTIFUL AND IN TRUTH IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT HENRIQUE WITH HIS BOLD

WAS CALLED MARIE ST CLARE HAD TAKEN NO NOTICE OF THE CHILDS GRADUALLY DECAYING HEALTH AND STRENGTH BECAUSE SHE WAS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN STUDYING OUT TWO OR THREE NEW FORMS OF DISEASE TO WHICH SHE BELIEVED SHE HERSELF WAS A VICTIM IT WAS THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF MARIES BELIEF THAT NOBODY EVER WAS OR COULD BE SO GREAT A SUFFERER AS HERSELF AND THEREFORE SHE ALWAYS REPELLED QUITE INDIGNANTLY ANY SUGGESTION THAT ANY ONE AROUND HER COULD BE SICK SHE WAS ALWAYS SURE IN SUCH A CASE THAT IT WAS NOTHING BUT LAZINESS OR WANT OF ENERGY AND THAT IF THEY HAD HAD THE SUFFERING SHE HAD THEY WOULD SOON KNOW THE DIFFERENCE MISS OPHELIA HAD SEVERAL TIMES TRIED TO AWAKEN HER MATERNAL FEARS ABOUT EVA BUT TO NO AVAIL I DONT SEE AS ANYTHING AILS THE CHILD SHE WOULD SAY SHE RUNS ABOUT AND PLAYS BUT SHE HAS A COUGH COUGH YOU DONT NEED TO TELL ME ABOUT A COUGH IVE ALWAYS BEEN SUBJECT TO A COUGH ALL MY DAYS WHEN I WAS OF EVAS AGE THEY THOUGHT I WAS IN A CONSUMPTION NIGHT AFTER NIGHT MAMMY USED TO SIT UP WITH ME O EVAS COUGH IS NOT ANYTHING BUT SHE GETS WEAK AND IS SHORTBREATHED LAW IVE HAD THAT YEARS AND YEARS ITS ONLY A NERVOUS AFFECTION BUT SHE SWEATS SO NIGHTS WELL I HAVE THESE TEN YEARS VERY OFTEN NIGHT AFTER NIGHT MY CLOTHES WILL BE WRINGING WET THERE WONT BE A DRY THREAD IN MY NIGHTCLOTHES AND THE SHEETS WILL BE SO THAT MAMMY HAS TO HANG THEM UP TO DRY EVA DOESNT SWEAT ANYTHING LIKE THAT MISS OPHELIA SHUT HER MOUTH FOR A SEASON BUT NOW THAT EVA WAS FAIRLY AND VISIBLY PROSTRATED AND A DOCTOR CALLED MARIE ALL ON A SUDDEN TOOK A NEW TURN SHE KNEW IT SHE SAID SHE ALWAYS FELT IT THAT SHE WAS DESTINED TO BE THE MOST MISERABLE OF MOTHERS HERE SHE WAS WITH HER WRETCHED HEALTH AND HER ONLY DARLING CHILD GOING DOWN TO THE GRAVE BEFORE HER EYESAND MARIE ROUTED UP MAMMY NIGHTS AND RUMPUSSED AND SCOLDED WITH MORE ENERGY THAN EVER ALL DAY ON THE STRENGTH OF THIS NEW MISERY MY DEAR MARIE DONT TALK SO SAID ST CLARE YOU OUGHT NOT TO GIVE UP THE CASE SO AT ONCE YOU HAVE NOT A MOTHERS FEELINGS ST CLARE YOU NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND MEYOU DONT NOW BUT DONT TALK SO AS IF IT WERE A GONE CASE I CANT TAKE IT AS INDIFFERENTLY AS YOU CAN ST CLARE IF YOU DONT FEEL WHEN YOUR ONLY CHILD IS IN THIS ALARMING STATE I DO ITS A BLOW TOO MUCH FOR ME WITH ALL I WAS BEARING BEFORE ITS TRUE SAID ST CLARE THAT EVA IS VERY DELICATE THAT I ALWAYS KNEW AND THAT SHE HAS GROWN SO RAPIDLY AS TO EXHAUST HER STRENGTH AND THAT HER SITUATION IS CRITICAL BUT JUST NOW SHE IS ONLY PROSTRATED BY THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER AND BY THE EXCITEMENT OF HER COUSINS VISIT AND THE EXERTIONS SHE MADE THE PHYSICIAN SAYS THERE IS ROOM FOR HOPE WELL OF COURSE IF YOU CAN LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE PRAY DO ITS A MERCY IF PEOPLE HAVENT SENSITIVE FEELINGS IN THIS WORLD I AM SURE I WISH I DIDNT FEEL AS I DO IT ONLY MAKES ME COMPLETELY WRETCHED I WISH I COULD BE AS EASY AS THE REST OF YOU AND THE REST OF THEM HAD GOOD REASON TO BREATHE THE SAME PRAYER FOR MARIE PARADED HER NEW MISERY AS THE REASON AND APOLOGY FOR ALL SORTS OF INFLICTIONS ON EVERY ONE ABOUT HER EVERY WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN BY ANYBODY EVERYTHING THAT WAS DONE OR WAS NOT DONE EVERYWHERE WAS ONLY A NEW PROOF THAT SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY HARDHEARTED INSENSIBLE BEINGS WHO WERE UNMINDFUL OF HER PECULIAR SORROWS POOR EVA HEARD SOME OF THESE SPEECHES AND NEARLY CRIED HER LITTLE EYES OUT IN PITY FOR HER MAMMA AND IN SORROW THAT SHE SHOULD MAKE HER SO MUCH DISTRESS IN A WEEK OR TWO THERE WAS A GREAT IMPROVEMENT OF SYMPTOMSONE OF THOSE DECEITFUL LULLS BY WHICH HER INEXORABLE DISEASE SO OFTEN BEGUILES THE ANXIOUS HEART EVEN ON THE VERGE OF THE GRAVE EVAS STEP WAS AGAIN IN THE GARDENIN THE BALCONIES SHE PLAYED AND LAUGHED AGAINAND HER FATHER IN A TRANSPORT DECLARED THAT THEY SHOULD SOON HAVE HER AS HEARTY AS ANYBODY MISS OPHELIA AND THE PHYSICIAN ALONE FELT NO ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THIS ILLUSIVE TRUCE THERE WAS ONE OTHER HEART TOO THAT FELT THE SAME CERTAINTY AND THAT WAS THE LITTLE HEART OF EVA WHAT IS IT THAT SOMETIMES SPEAKS IN THE SOUL SO CALMLY SO CLEARLY THAT ITS EARTHLY TIME IS SHORT IS IT THE SECRET INSTINCT OF DECAYING NATURE OR THE SOULS IMPULSIVE THROB AS IMMORTALITY DRAWS ON BE IT WHAT IT MAY IT RESTED IN THE HEART OF EVA A CALM SWEET PROPHETIC CERTAINTY THAT HEAVEN WAS NEAR CALM AS THE LIGHT OF SUNSET SWEET AS THE BRIGHT STILLNESS OF AUTUMN THERE HER LITTLE HEART REPOSED ONLY TROUBLED BY SORROW FOR THOSE WHO LOVED HER SO DEARLY FOR THE CHILD THOUGH NURSED SO TENDERLY AND THOUGH LIFE WAS UNFOLDING BEFORE HER WITH EVERY BRIGHTNESS THAT LOVE AND WEALTH COULD GIVE HAD NO REGRET FOR HERSELF IN DYING IN THAT BOOK WHICH SHE AND HER SIMPLE OLD FRIEND HAD READ SO MUCH TOGETHER SHE HAD SEEN AND TAKEN TO HER YOUNG HEART THE IMAGE OF ONE WHO LOVED THE LITTLE CHILD AND AS SHE GAZED AND MUSED HE HAD CEASED TO BE AN IMAGE AND A PICTURE OF THE DISTANT PAST AND COME TO BE A LIVING ALLSURROUNDING REALITY HIS LOVE ENFOLDED HER CHILDISH HEART WITH MORE THAN MORTAL TENDERNESS AND IT WAS TO HIM SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING AND TO HIS HOME BUT HER HEART YEARNED WITH SAD TENDERNESS FOR ALL THAT SHE WAS TO LEAVE BEHIND HER FATHER MOSTFOR EVA THOUGH SHE NEVER DISTINCTLY THOUGHT SO HAD AN INSTINCTIVE PERCEPTION THAT SHE WAS MORE IN HIS HEART THAN ANY OTHER SHE LOVED HER MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS SO LOVING A CREATURE AND ALL THE SELFISHNESS THAT SHE HAD SEEN IN HER ONLY SADDENED AND PERPLEXED HER FOR SHE HAD A CHILDS IMPLICIT TRUST THAT HER MOTHER COULD NOT DO WRONG THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HER THAT EVA NEVER COULD MAKE OUT AND SHE ALWAYS SMOOTHED IT OVER WITH THINKING THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS MAMMA AND SHE LOVED HER VERY DEARLY INDEED SHE FELT TOO FOR THOSE FOND FAITHFUL SERVANTS TO WHOM SHE WAS AS DAYLIGHT AND SUNSHINE CHILDREN DO NOT USUALLY GENERALIZE BUT EVA WAS AN UNCOMMONLY MATURE CHILD AND THE THINGS THAT SHE HAD WITNESSED OF THE EVILS OF THE SYSTEM UNDER WHICH THEY WERE LIVING HAD FALLEN ONE BY ONE INTO THE DEPTHS OF HER THOUGHTFUL PONDERING HEART SHE HAD VAGUE LONGINGS TO DO SOMETHING FOR THEMTO BLESS AND SAVE NOT ONLY THEM BUT ALL IN THEIR CONDITIONLONGINGS THAT CONTRASTED SADLY WITH THE FEEBLENESS OF HER LITTLE FRAME UNCLE TOM SHE SAID ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS READING TO HER FRIEND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY

LAST OF EARTH THIS IS THE LAST OF EARTH I AM CONTENT LAST WORDS OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS UTTERED FEBRUARY THE STATUETTES AND PICTURES IN EVAS ROOM WERE SHROUDED IN WHITE NAPKINS AND ONLY HUSHED BREATHINGS AND MUFFLED FOOTFALLS WERE HEARD THERE AND THE LIGHT STOLE IN SOLEMNLY THROUGH WINDOWS PARTIALLY DARKENED BY CLOSED BLINDS THE BED WAS DRAPED IN WHITE AND THERE BENEATH THE DROOPING ANGELFIGURE LAY A LITTLE SLEEPING FORMSLEEPING NEVER TO WAKEN THERE SHE LAY ROBED IN ONE OF THE SIMPLE WHITE DRESSES SHE HAD BEEN WONT TO WEAR WHEN LIVING THE ROSECOLORED LIGHT THROUGH THE CURTAINS CAST OVER THE ICY COLDNESS OF DEATH A WARM GLOW THE HEAVY EYELASHES DROOPED SOFTLY ON THE PURE CHEEK THE HEAD WAS TURNED A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE AS IF IN NATURAL SLEEP BUT THERE WAS DIFFUSED OVER EVERY LINEAMENT OF THE FACE THAT HIGH CELESTIAL EXPRESSION THAT MINGLING OF RAPTURE AND REPOSE WHICH SHOWED IT WAS NO EARTHLY OR TEMPORARY SLEEP BUT THE LONG SACRED REST WHICH HE GIVETH TO HIS BELOVED THERE IS NO DEATH TO SUCH AS THOU DEAR EVA NEITHER DARKNESS NOR SHADOW OF DEATH ONLY SUCH A BRIGHT FADING AS WHEN THE MORNING STAR FADES IN THE GOLDEN DAWN THINE IS THE VICTORY WITHOUT THE BATTLETHE CROWN WITHOUT THE CONFLICT SO DID ST CLARE THINK AS WITH FOLDED ARMS HE STOOD THERE GAZING AH WHO SHALL SAY WHAT HE DID THINK FOR FROM THE HOUR THAT VOICES HAD SAID IN THE DYING CHAMBER SHE IS GONE IT HAD BEEN ALL A DREARY MIST A HEAVY DIMNESS OF ANGUISH HE HAD HEARD VOICES AROUND HIM HE HAD HAD QUESTIONS ASKED AND ANSWERED THEM THEY HAD ASKED HIM WHEN HE WOULD HAVE THE FUNERAL AND WHERE THEY SHOULD LAY HER AND HE HAD ANSWERED IMPATIENTLY THAT HE CARED NOT ADOLPH AND ROSA HAD ARRANGED THE CHAMBER VOLATILE FICKLE AND CHILDISH AS THEY GENERALLY WERE THEY WERE SOFTHEARTED AND FULL OF FEELING AND WHILE MISS OPHELIA PRESIDED OVER THE GENERAL DETAILS OF ORDER AND NEATNESS IT WAS THEIR HANDS THAT ADDED THOSE SOFT POETIC TOUCHES TO THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT TOOK FROM THE DEATHROOM THE GRIM AND GHASTLY AIR WHICH TOO OFTEN MARKS A NEW ENGLAND FUNERAL THERE WERE STILL FLOWERS ON THE SHELVESALL WHITE DELICATE AND FRAGRANT WITH GRACEFUL DROOPING LEAVES EVAS LITTLE TABLE COVERED WITH WHITE BORE ON IT HER FAVORITE VASE WITH A SINGLE WHITE MOSS ROSEBUD IN IT THE FOLDS OF THE DRAPERY THE FALL OF THE CURTAINS HAD BEEN ARRANGED AND REARRANGED BY ADOLPH AND ROSA WITH THAT NICETY OF EYE WHICH CHARACTERIZES THEIR RACE EVEN NOW WHILE ST CLARE STOOD THERE THINKING LITTLE ROSA TRIPPED SOFTLY INTO THE CHAMBER WITH A BASKET OF WHITE FLOWERS SHE STEPPED BACK WHEN SHE SAW ST CLARE AND STOPPED RESPECTFULLY BUT SEEING THAT HE DID NOT OBSERVE HER SHE CAME FORWARD TO PLACE THEM AROUND THE DEAD ST CLARE SAW HER AS IN A DREAM WHILE SHE PLACED IN THE SMALL HANDS A FAIR CAPE JESSAMINE AND WITH ADMIRABLE TASTE DISPOSED OTHER FLOWERS AROUND THE COUCH THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN AND TOPSY HER EYES SWELLED WITH CRYING APPEARED HOLDING SOMETHING UNDER HER APRON ROSA MADE A QUICK FORBIDDING GESTURE BUT SHE TOOK A STEP INTO THE ROOM YOU MUST GO OUT SAID ROSA IN A SHARP POSITIVE WHISPER YOU HAVENT ANY BUSINESS HERE O DO LET ME I BROUGHT A FLOWERSUCH A PRETTY ONE SAID TOPSY HOLDING UP A HALFBLOWN TEA ROSEBUD DO LET ME PUT JUST ONE THERE GET ALONG SAID ROSA MORE DECIDEDLY LET HER STAY SAID ST CLARE SUDDENLY STAMPING HIS FOOT SHE SHALL COME ROSA SUDDENLY RETREATED AND TOPSY CAME FORWARD AND LAID HER OFFERING AT THE FEET OF THE CORPSE THEN SUDDENLY WITH A WILD AND BITTER CRY SHE THREW HERSELF ON THE FLOOR ALONGSIDE THE BED AND WEPT AND MOANED ALOUD MISS OPHELIA HASTENED INTO THE ROOM AND TRIED TO RAISE AND SILENCE HER BUT IN VAIN O MISS EVA OH MISS EVA I WISH I S DEAD TOOI DO THERE WAS A PIERCING WILDNESS IN THE CRY THE BLOOD FLUSHED INTO ST CLARES WHITE MARBLELIKE FACE AND THE FIRST TEARS HE HAD SHED SINCE EVA DIED STOOD IN HIS EYES GET UP CHILD SAID MISS OPHELIA IN A SOFTENED VOICE DONT CRY SO MISS EVA IS GONE TO HEAVEN SHE IS AN ANGEL BUT I CANT SEE HER SAID TOPSY I NEVER SHALL SEE HER AND SHE SOBBED AGAIN THEY ALL STOOD A MOMENT IN SILENCE SHE SAID SHE LOVED ME SAID TOPSYSHE DID O DEAR OH DEAR THERE ANT NOBODY LEFT NOWTHERE ANT THATS TRUE ENOUGH SAID ST CLARE BUT DO HE SAID TO MISS OPHELIA SEE IF YOU CANT COMFORT THE POOR CREATURE I JIST WISH I HADNT NEVER BEEN BORN SAID TOPSY I DIDNT WANT TO BE BORN NO WAYS AND I DONT SEE NO USE ON T MISS OPHELIA RAISED HER GENTLY BUT FIRMLY AND TOOK HER FROM THE ROOM BUT AS SHE DID SO SOME TEARS FELL FROM HER EYES TOPSY YOU POOR CHILD SHE SAID AS SHE LED HER INTO HER ROOM DONT GIVE UP I CAN LOVE YOU THOUGH I AM NOT LIKE THAT DEAR LITTLE CHILD I HOPE IVE LEARNT SOMETHING OF THE LOVE OF CHRIST FROM HER I CAN LOVE YOU I DO AND ILL TRY TO HELP YOU TO GROW UP A GOOD CHRISTIAN GIRL MISS OPHELIAS VOICE WAS MORE THAN HER WORDS AND MORE THAN THAT WERE THE HONEST TEARS THAT FELL DOWN HER FACE FROM THAT HOUR SHE ACQUIRED AN INFLUENCE OVER THE MIND OF THE DESTITUTE CHILD THAT SHE NEVER LOST O MY EVA WHOSE LITTLE HOUR ON EARTH DID SO MUCH OF GOOD THOUGHT ST CLARE WHAT ACCOUNT HAVE I TO GIVE FOR MY LONG YEARS THERE WERE FOR A WHILE SOFT WHISPERINGS AND FOOTFALLS IN THE CHAMBER AS ONE AFTER ANOTHER STOLE IN TO LOOK AT THE DEAD AND THEN CAME THE LITTLE COFFIN AND THEN THERE WAS A FUNERAL AND CARRIAGES DROVE TO THE DOOR AND STRANGERS CAME AND WERE SEATED AND THERE WERE WHITE SCARFS AND RIBBONS AND CRAPE BANDS AND MOURNERS DRESSED IN BLACK CRAPE AND THERE WERE WORDS READ FROM THE BIBLE AND PRAYERS OFFERED AND ST CLARE LIVED AND WALKED AND MOVED AS ONE WHO HAS SHED EVERY TEARTO THE LAST HE SAW ONLY ONE THING THAT GOLDEN HEAD IN THE COFFIN BUT THEN HE SAW THE CLOTH SPREAD OVER IT THE LID OF THE COFFIN CLOSED AND HE WALKED WHEN HE WAS PUT BESIDE THE OTHERS DOWN TO A LITTLE PLACE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN AND THERE BY THE MOSSY SEAT WHERE SHE AND TOM HAD TALKED AND SUNG AND READ SO OFTEN WAS THE LITTLE GRAVE ST CLARE STOOD BESIDE ITLOOKED VACANTLY DOWN HE SAW THEM LOWER THE LITTLE COFFIN HE HEARD DIMLY THE SOLEMN WORDS I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE HE THAT BELIEVETH IN ME THOUGH HE WERE DEAD YET SHALL HE LIVE AND AS THE EARTH WAS CAST IN AND FILLED UP THE LITTLE GRAVE HE COULD NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS HIS EVA THAT THEY WERE HIDING FROM HIS SIGHT NOR WAS ITNOT EVA BUT ONLY THE FRAIL SEED OF THAT BRIGHT IMMORTAL FORM WITH WHICH SHE SHALL YET COME FORTH IN THE DAY OF THE LORD JESUS AND THEN ALL WERE GONE AND THE MOURNERS WENT BACK TO THE PLACE WHICH SHOULD KNOW HER NO MORE AND MARIES ROOM WAS DARKENED AND SHE LAY ON THE BED SOBBING AND MOANING IN UNCONTROLLABLE GRIEF AND CALLING EVERY MOMENT FOR THE ATTENTIONS OF ALL HER SERVANTS OF COURSE THEY HAD NO TIME TO CRYWHY SHOULD THEY THE GRIEF WAS HER GRIEF AND SHE WAS FULLY CONVINCED THAT NOBODY ON EARTH DID COULD OR WOULD FEEL IT AS SHE DID ST CLARE DID NOT SHED A TEAR SHE SAID HE DIDNT SYMPATHIZE WITH HER IT WAS PERFECTLY WONDERFUL TO THINK HOW HARDHEARTED AND UNFEELING HE WAS WHEN HE MUST KNOW HOW SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH ARE PEOPLE THE SLAVE OF THEIR EYE AND EAR THAT MANY OF THE SERVANTS REALLY THOUGHT THAT MISSIS WAS THE PRINCIPAL SUFFERER IN THE CASE ESPECIALLY AS MARIE BEGAN TO HAVE HYSTERICAL SPASMS AND SENT FOR THE DOCTOR AND AT LAST DECLARED HERSELF DYING AND IN THE RUNNING AND SCAMPERING AND BRINGING UP HOT BOTTLES AND HEATING OF FLANNELS AND CHAFING AND FUSSING THAT ENSUED THERE WAS QUITE A DIVERSION TOM HOWEVER HAD A FEELING AT HIS OWN HEART THAT DREW HIM TO HIS MASTER HE FOLLOWED HIM WHEREVER HE WALKED WISTFULLY AND SADLY AND WHEN HE SAW HIM SITTING SO PALE AND QUIET IN EVAS ROOM HOLDING BEFORE HIS EYES HER LITTLE OPEN BIBLE THOUGH SEEING NO LETTER OR WORD OF WHAT WAS IN IT THERE WAS MORE SORROW TO TOM IN THAT STILL FIXED TEARLESS EYE THAN IN ALL MARIES MOANS AND LAMENTATIONS IN A FEW DAYS THE ST CLARE FAMILY WERE BACK AGAIN IN THE CITY AUGUSTINE WITH THE RESTLESSNESS OF GRIEF LONGING FOR ANOTHER SCENE TO CHANGE THE CURRENT OF HIS THOUGHTS SO THEY LEFT THE HOUSE AND GARDEN WITH ITS LITTLE GRAVE AND CAME BACK TO NEW ORLEANS AND ST CLARE WALKED THE STREETS BUSILY AND STROVE TO FILL UP THE CHASM IN HIS HEART WITH HURRY AND BUSTLE AND CHANGE OF PLACE AND PEOPLE WHO SAW HIM IN THE STREET OR MET HIM AT THE CAFE KNEW OF HIS LOSS ONLY BY THE WEED ON HIS HAT FOR THERE HE WAS SMILING AND TALKING AND READING THE NEWSPAPER AND SPECULATING ON POLITICS AND ATTENDING TO BUSINESS MATTERS AND WHO COULD SEE THAT ALL THIS SMILING OUTSIDE WAS BUT A HOLLOWED SHELL OVER A HEART THAT WAS A DARK AND SILENT SEPULCHRE MR ST CLARE IS A SINGULAR MAN SAID MARIE TO MISS OPHELIA IN A COMPLAINING TONE I USED TO THINK IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THE WORLD HE

WE ARE IN DEATH SAID MISS OPHELIA ST CLARE ROSE UP AND LAYING THE PAPER DOWN CARELESSLY WALKED TO THE DOOR THAT STOOD OPEN ON THE VERANDAH TO PUT AN END TO A CONVERSATION THAT WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO HIM MECHANICALLY HE REPEATED THE LAST WORD AGAINDEATHAND AS HE LEANED AGAINST THE RAILINGS AND WATCHED THE SPARKLING WATER AS IT ROSE AND FELL IN THE FOUNTAIN AND AS IN A DIM AND DIZZY HAZE SAW FLOWERS AND TREES AND VASES OF THE COURTS HE REPEATED AGAIN THE MYSTIC WORD SO COMMON IN EVERY MOUTH YET OF SUCH FEARFUL POWERDEATH STRANGE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH A WORD HE SAID AND SUCH A THING AND WE EVER FORGET IT THAT ONE SHOULD BE LIVING WARM AND BEAUTIFUL FULL OF HOPES DESIRES AND WANTS ONE DAY AND THE NEXT BE GONE UTTERLY GONE AND FOREVER IT WAS A WARM GOLDEN EVENING AND AS HE WALKED TO THE OTHER END OF THE VERANDAH HE SAW TOM BUSILY INTENT ON HIS BIBLE POINTING AS HE DID SO WITH HIS FINGER TO EACH SUCCESSIVE WORD AND WHISPERING THEM TO HIMSELF WITH AN EARNEST AIR WANT ME TO READ TO YOU TOM SAID ST CLARE SEATING HIMSELF CARELESSLY BY HIM IF MASR PLEASES SAID TOM GRATEFULLY MASR MAKES IT SO MUCH PLAINER ST CLARE TOOK THE BOOK AND GLANCED AT THE PLACE AND BEGAN READING ONE OF THE PASSAGES WHICH TOM HAD DESIGNATED BY THE HEAVY MARKS AROUND IT IT RAN AS FOLLOWS WHEN THE SON OF MAN SHALL COME IN HIS GLORY AND ALL HIS HOLY ANGELS WITH HIM THEN SHALL HE SIT UPON THE THRONE OF HIS GLORY AND BEFORE HIM SHALL BE GATHERED ALL NATIONS AND HE SHALL SEPARATE THEM ONE FROM ANOTHER AS A SHEPHERD DIVIDETH HIS SHEEP FROM THE GOATS ST CLARE READ ON IN AN ANIMATED VOICE TILL HE CAME TO THE LAST OF THE VERSES THEN SHALL THE KING SAY UNTO HIM ON HIS LEFT HAND DEPART FROM ME YE CURSED INTO EVERLASTING FIRE FOR I WAS AN HUNGERED AND YE GAVE ME NO MEAT I WAS THIRSTY AND YE GAVE ME NO DRINK I

STRUCK WITH THIS LAST PASSAGE FOR HE READ IT TWICETHE SECOND TIME SLOWLY AND AS IF HE WERE REVOLVING THE WORDS IN HIS MIND TOM HE SAID THESE FOLKS THAT GET SUCH HARD MEASURE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DOING JUST WHAT I HAVELIVING GOOD EASY RESPECTABLE LIVES AND NOT TROUBLING THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE HOW MANY OF THEIR BRETHREN WERE HUNGRY OR ATHIRST OR SICK OR IN PRISON TOM DID NOT ANSWER ST CLARE ROSE UP AND WALKED THOUGHTFULLY UP AND DOWN THE VERANDAH SEEMING TO FORGET EVERYTHING IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS SO ABSORBED WAS HE THAT TOM HAD TO REMIND HIM TWICE THAT THE TEABELL HAD RUNG BEFORE HE COULD GET HIS ATTENTION ST CLARE WAS ABSENT AND THOUGHTFUL ALL TEATIME AFTER TEA HE AND MARIE AND MISS OPHELIA TOOK POSSESSION OF THE PARLOR ALMOST IN SILENCE MARIE DISPOSED HERSELF ON A LOUNGE UNDER A SILKEN MOSQUITO CURTAIN AND WAS SOON SOUND ASLEEP MISS OPHELIA SILENTLY BUSIED HERSELF WITH HER KNITTING ST CLARE SAT DOWN TO THE PIANO AND BEGAN PLAYING A SOFT AND MELANCHOLY MOVEMENT WITH THE OLIAN ACCOMPANIMENT HE SEEMED IN A DEEP REVERIE AND TO BE SOLILOQUIZING TO HIMSELF BY MUSIC AFTER A LITTLE HE OPENED ONE OF THE DRAWERS TOOK OUT AN OLD MUSICBOOK WHOSE LEAVES WERE YELLOW WITH AGE AND BEGAN TURNING IT OVER THERE HE SAID TO MISS OPHELIA THIS WAS ONE OF MY MOTHERS BOOKSAND HERE IS HER HANDWRITINGCOME AND LOOK AT IT SHE COPIED AND ARRANGED THIS FROM MOZARTS REQUIEM MISS OPHELIA CAME ACCORDINGLY IT WAS SOMETHING SHE USED TO SING OFTEN SAID ST CLARE I THINK I CAN HEAR HER NOW HE STRUCK A FEW MAJESTIC CHORDS AND BEGAN SINGING THAT GRAND OLD LATIN PIECE THE DIES IR TOM WHO WAS LISTENING IN THE OUTER VERANDAH WAS DRAWN BY THE SOUND TO THE VERY DOOR WHERE HE STOOD EARNESTLY HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORDS OF COURSE BUT THE MUSIC AND MANNER OF SINGING APPEARED TO AFFECT HIM STRONGLY ESPECIALLY WHEN ST CLARE SANG THE MORE PATHETIC PARTS TOM WOULD HAVE SYMPATHIZED MORE HEARTILY IF HE HAD KNOWN THE MEANING OF THE BEAUTIFUL WORDS RECORDARE JESU PIE QUOD SUM CAUSA TUR VI NE ME PERDAS ILLA DIE QURENS ME SEDISTI LASSUS REDEMISTI CRUCEM PASSUS TANTUS LABOR NON SIT CASSUS THESE LINES HAVE BEEN THUS RATHER INADEQUATELY TRANSLATED THINK O JESUS FOR WHAT REASON THOU ENDUREDST EARTHS SPITE AND TREASON NOR ME LOSE IN THAT DREAD SEASON SEEKING ME THY WORN FEET HASTED ON THE CROSS THY SOUL DEATH TASTED LET NOT ALL THESE TOILS BE WASTED MRS STOWES NOTE ST CLARE THREW A DEEP AND PATHETIC EXPRESSION INTO THE WORDS FOR THE SHADOWY VEIL OF YEARS SEEMED DRAWN AWAY AND HE SEEMED TO HEAR HIS MOTHERS VOICE LEADING HIS VOICE AND INSTRUMENT SEEMED BOTH LIVING AND THREW OUT WITH VIVID SYMPATHY THOSE STRAINS WHICH THE ETHEREAL MOZART FIRST CONCEIVED AS HIS OWN DYING REQUIEM WHEN ST CLARE HAD DONE SINGING HE SAT LEANING HIS HEAD UPON HIS HAND A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN BEGAN WALKING UP AND DOWN THE FLOOR WHAT A SUBLIME CONCEPTION IS THAT OF A LAST JUDGMENT SAID HEA RIGHTING OF ALL THE WRONGS OF AGESA SOLVING OF ALL MORAL PROBLEMS BY AN UNANSWERABLE WISDOM IT IS INDEED A WONDERFUL IMAGE IT IS A FEARFUL ONE TO US SAID MISS OPHELIA IT OUGHT TO BE TO ME I SUPPOSE SAID ST CLARE STOPPING THOUGHTFULLY I WAS READING TO TOM THIS AFTERNOON THAT CHAPTER IN MATTHEW THAT GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF IT AND I HAVE BEEN QUITE STRUCK WITH IT ONE SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED SOME TERRIBLE ENORMITIES CHARGED TO THOSE WHO ARE EXCLUDED FROM HEAVEN AS THE REASON BUT NOTHEY ARE CONDEMNED FOR NOT DOING POSITIVE GOOD AS IF THAT INCLUDED EVERY POSSIBLE HARM PERHAPS SAID MISS OPHELIA IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON WHO DOES NO GOOD NOT TO DO HARM AND WHAT SAID ST CLARE SPEAKING ABSTRACTEDLY BUT WITH DEEP FEELING WHAT SHALL BE SAID OF ONE WHOSE OWN HEART WHOSE EDUCATION AND THE WANTS OF SOCIETY HAVE CALLED IN VAIN TO SOME NOBLE PURPOSE WHO HAS FLOATED ON A DREAMY NEUTRAL SPECTATOR OF THE STRUGGLES AGONIES AND WRONGS OF MAN WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A WORKER I SHOULD SAY SAID MISS OPHELIA THAT HE OUGHT TO REPENT AND BEGIN NOW ALWAYS PRACTICAL AND TO THE POINT SAID ST CLARE HIS FACE BREAKING OUT INTO A SMILE YOU NEVER LEAVE ME ANY TIME FOR GENERAL REFLECTIONS COUSIN YOU ALWAYS BRING ME SHORT UP AGAINST THE ACTUAL PRESENT YOU HAVE A KIND OF ETERNAL NOW ALWAYS IN YOUR MIND NOW IS ALL THE TIME I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH SAID MISS OPHELIA DEAR LITTLE EVAPOOR CHILD SAID ST CLARE SHE HAD SET HER LITTLE SIMPLE SOUL ON A GOOD WORK FOR ME IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE EVAS DEATH THAT HE HAD EVER SAID AS MANY WORDS AS THESE TO HER AND HE SPOKE NOW EVIDENTLY REPRESSING VERY STRONG FEELING MY VIEW OF CHRISTIANITY IS SUCH HE ADDED THAT I THINK NO MAN CAN CONSISTENTLY PROFESS IT WITHOUT THROWING THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF HIS BEING AGAINST THIS MONSTROUS SYSTEM OF INJUSTICE THAT LIES AT THE FOUNDATION OF ALL OUR SOCIETY AND IF NEED BE SACRIFICING HIMSELF IN THE BATTLE THAT IS I MEAN THAT I COULD NOT BE A CHRISTIAN OTHERWISE THOUGH I HAVE CERTAINLY HAD INTERCOURSE WITH A GREAT MANY ENLIGHTENED AND CHRISTIAN PEOPLE WHO DID NO SUCH THING AND I CONFESS THAT THE APATHY OF RELIGIOUS PEOPLE ON THIS SUBJECT THEIR WANT OF PERCEPTION OF WRONGS THAT FILLED ME WITH HORROR HAVE ENGENDERED IN ME MORE SCEPTICISM THAN ANY OTHER THING IF YOU KNEW ALL THIS SAID MISS OPHELIA WHY DIDNT YOU DO IT O BECAUSE I HAVE HAD ONLY THAT KIND OF BENEVOLENCE WHICH CONSISTS IN LYING ON A SOFA AND CURSING THE CHURCH AND CLERGY FOR NOT BEING MARTYRS AND CONFESSORS ONE CAN SEE YOU KNOW VERY EASILY HOW OTHERS OUGHT TO BE MARTYRS WELL ARE YOU GOING TO DO DIFFERENTLY NOW SAID MISS OPHELIA GOD ONLY KNOWS THE FUTURE SAID ST CLARE I AM BRAVER THAN I WAS BECAUSE I HAVE LOST ALL AND HE WHO HAS NOTHING TO LOSE CAN AFFORD ALL RISKS AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO MY DUTY I HOPE TO THE POOR AND LOWLY AS FAST AS I FIND IT OUT SAID ST CLARE BEGINNING WITH MY OWN SERVANTS FOR WHOM I HAVE YET DONE NOTHING AND PERHAPS AT SOME FUTURE DAY IT MAY APPEAR THAT I CAN DO SOMETHING FOR A WHOLE CLASS SOMETHING TO SAVE MY COUNTRY FROM THE DISGRACE OF THAT FALSE POSITION IN WHICH SHE NOW STANDS BEFORE ALL CIVILIZED NATIONS DO YOU SUPPOSE IT POSSIBLE THAT A NATION EVER WILL VOLUNTARILY EMANCIPATE SAID MISS OPHELIA I DONT KNOW SAID ST CLARE THIS IS A DAY OF GREAT DEEDS HEROISM AND DISINTERESTEDNESS ARE RISING UP HERE AND THERE IN THE EARTH THE HUNGARIAN NOBLES SET FREE MILLIONS OF SERFS AT AN IMMENSE PECUNIARY LOSS AND PERHAPS AMONG US MAY BE FOUND GENEROUS SPIRITS WHO DO NOT ESTIMATE HONOR AND JUSTICE BY DOLLARS AND CENTS I HARDLY THINK SO SAID MISS OPHELIA BUT SUPPOSE WE SHOULD RISE UP TOMORROW AND EMANCIPATE WHO WOULD EDUCATE THESE MILLIONS AND TEACH THEM HOW TO USE THEIR FREEDOM THEY NEVER WOULD RISE TO DO MUCH AMONG US THE FACT IS WE ARE TOO LAZY AND UNPRACTICAL OURSELVES EVER TO GIVE THEM MUCH OF AN IDEA OF THAT INDUSTRY AND ENERGY WHICH IS NECESSARY TO FORM THEM INTO MEN THEY WILL HAVE TO GO NORTH WHERE LABOR IS THE FASHIONTHE UNIVERSAL CUSTOM AND TELL ME NOW IS THERE ENOUGH CHRISTIAN PHILANTHROPY AMONG YOUR NORTHERN STATES TO BEAR WITH THE PROCESS OF THEIR EDUCATION AND ELEVATION YOU SEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO FOREIGN MISSIONS BUT COULD YOU ENDURE TO HAVE THE HEATHEN SENT INTO YOUR TOWNS AND VILLAGES AND GIVE YOUR TIME AND THOUGHTS AND MONEY TO RAISE THEM TO THE CHRISTIAN STANDARD THATS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IF WE EMANCIPATE ARE YOU WILLING TO EDUCATE HOW MANY FAMILIES IN YOUR TOWN WOULD TAKE A NEGRO MAN AND WOMAN TEACH THEM BEAR WITH THEM AND SEEK TO MAKE THEM CHRISTIANS HOW MANY MERCHANTS WOULD TAKE ADOLPH IF I WANTED TO MAKE HIM A CLERK OR MECHANICS IF I WANTED HIM TAUGHT A TRADE IF I WANTED TO PUT JANE AND ROSA TO A SCHOOL HOW MANY SCHOOLS ARE THERE IN THE NORTHERN STATES THAT WOULD TAKE THEM IN HOW MANY FAMILIES THAT WOULD BOARD THEM AND YET THEY ARE AS WHITE AS MANY A WOMAN NORTH OR SOUTH YOU SEE COUSIN I WANT JUSTICE DONE US WE ARE IN A BAD POSITION WE ARE THE MORE OBVIOUS OPPRESSORS OF THE NEGRO BUT THE UNCHRISTIAN PREJUDICE OF THE NORTH IS AN OPPRESSOR ALMOST EQUALLY SEVERE WELL COUSIN I KNOW IT IS SO SAID MISS OPHELIAI KNOW IT WAS SO WITH ME TILL I SAW THAT IT WAS MY DUTY TO OVERCOME IT BUT I TRUST I HAVE OVERCOME IT AND I KNOW THERE ARE MANY GOOD PEOPLE AT THE NORTH WHO IN THIS MATTER NEED ONLY TO BE TAUGHT WHAT THEIR DUTY IS TO DO IT IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE A GREATER SELFDENIAL TO RECEIVE HEATHEN AMONG US THAN TO SEND MISSIONARIES TO THEM BUT I THINK WE WOULD DO IT YOU WOULD I KNOW SAID ST CLARE ID LIKE TO SEE ANYTHING YOU WOULDNT DO IF YOU THOUGHT IT YOUR DUTY WELL IM NOT UNCOMMONLY GOOD SAID MISS OPHELIA OTHERS WOULD IF THEY SAW THINGS AS I DO I INTEND TO TAKE TOPSY HOME WHEN I GO I SUPPOSE OUR FOLKS WILL WONDER AT FIRST BUT I THINK THEY WILL BE BROUGHT TO SEE AS I DO BESIDES I KNOW THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE AT THE NORTH WHO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID YES BUT THEY ARE A MINORITY AND IF WE SHOULD BEGIN TO EMANCIPATE TO ANY EXTENT WE SHOULD SOON HEAR FROM YOU MISS OPHELIA DID NOT REPLY THERE WAS A PAUSE OF SOME MOMENTS AND ST CLARES COUNTENANCE WAS OVERCAST BY A SAD DREAMY EXPRESSION I DONT KNOW WHAT MAKES ME THINK OF MY MOTHER SO MUCH TONIGHT HE SAID I HAVE A STRANGE KIND OF FEELING AS IF SHE WERE NEAR ME I KEEP THINKING OF THINGS SHE USED TO SAY STRANGE WHAT BRINGS THESE PAST THINGS SO VIVIDLY BACK TO US SOMETIMES ST CLARE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM FOR SOME MINUTES MORE AND THEN SAID I BELIEVE ILL GO DOWN STREET A FEW MOMENTS AND HEAR THE NEWS TONIGHT HE TOOK HIS HAT AND PASSED OUT TOM FOLLOWED HIM TO THE PASSAGE OUT OF THE COURT AND ASKED IF HE SHOULD ATTEND HIM NO MY BOY SAID ST CLARE I SHALL BE BACK IN AN HOUR TOM SAT DOWN IN THE VERANDAH IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT EVENING AND HE SAT WATCHING THE RISING AND FALLING SPRAY OF THE FOUNTAIN AND LISTENING TO ITS MURMUR TOM THOUGHT OF HIS HOME AND THAT HE SHOULD SOON BE A FREE MAN AND ABLE TO RETURN TO IT AT WILL HE THOUGHT HOW HE SHOULD WORK TO BUY HIS WIFE AND BOYS HE FELT THE MUSCLES OF HIS BRAWNY ARMS WITH A SORT OF JOY AS HE THOUGHT THEY WOULD SOON BELONG TO HIMSELF AND HOW MUCH THEY COULD DO TO WORK OUT THE FREEDOM OF HIS FAMILY THEN HE THOUGHT OF HIS NOBLE YOUNG MASTER AND EVER SECOND TO THAT CAME THE HABITUAL PRAYER THAT HE HAD ALWAYS OFFERED FOR HIM AND THEN HIS THOUGHTS PASSED ON TO THE BEAUTIFUL EVA WHOM HE NOW THOUGHT OF AMONG THE ANGELS AND HE THOUGHT TILL HE ALMOST FANCIED THAT THAT BRIGHT FACE AND GOLDEN HAIR WERE LOOKING UPON HIM OUT OF THE SPRAY OF THE FOUNTAIN AND SO MUSING HE FELL ASLEEP AND DREAMED HE SAW HER COMING BOUNDING TOWARDS HIM JUST AS SHE USED TO COME WITH A WREATH OF JESSAMINE IN HER HAIR HER CHEEKS BRIGHT AND HER EYES RADIANT WITH DELIGHT BUT AS HE LOOKED SHE SEEMED TO RISE FROM THE GROUND HER CHEEKS WORE A PALER HUEHER EYES HAD A DEEP DIVINE RADIANCE A GOLDEN HALO SEEMED AROUND HER HEADAND SHE VANISHED FROM HIS SIGHT AND TOM WAS AWAKENED BY A LOUD KNOCKING AND A SOUND OF MANY VOICES AT THE GATE HE HASTENED TO UNDO IT AND WITH SMOTHERED VOICES AND HEAVY TREAD CAME SEVERAL MEN BRINGING A BODY WRAPPED IN A CLOAK AND LYING ON A SHUTTER THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP FELL FULL ON THE FACE AND TOM GAVE A WILD CRY OF AMAZEMENT AND DESPAIR THAT RUNG THROUGH ALL THE GALLERIES AS THE MEN ADVANCED WITH THEIR BURDEN TO THE OPEN PARLOR DOOR WHERE MISS OPHELIA STILL SAT KNITTING ST CLARE HAD TURNED INTO A CAFE TO LOOK OVER AN EVENING PAPER AS HE WAS READING AN AFFRAY AROSE BETWEEN TWO GENTLEMEN IN THE ROOM WHO WERE BOTH PARTIALLY INTOXICATED ST CLARE AND ONE OR TWO OTHERS MADE AN EFFORT TO SEPARATE THEM AND ST CLARE RECEIVED A FATAL STAB IN THE SIDE WITH A BOWIEKNIFE WHICH HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO WREST FROM ONE OF THEM THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF CRIES AND LAMENTATIONS SHRIEKS AND SCREAMS SERVANTS FRANTICALLY TEARING THEIR HAIR THROWING THEMSELVES ON THE GROUND OR RUNNING DISTRACTEDLY ABOUT LAMENTING TOM AND MISS OPHELIA ALONE SEEMED TO HAVE ANY PRESENCE OF MIND FOR MARIE WAS IN STRONG HYSTERIC CONVULSIONS AT MISS OPHELIAS DIRECTION ONE OF THE LOUNGES IN THE PARLOR WAS HASTILY PREPARED AND THE BLEEDING FORM LAID UPON IT ST CLARE HAD FAINTED THROUGH PAIN AND LOSS OF BLOOD BUT AS MISS OPHELIA APPLIED RESTORATIVES HE REVIVED OPENED HIS EYES LOOKED FIXEDLY ON THEM LOOKED EARNESTLY AROUND THE ROOM HIS EYES TRAVELLING WISTFULLY OVER EVERY OBJECT AND FINALLY THEY RESTED ON HIS MOTHERS PICTURE THE PHYSICIAN NOW ARRIVED AND MADE HIS EXAMINATION IT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE BUT HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO DRESSING THE WOUND AND HE AND MISS OPHELIA AND TOM PROCEEDED COMPOSEDLY WITH THIS WORK AMID THE LAMENTATIONS AND SOBS AND CRIES OF THE AFFRIGHTED SERVANTS WHO HAD CLUSTERED ABOUT THE DOORS AND WINDOWS OF THE VERANDAH NOW SAID THE PHYSICIAN WE MUST TURN ALL THESE CREATURES OUT ALL DEPENDS ON HIS BEING KEPT QUIET ST CLARE OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED FIXEDLY ON THE DISTRESSED BEINGS WHOM MISS OPHELIA AND THE DOCTOR WERE TRYING TO URGE FROM THE APARTMENT POOR CREATURES HE SAID AND AN EXPRESSION OF BITTER SELFREPROACH PASSED OVER HIS FACE ADOLPH ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO GO TERROR HAD DEPRIVED HIM OF ALL PRESENCE OF MIND HE THREW HIMSELF ALONG THE FLOOR AND NOTHING COULD PERSUADE HIM TO RISE THE REST YIELDED TO MISS OPHELIAS URGENT REPRESENTATIONS THAT THEIR MASTERS SAFETY DEPENDED ON THEIR STILLNESS AND OBEDIENCE ST CLARE COULD SAY BUT LITTLE HE LAY WITH HIS EYES SHUT BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WRESTLED WITH BITTER THOUGHTS AFTER A WHILE HE LAID HIS HAND ON TOMS WHO WAS KNEELING BESIDE HIM AND SAID TOM POOR FELLOW WHAT MASR SAID TOM EARNESTLY I AM DYING SAID ST CLARE PRESSING HIS HAND PRAY IF YOU WOULD LIKE A CLERGYMAN SAID THE PHYSICIAN ST CLARE HASTILY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID AGAIN TO TOM MORE EARNESTLY PRAY AND TOM DID PRAY WITH ALL HIS MIND AND STRENGTH FOR THE SOUL THAT WAS PASSINGTHE SOUL THAT SEEMED LOOKING SO STEADILY AND MOURNFULLY FROM THOSE LARGE MELANCHOLY BLUE EYES IT WAS LITERALLY PRAYER OFFERED WITH STRONG CRYING AND TEARS WHEN TOM CEASED TO SPEAK ST CLARE REACHED OUT AND TOOK HIS HAND LOOKING EARNESTLY AT HIM BUT SAYING NOTHING HE CLOSED HIS EYES BUT STILL RETAINED HIS HOLD FOR IN THE GATES OF ETERNITY THE BLACK HAND AND THE WHITE HOLD EACH OTHER WITH AN EQUAL CLASP HE MURMURED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF AT BROKEN INTERVALS RECORDARE JESU PIE NE ME PERDASILLA DIE QURENS MESEDISTI LASSUS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE WORDS HE HAD BEEN SINGING THAT EVENING WERE PASSING THROUGH HIS MINDWORDS OF ENTREATY ADDRESSED TO INFINITE PITY HIS LIPS MOVED AT INTERVALS AS PARTS OF THE HYMN FELL BROKENLY FROM THEM HIS MIND IS WANDERING SAID THE DOCTOR NO IT IS COMING HOME AT LAST SAID ST CLARE ENERGETICALLY AT LAST AT LAST THE EFFORT OF SPEAKING EXHAUSTED HIM THE SINKING PALENESS OF DEATH FELL ON HIM BUT WITH IT THERE FELL AS IF SHED FROM THE WINGS OF SOME PITYING SPIRIT A BEAUTIFUL EXPRESSION OF PEACE LIKE THAT OF A WEARIED CHILD WHO SLEEPS SO HE LAY FOR A FEW MOMENTS THEY SAW THAT THE MIGHTY HAND WAS ON HIM JUST BEFORE THE SPIRIT PARTED HE OPENED HIS EYES WITH A SUDDEN LIGHT AS OF JOY AND RECOGNITION AND SAID MOTHER AND THEN HE WAS GONE CHAPTER XXIX THE UNPROTECTED WE HEAR OFTEN OF THE DISTRESS OF THE NEGRO SERVANTS ON THE LOSS OF A KIND MASTER AND WITH GOOD REASON FOR NO CREATURE ON GODS EARTH IS LEFT MORE UTTERLY UNPROTECTED AND DESOLATE THAN THE SLAVE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE CHILD WHO HAS LOST A FATHER HAS STILL THE PROTECTION OF FRIENDS AND OF THE LAW HE IS SOMETHING AND CAN DO SOMETHINGHAS ACKNOWLEDGED RIGHTS AND POSITION THE SLAVE HAS NONE THE LAW REGARDS HIM IN EVERY RESPECT AS DEVOID OF RIGHTS AS A BALE OF MERCHANDISE THE ONLY POSSIBLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ANY OF THE LONGINGS AND WANTS OF A HUMAN AND IMMORTAL CREATURE WHICH ARE GIVEN TO HIM COMES TO HIM THROUGH THE SOVEREIGN AND IRRESPONSIBLE WILL OF HIS MASTER AND WHEN THAT MASTER IS STRICKEN DOWN NOTHING REMAINS THE NUMBER OF THOSE MEN WHO KNOW HOW TO USE WHOLLY IRRESPONSIBLE POWER HUMANELY AND GENEROUSLY IS SMALL EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS AND THE SLAVE KNOWS IT BEST OF ALL SO THAT HE FEELS THAT THERE ARE TEN CHANCES OF HIS FINDING AN ABUSIVE AND TYRANNICAL MASTER TO ONE OF HIS FINDING A CONSIDERATE AND KIND ONE THEREFORE IS IT THAT THE WAIL OVER A KIND MASTER IS LOUD AND LONG AS WELL IT MAY BE WHEN ST CLARE BREATHED HIS LAST TERROR AND CONSTERNATION TOOK HOLD OF ALL HIS HOUSEHOLD HE HAD BEEN STRICKEN DOWN SO IN A MOMENT IN THE FLOWER AND STRENGTH OF HIS YOUTH EVERY ROOM AND GALLERY OF THE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH SOBS AND SHRIEKS OF DESPAIR MARIE WHOSE NERVOUS SYSTEM HAD BEEN ENERVATED BY A CONSTANT COURSE OF SELFINDULGENCE HAD NOTHING TO SUPPORT THE TERROR OF THE SHOCK AND AT THE TIME HER HUSBAND BREATHED HIS LAST WAS PASSING FROM ONE FAINTING FIT TO ANOTHER AND HE TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN JOINED IN THE MYSTERIOUS TIE OF MARRIAGE PASSED FROM HER FOREVER WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF EVEN A PARTING WORD MISS OPHELIA WITH CHARACTERISTIC STRENGTH AND SELFCONTROL HAD REMAINED WITH HER KINSMAN TO THE LASTALL EYE ALL EAR ALL ATTENTION DOING EVERYTHING OF THE LITTLE THAT COULD BE DONE AND JOINING WITH HER WHOLE SOUL IN THE TENDER AND IMPASSIONED PRAYERS WHICH THE POOR SLAVE HAD POURED FORTH FOR THE SOUL OF HIS DYING MASTER WHEN THEY WERE ARRANGING HIM FOR HIS LAST REST THEY FOUND UPON HIS BOSOM A SMALL PLAIN MINIATURE CASE OPENING WITH A SPRING IT WAS THE MINIATURE OF A NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL FEMALE FACE AND ON THE REVERSE UNDER A CRYSTAL A LOCK OF DARK HAIR THEY LAID THEM BACK ON THE LIFELESS BREASTDUST TO DUSTPOOR MOURNFUL RELICS OF EARLY DREAMS WHICH ONCE MADE THAT COLD HEART BEAT SO WARMLY TOMS WHOLE SOUL WAS FILLED WITH THOUGHTS OF ETERNITY AND WHILE HE MINISTERED AROUND THE LIFELESS CLAY HE DID NOT ONCE THINK THAT THE SUDDEN STROKE HAD LEFT HIM IN HOPELESS SLAVERY HE FELT AT PEACE ABOUT HIS MASTER FOR IN THAT HOUR WHEN HE HAD POURED FORTH HIS PRAYER INTO THE BOSOM OF HIS FATHER HE HAD FOUND AN ANSWER OF QUIETNESS AND ASSURANCE SPRINGING UP WITHIN HIMSELF IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS OWN AFFECTIONATE NATURE HE FELT ABLE TO PERCEIVE SOMETHING OF THE FULNESS OF DIVINE LOVE FOR AN OLD ORACLE HATH THUS WRITTENHE THAT DWELLETH IN LOVE DWELLETH IN GOD AND GOD IN HIM TOM HOPED AND TRUSTED AND WAS AT PEACE BUT THE FUNERAL PASSED WITH ALL ITS PAGEANT OF BLACK CRAPE AND PRAYERS AND SOLEMN FACES AND BACK ROLLED THE COOL MUDDY WAVES OF EVERYDAY LIFE AND UP CAME THE EVERLASTING HARD INQUIRY OF WHAT IS TO BE DONE NEXT IT ROSE TO THE MIND OF MARIE AS DRESSED IN LOOSE MORNINGROBES AND SURROUNDED BY ANXIOUS SERVANTS SHE SAT UP IN A GREAT EASYCHAIR AND INSPECTED SAMPLES OF CRAPE AND BOMBAZINE IT ROSE TO MISS OPHELIA WHO BEGAN TO TURN HER THOUGHTS TOWARDS HER NORTHERN HOME IT ROSE IN SILENT TERRORS TO THE MINDS OF THE SERVANTS WHO WELL KNEW THE UNFEELING TYRANNICAL CHARACTER OF THE MISTRESS IN WHOSE HANDS THEY WERE LEFT ALL KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE INDULGENCES WHICH HAD BEEN ACCORDED TO THEM WERE NOT FROM THEIR MISTRESS BUT FROM THEIR MASTER AND THAT NOW HE WAS GONE THERE WOULD BE NO SCREEN BETWEEN THEM AND EVERY TYRANNOUS INFLICTION WHICH A TEMPER SOURED BY AFFLICTION MIGHT DEVISE IT WAS ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTER THE FUNERAL THAT MISS OPHELIA BUSIED ONE DAY IN HER APARTMENT HEARD A GENTLE TAP AT THE DOOR SHE OPENED IT AND THERE STOOD ROSA THE PRETTY YOUNG QUADROON WHOM WE HAVE BEFORE OFTEN NOTICED HER HAIR IN DISORDER AND HER EYES SWELLED WITH CRYING O MISS FEELEY SHE SAID FALLING ON HER KNEES AND CATCHING THE SKIRT OF HER DRESS DO DO

FOR SHE FELT AS IF IT WAS PARTICULARLY DIRECTED TO HER MISS OPHELIA SAT FOR A MOMENT AS IF SHE HAD SWALLOWED SOME EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE AND WERE READY TO BURST THEN RECOLLECTING THE UTTER USELESSNESS OF CONTENTION WITH SUCH A NATURE SHE SHUT HER LIPS RESOLUTELY GATHERED HERSELF UP AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM IT WAS HARD TO GO BACK AND TELL ROSA THAT SHE COULD DO NOTHING FOR HER AND SHORTLY AFTER ONE OF THE MANSERVANTS CAME TO SAY THAT HER MISTRESS HAD ORDERED HIM TO TAKE ROSA WITH HIM TO THE WHIPPINGHOUSE WHITHER SHE WAS HURRIED IN SPITE OF HER TEARS AND ENTREATIES A FEW DAYS AFTER TOM WAS STANDING MUSING BY THE BALCONIES WHEN HE WAS JOINED BY ADOLPH WHO SINCE THE DEATH OF HIS MASTER HAD BEEN ENTIRELY CRESTFALLEN AND DISCONSOLATE ADOLPH KNEW THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN AN OBJECT OF DISLIKE

BOSOM AND CHOKED BACK THE BITTER TEARS AND TRIED TO PRAY THE POOR OLD SOUL HAD SUCH A SINGULAR UNACCOUNTABLE PREJUDICE IN FAVOR OF LIBERTY THAT IT WAS A HARD WRENCH FOR HIM AND THE MORE HE SAID THY WILL BE DONE THE WORSE HE FELT HE SOUGHT MISS OPHELIA WHO EVER SINCE EVAS DEATH HAD TREATED HIM WITH MARKED AND RESPECTFUL KINDNESS MISS FEELY HE SAID MASR ST CLARE PROMISED ME MY FREEDOM HE TOLD ME

HAVING DIED INSOLVENT IT HAD BEEN PURCHASED AT A BARGAIN BY LEGREE WHO USED IT AS HE DID EVERYTHING ELSE MERELY AS AN IMPLEMENT FOR MONEYMAKING THE PLACE HAD THAT RAGGED FORLORN APPEARANCE WHICH IS ALWAYS PRODUCED BY THE EVIDENCE THAT THE CARE OF THE FORMER OWNER HAS BEEN LEFT TO GO TO UTTER DECAY WHAT WAS ONCE A SMOOTHSHAVEN LAWN BEFORE THE HOUSE DOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH ORNAMENTAL SHRUBS WAS NOW COVERED WITH FROWSY TANGLED GRASS WITH HORSEPOSTS SET UP HERE AND THERE IN IT WHERE THE TURF WAS STAMPED AWAY AND THE GROUND LITTERED WITH BROKEN PAILS COBS OF CORN AND OTHER SLOVENLY REMAINS HERE AND THERE A MILDEWED JESSAMINE OR HONEYSUCKLE HUNG RAGGEDLY FROM SOME ORNAMENTAL SUPPORT WHICH HAD BEEN PUSHED TO ONE SIDE BY BEING USED AS A HORSEPOST WHAT ONCE WAS A LARGE GARDEN WAS NOW ALL GROWN

THE NEGRO MIND HAS BEEN MORE CRUSHED AND DEBASED THAN THE WHITE IT IS NO MORE TRUE OF THIS RACE THAN OF EVERY OPPRESSED RACE THE WORLD OVER THE SLAVE IS ALWAYS A TYRANT IF HE CAN GET A CHANCE TO BE ONE LEGREE LIKE SOME POTENTATES WE READ OF IN HISTORY GOVERNED HIS PLANTATION BY A SORT OF RESOLUTION OF FORCES SAMBO AND QUIMBO CORDIALLY HATED EACH OTHER THE PLANTATION HANDS ONE AND ALL CORDIALLY HATED THEM AND BY PLAYING OFF ONE AGAINST ANOTHER HE WAS PRETTY SURE THROUGH ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE THREE PARTIES TO GET INFORMED OF WHATEVER WAS ON FOOT IN THE PLACE NOBODY CAN LIVE ENTIRELY WITHOUT SOCIAL INTERCOURSE AND LEGREE ENCOURAGED HIS TWO BLACK SATELLITES TO A KIND OF COARSE FAMILIARITY WITH HIMA FAMILIARITY HOWEVER AT ANY MOMENT LIABLE TO GET ONE OR THE OTHER OF THEM INTO TROUBLE FOR ON THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION ONE OF THEM ALWAYS STOOD READY AT A NOD TO BE A MINISTER OF HIS VENGEANCE ON THE OTHER AS THEY STOOD THERE NOW BY LEGREE THEY SEEMED AN APT ILLUSTRATION OF THE FACT THAT

MOON ROSE IN THE PURPLE SKY AND LOOKED DOWN CALM AND SILENT AS GOD LOOKS ON THE SCENE OF MISERY AND OPPRESSIONLOOKED CALMLY ON THE LONE BLACK MAN AS HE SAT WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED AND HIS BIBLE ON HIS KNEE IS GOD HERE AH HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE UNTAUGHT HEART TO KEEP ITS FAITH UNSWERVING IN THE FACE OF DIRE MISRULE AND PALPABLE UNREBUKED INJUSTICE IN THAT SIMPLE HEART WAGED A FIERCE CONFLICT THE CRUSHING SENSE OF WRONG THE FORESHADOWING OF A WHOLE LIFE OF FUTURE MISERY THE WRECK OF ALL PAST HOPES MOURNFULLY TOSSING IN THE SOULS SIGHT LIKE DEAD CORPSES OF WIFE AND CHILD AND FRIEND RISING FROM THE DARK WAVE AND SURGING IN THE FACE OF THE HALFDROWNED MARINER AH WAS IT EASY HERE TO BELIEVE AND HOLD FAST THE GREAT PASSWORD OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THAT GOD IS AND IS THE REWARDER OF THEM THAT DILIGENTLY SEEK HIM TOM ROSE DISCONSOLATE AND STUMBLED INTO THE CABIN THAT HAD BEEN ALLOTTED TO HIM THE FLOOR WAS ALREADY STREWN WITH WEARY SLEEPERS AND THE FOUL AIR OF THE PLACE ALMOST REPELLED HIM BUT THE HEAVY NIGHTDEWS WERE CHILL AND HIS LIMBS WEARY AND WRAPPING ABOUT HIM A TATTERED BLANKET WHICH FORMED HIS ONLY BEDCLOTHING HE STRETCHED HIMSELF IN THE STRAW AND FELL ASLEEP IN DREAMS A GENTLE VOICE CAME OVER HIS EAR HE WAS SITTING ON THE MOSSY SEAT IN THE GARDEN BY LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN AND EVA WITH HER SERIOUS EYES BENT DOWNWARD WAS READING TO HIM FROM THE BIBLE AND HE HEARD HER READ WHEN THOU PASSEST THROUGH THE WATERS I WILL BE WITH THEE AND THE RIVERS THEY SHALL NOT OVERFLOW THEE WHEN THOU WALKEST THROUGH THE FIRE THOU SHALT NOT BE BURNED NEITHER SHALL THE FLAME KINDLE UPON THEE FOR I AM THE LORD THY GOD THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL THY SAVIOUR GRADUALLY THE WORDS SEEMED TO MELT AND FADE AS IN A DIVINE MUSIC THE CHILD RAISED HER DEEP EYES AND FIXED THEM LOVINGLY ON HIM AND RAYS OF WARMTH AND COMFORT SEEMED TO GO FROM THEM TO HIS HEART AND AS IF WAFTED ON THE MUSIC SHE SEEMED TO RISE ON SHINING WINGS FROM WHICH FLAKES AND SPANGLES OF GOLD FELL OFF LIKE STARS AND SHE WAS GONE TOM WOKE WAS IT A DREAM LET IT PASS FOR ONE BUT WHO SHALL SAY THAT THAT SWEET YOUNG SPIRIT WHICH IN LIFE SO YEARNED TO COMFORT AND CONSOLE THE DISTRESSED WAS FORBIDDEN OF GOD TO ASSUME THIS MINISTRY AFTER DEATH IT IS A BEAUTIFUL BELIEF THAT EVER ROUND OUR HEAD ARE HOVERING ON ANGEL WINGS THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD CHAPTER XXXIII CASSY AND BEHOLD THE TEARS OF SUCH AS WERE OPPRESSED AND THEY HAD NO COMFORTER AND ON THE SIDE OF THEIR OPPRESSORS THERE WAS POWER BUT THEY HAD NO COMFORTERECCL IT TOOK BUT A SHORT TIME TO FAMILIARIZE TOM WITH ALL THAT WAS TO BE HOPED OR FEARED IN HIS NEW WAY OF LIFE HE WAS AN EXPERT AND EFFICIENT WORKMAN IN WHATEVER HE UNDERTOOK AND WAS BOTH FROM HABIT AND PRINCIPLE PROMPT AND FAITHFUL QUIET AND PEACEABLE IN HIS DISPOSITION HE HOPED BY UNREMITTING DILIGENCE TO AVERT FROM HIMSELF AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE EVILS OF HIS CONDITION HE SAW ENOUGH OF ABUSE AND MISERY TO MAKE HIM SICK AND WEARY BUT HE DETERMINED TO TOIL ON WITH RELIGIOUS PATIENCE COMMITTING HIMSELF TO HIM THAT JUDGETH RIGHTEOUSLY NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT SOME WAY OF ESCAPE MIGHT YET BE OPENED TO HIM LEGREE TOOK A SILENT NOTE OF TOMS AVAILABILITY HE RATED HIM AS A FIRSTCLASS HAND AND YET HE FELT A SECRET DISLIKE TO HIMTHE NATIVE ANTIPATHY OF BAD TO GOOD HE SAW PLAINLY THAT WHEN AS WAS OFTEN THE CASE HIS VIOLENCE AND BRUTALITY FELL ON THE HELPLESS TOM TOOK NOTICE OF IT FOR SO SUBTLE IS THE ATMOSPHERE OF OPINION THAT IT WILL MAKE ITSELF FELT WITHOUT WORDS AND THE OPINION EVEN OF A SLAVE MAY ANNOY A MASTER TOM IN VARIOUS WAYS MANIFESTED A TENDERNESS OF FEELING A COMMISERATION FOR HIS FELLOWSUFFERERS STRANGE AND NEW TO THEM WHICH WAS WATCHED WITH A JEALOUS EYE BY LEGREE HE HAD PURCHASED TOM WITH A VIEW OF EVENTUALLY MAKING HIM A SORT OF OVERSEER WITH WHOM HE MIGHT AT TIMES INTRUST HIS AFFAIRS IN SHORT ABSENCES AND IN HIS VIEW THE FIRST SECOND AND THIRD REQUISITE FOR THAT PLACE WAS HARDNESS LEGREE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT AS TOM WAS NOT HARD TO HIS HAND HE WOULD HARDEN HIM FORTHWITH AND SOME FEW WEEKS AFTER TOM HAD BEEN ON THE PLACE HE DETERMINED TO COMMENCE THE PROCESS ONE MORNING WHEN THE HANDS WERE MUSTERED FOR THE FIELD TOM NOTICED WITH SURPRISE A NEW COMER AMONG THEM WHOSE APPEARANCE EXCITED HIS ATTENTION IT WAS A WOMAN TALL AND SLENDERLY FORMED WITH REMARKABLY DELICATE HANDS AND FEET AND DRESSED IN NEAT AND RESPECTABLE GARMENTS BY THE APPEARANCE OF HER FACE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETWEEN THIRTYFIVE AND FORTY AND IT WAS A FACE THAT ONCE SEEN COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTENONE OF THOSE THAT AT A GLANCE SEEM TO CONVEY TO US AN IDEA OF A WILD PAINFUL AND ROMANTIC HISTORY HER FOREHEAD WAS HIGH AND HER EYEBROWS MARKED WITH BEAUTIFUL CLEARNESS HER STRAIGHT WELLFORMED NOSE HER FINELYCUT MOUTH AND THE GRACEFUL CONTOUR OF HER HEAD AND NECK SHOWED THAT SHE MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL BUT HER FACE WAS DEEPLY WRINKLED WITH LINES OF PAIN AND OF PROUD AND BITTER ENDURANCE HER COMPLEXION WAS SALLOW AND UNHEALTHY HER CHEEKS THIN HER FEATURES SHARP AND HER WHOLE FORM EMACIATED BUT HER EYE WAS THE MOST REMARKABLE FEATURESO LARGE SO HEAVILY BLACK OVERSHADOWED BY LONG LASHES OF EQUAL DARKNESS AND SO WILDLY MOURNFULLY DESPAIRING THERE WAS A FIERCE PRIDE AND DEFIANCE IN EVERY LINE OF HER FACE IN EVERY CURVE OF THE FLEXIBLE LIP IN EVERY MOTION OF HER BODY BUT IN HER EYE WAS A DEEP SETTLED NIGHT OF ANGUISHAN EXPRESSION SO HOPELESS AND UNCHANGING AS TO CONTRAST FEARFULLY WITH THE SCORN AND PRIDE EXPRESSED BY HER WHOLE DEMEANOR WHERE SHE CAME FROM OR WHO SHE WAS TOM DID NOT KNOW THE FIRST HE DID KNOW SHE WAS WALKING BY HIS SIDE ERECT AND PROUD IN THE DIM GRAY OF THE DAWN TO THE GANG HOWEVER SHE WAS KNOWN FOR THERE WAS MUCH LOOKING AND TURNING OF HEADS AND A SMOTHERED YET APPARENT EXULTATION AMONG THE MISERABLE RAGGED HALFSTARVED CREATURES BY WHOM SHE WAS

WOMEN NEITHER LOOKED AT HIM NOR SPOKE TO HIM THOUGH ALL THE WAY TO THE FIELD SHE KEPT CLOSE AT HIS SIDE TOM WAS SOON BUSY AT HIS WORK BUT AS THE WOMAN WAS AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM HIM HE OFTEN GLANCED AN EYE TO HER AT HER WORK HE SAW AT A GLANCE THAT A NATIVE ADROITNESS AND HANDINESS MADE THE TASK TO HER AN EASIER ONE THAN IT PROVED TO MANY SHE PICKED VERY FAST AND VERY CLEAN AND WITH AN AIR OF SCORN AS IF SHE DESPISED BOTH THE WORK AND THE DISGRACE AND HUMILIATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH SHE WAS PLACED IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY TOM WAS WORKING NEAR THE MULATTO WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN BOUGHT IN THE SAME LOT WITH HIMSELF SHE WAS EVIDENTLY IN A CONDITION OF GREAT SUFFERING AND TOM OFTEN HEARD HER PRAYING AS SHE WAVERED AND TREMBLED AND SEEMED ABOUT TO FALL DOWN TOM SILENTLY AS HE

THE SECLUSION OF THE LADIES CABIN WHERE THE DARK BEAUTY OF THE SUPPOSED LITTLE GIRL DREW MANY FLATTERING COMMENTS FROM THE PASSENGERS GEORGE HAD THE SATISFACTION AS THE BELL RANG OUT ITS FAREWELL PEAL TO SEE MARKS WALK DOWN THE PLANK TO THE SHORE AND DREW A LONG SIGH OF RELIEF WHEN THE BOAT HAD PUT A RETURNLESS DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM IT WAS A SUPERB DAY THE BLUE WAVES OF LAKE ERIE DANCED RIPPLING AND SPARKLING IN THE SUNLIGHT A FRESH BREEZE BLEW FROM THE SHORE AND THE LORDLY BOAT PLOUGHED HER WAY RIGHT GALLANTLY ONWARD O WHAT AN UNTOLD WORLD THERE IS IN ONE HUMAN HEART WHO THOUGHT AS GEORGE WALKED CALMLY UP AND DOWN THE DECK OF THE STEAMER WITH HIS SHY COMPANION AT HIS SIDE OF ALL THAT WAS BURNING IN HIS BOSOM THE MIGHTY GOOD THAT SEEMED APPROACHING SEEMED TOO GOOD TOO FAIR EVEN TO BE A REALITY AND HE FELT A JEALOUS DREAD EVERY MOMENT OF THE DAY THAT SOMETHING WOULD RISE TO SNATCH IT FROM HIM BUT THE BOAT SWEPT ON HOURS FLEETED AND AT LAST CLEAR AND FULL ROSE THE BLESSED ENGLISH

SHORE THEY STOOD STILL TILL THE BOAT HAD CLEARED AND THEN WITH TEARS AND EMBRACINGS THE HUSBAND AND WIFE WITH THEIR WONDERING CHILD IN THEIR ARMS KNELT DOWN AND LIFTED UP THEIR HEARTS TO GOD T WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE BURST FROM DEATH TO LIFE FROM THE GRAVES CEREMENTS TO THE ROBES OF HEAVEN FROM SINS DOMINION AND FROM PASSIONS STRIFE TO THE PURE FREEDOM OF A SOUL FORGIVEN WHERE ALL THE BONDS OF DEATH AND HELL ARE RIVEN AND MORTAL PUTS ON IMMORTALITY WHEN MERCYS HAND HATH TURNED THE GOLDEN KEY AND MERCYS VOICE HATH SAID REJOICE THY SOUL IS FREE THE LITTLE PARTY WERE SOON GUIDED BY MRS SMYTH TO THE HOSPITABLE ABODE OF A GOOD MISSIONARY WHOM CHRISTIAN CHARITY HAS PLACED HERE AS A SHEPHERD TO THE OUTCAST AND WANDERING WHO ARE CONSTANTLY FINDING AN ASYLUM ON THIS SHORE WHO CAN SPEAK THE BLESSEDNESS OF THAT FIRST DAY OF FREEDOM IS NOT THE SENSE OF LIBERTY A HIGHER AND A FINER ONE THAN ANY OF THE FIVE TO MOVE SPEAK AND BREATHEGO OUT AND COME IN UNWATCHED AND FREE FROM DANGER WHO CAN SPEAK THE BLESSINGS OF THAT REST WHICH COMES DOWN ON THE FREE MANS PILLOW UNDER LAWS WHICH INSURE TO HIM THE RIGHTS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO MAN HOW FAIR AND PRECIOUS TO THAT MOTHER WAS THAT SLEEPING CHILDS FACE ENDEARED BY THE MEMORY OF A THOUSAND DANGERS HOW IMPOSSIBLE WAS IT TO SLEEP IN THE EXUBERANT POSSESSION OF SUCH BLESSEDNESS AND YET THESE TWO HAD NOT ONE ACRE OF GROUNDNOT A ROOF THAT THEY COULD CALL THEIR OWNTHEY HAD SPENT THEIR ALL TO THE LAST DOLLAR THEY HAD NOTHING MORE THAN THE BIRDS OF THE AIR OR THE FLOWERS OF THE FIELDYET THEY COULD NOT SLEEP FOR JOY O YE WHO TAKE FREEDOM FROM MAN WITH WHAT WORDS SHALL YE ANSWER IT TO GOD CHAPTER XXXVIII THE VICTORY THANKS BE UNTO GOD WHO GIVETH US THE VICTORY I COR HAVE NOT MANY OF US IN THE WEARY WAY OF LIFE FELT IN SOME HOURS HOW FAR EASIER IT WERE TO DIE THAN TO LIVE THE MARTYR WHEN FACED EVEN BY A DEATH OF BODILY ANGUISH AND HORROR FINDS IN THE VERY TERROR OF HIS DOOM A STRONG STIMULANT AND TONIC THERE IS A VIVID EXCITEMENT A THRILL AND FERVOR WHICH MAY CARRY THROUGH ANY CRISIS OF SUFFERING THAT IS THE BIRTHHOUR OF ETERNAL GLORY AND REST BUT TO LIVETO WEAR ON DAY AFTER DAY OF MEAN BITTER LOW HARASSING SERVITUDE EVERY NERVE DAMPENED AND DEPRESSED EVERY POWER OF FEELING GRADUALLY SMOTHEREDTHIS LONG AND WASTING HEARTMARTYRDOM THIS SLOW DAILY BLEEDING AWAY OF THE INWARD LIFE DROP BY DROP HOUR AFTER HOURTHIS IS THE TRUE SEARCHING TEST OF WHAT THERE MAY BE IN MAN OR WOMAN WHEN TOM STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH HIS PERSECUTOR AND HEARD HIS THREATS AND THOUGHT IN HIS VERY SOUL THAT HIS HOUR WAS COME HIS HEART SWELLED BRAVELY IN HIM AND HE THOUGHT HE COULD BEAR TORTURE AND FIRE BEAR ANYTHING WITH THE VISION OF JESUS AND HEAVEN BUT JUST A STEP BEYOND BUT WHEN HE WAS GONE AND THE PRESENT EXCITEMENT PASSED OFF CAME BACK THE PAIN OF HIS BRUISED AND WEARY LIMBSCAME BACK THE SENSE OF HIS UTTERLY DEGRADED HOPELESS FORLORN ESTATE AND THE DAY PASSED WEARILY ENOUGH LONG BEFORE HIS WOUNDS WERE HEALED LEGREE INSISTED THAT HE SHOULD BE PUT TO THE REGULAR FIELDWORK AND THEN CAME DAY AFTER DAY OF PAIN AND WEARINESS AGGRAVATED BY EVERY KIND OF INJUSTICE AND INDIGNITY THAT THE ILLWILL OF A MEAN AND MALICIOUS MIND COULD DEVISE WHOEVER IN OUR CIRCUMSTANCES HAS MADE TRIAL OF PAIN EVEN WITH ALL THE ALLEVIATIONS WHICH FOR US USUALLY ATTEND IT MUST KNOW THE IRRITATION THAT COMES WITH IT TOM NO LONGER WONDERED AT THE HABITUAL SURLINESS OF HIS ASSOCIATES NAY HE FOUND THE PLACID SUNNY TEMPER WHICH HAD BEEN THE HABITUDE OF HIS LIFE BROKEN IN ON AND SORELY STRAINED BY THE INROADS OF THE SAME THING HE HAD FLATTERED HIMSELF ON LEISURE TO READ HIS BIBLE BUT THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS LEISURE THERE IN THE HEIGHT OF THE SEASON LEGREE DID NOT HESITATE TO PRESS ALL HIS HANDS THROUGH SUNDAYS AND WEEKDAYS ALIKE WHY SHOULDNT HEHE MADE MORE COTTON BY IT AND GAINED HIS WAGER AND IF IT WORE OUT A FEW MORE HANDS HE COULD BUY BETTER ONES AT FIRST TOM USED TO READ A VERSE OR TWO OF HIS BIBLE BY THE FLICKER OF THE FIRE AFTER HE HAD RETURNED FROM HIS DAILY TOIL BUT AFTER THE CRUEL TREATMENT HE RECEIVED HE USED TO COME HOME SO EXHAUSTED THAT HIS HEAD SWAM AND HIS EYES FAILED WHEN HE TRIED TO READ AND HE WAS FAIN TO STRETCH HIMSELF DOWN WITH THE OTHERS IN UTTER EXHAUSTION IS IT STRANGE THAT THE RELIGIOUS PEACE AND TRUST WHICH HAD UPBORNE HIM HITHERTO SHOULD GIVE WAY TO TOSSINGS OF SOUL AND DESPONDENT DARKNESS THE GLOOMIEST PROBLEM OF THIS MYSTERIOUS LIFE WAS CONSTANTLY BEFORE HIS EYESSOULS CRUSHED AND RUINED EVIL TRIUMPHANT AND GOD SILENT IT WAS WEEKS AND MONTHS THAT TOM WRESTLED IN HIS OWN SOUL IN DARKNESS AND SORROW HE THOUGHT OF MISS OPHELIAS LETTER TO HIS KENTUCKY FRIENDS AND WOULD PRAY EARNESTLY THAT GOD WOULD SEND HIM DELIVERANCE AND THEN HE WOULD WATCH DAY AFTER DAY IN THE VAGUE HOPE OF SEEING SOMEBODY SENT TO REDEEM HIM AND WHEN NOBODY CAME HE WOULD CRUSH BACK TO HIS SOUL BITTER THOUGHTSTHAT IT WAS VAIN TO SERVE GOD THAT GOD HAD FORGOTTEN HIM HE SOMETIMES SAW CASSY AND SOMETIMES WHEN SUMMONED TO THE HOUSE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE DEJECTED FORM OF EMMELINE BUT HELD VERY LITTLE COMMUNION WITH EITHER IN FACT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR HIM TO COMMUNE WITH ANYBODY ONE EVENING HE WAS SITTING IN UTTER DEJECTION AND PROSTRATION BY A FEW DECAYING BRANDS WHERE HIS COARSE SUPPER WAS BAKING HE PUT A FEW BITS OF BRUSHWOOD ON THE FIRE AND STROVE TO RAISE THE LIGHT AND THEN DREW HIS WORN BIBLE FROM HIS POCKET THERE WERE ALL THE MARKED PASSAGES WHICH HAD THRILLED HIS SOUL SO OFTENWORDS OF PATRIARCHS AND SEERS POETS AND SAGES WHO FROM EARLY TIME HAD SPOKEN COURAGE TO MANVOICES FROM THE GREAT CLOUD OF WITNESSES WHO EVER SURROUND US IN THE RACE OF LIFE HAD THE WORD LOST ITS POWER OR COULD THE FAILING EYE AND WEARY SENSE NO LONGER ANSWER TO THE TOUCH OF THAT MIGHTY INSPIRATION HEAVILY SIGHING HE PUT IT IN HIS POCKET A COARSE LAUGH ROUSED HIM HE LOOKED UPLEGREE WAS STANDING OPPOSITE TO HIM WELL OLD BOY HE SAID YOU FIND YOUR RELIGION DONT WORK IT SEEMS I THOUGHT I SHOULD GET THAT THROUGH YOUR WOOL

DESPERATE EFFORT OF EVERY PHYSICAL AND MORAL NERVE TO THROW OFF THE WEIGHT AND HENCE THE HEAVIEST ANGUISH OFTEN PRECEDES A RETURN TIDE OF JOY AND COURAGE SO WAS IT NOW WITH TOM THE ATHEISTIC TAUNTS OF HIS CRUEL MASTER SUNK HIS BEFORE DEJECTED SOUL TO THE LOWEST EBB AND THOUGH THE HAND OF FAITH STILL HELD TO THE ETERNAL ROCK IT WAS A NUMB DESPAIRING GRASP TOM SAT LIKE ONE STUNNED AT THE FIRE SUDDENLY EVERYTHING AROUND HIM SEEMED TO FADE AND A VISION ROSE BEFORE HIM OF ONE CROWNED WITH THORNS BUFFETED AND BLEEDING TOM GAZED IN AWE AND WONDER AT THE MAJESTIC PATIENCE OF THE FACE THE DEEP

OF GLORY AND IN SPLENDOR INCONCEIVABLE HE SAW THAT SAME FACE BENDING COMPASSIONATELY TOWARDS HIM AND A VOICE SAID HE THAT OVERCOMETH SHALL SIT DOWN WITH ME ON MY THRONE EVEN AS I ALSO OVERCOME AND AM SET DOWN WITH MY FATHER ON HIS THRONE HOW LONG TOM LAY THERE HE KNEW NOT WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF THE FIRE WAS GONE OUT HIS CLOTHES WERE WET WITH THE CHILL AND DRENCHING DEWS BUT THE DREAD SOULCRISIS

THAT NIGHT AS HE WAS RETURNING HE THOUGHT HE WOULD TURN HIS HORSE AND RIDE ROUND THE QUARTERS AND SEE IF ALL WAS SAFE IT WAS A SUPERB MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND THE SHADOWS OF THE GRACEFUL CHINA TREES LAY MINUTELY PENCILLED ON THE TURF BELOW AND THERE WAS THAT TRANSPARENT STILLNESS IN THE AIR WHICH IT SEEMS ALMOST UNHOLY TO DISTURB LEGREE WAS A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE QUARTERS WHEN HE HEARD THE VOICE OF SOME ONE SINGING IT WAS NOT A USUAL SOUND THERE AND HE PAUSED TO LISTEN A MUSICAL TENOR VOICE SANG WHEN I CAN READ MY TITLE CLEAR TO MANSIONS IN THE SKIES ILL BID FAREWELL TO EVERY FEAR AND WIPE MY WEEPING EYES SHOULD EARTH AGAINST MY SOUL ENGAGE AND HELLISH DARTS BE HURLED THEN I CAN SMILE AT SATANS RAGE AND FACE A FROWNING WORLD LET CARES LIKE A WILD DELUGE COME AND STORMS OF SORROW FALL MAY I

SHUT YER OLD BLACK GASH AND GET ALONG IN WITH YOU YES MASR SAID TOM WITH READY CHEERFULNESS AS HE ROSE TO GO IN LEGREE WAS PROVOKED BEYOND MEASURE BY TOMS EVIDENT HAPPINESS AND RIDING UP TO HIM BELABORED HIM OVER HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS THERE YOU DOG HE SAID SEE IF YOULL FEEL SO COMFORTABLE AFTER THAT BUT THE BLOWS FELL NOW ONLY ON THE OUTER MAN AND NOT AS BEFORE ON THE HEART TOM STOOD PERFECTLY SUBMISSIVE AND YET LEGREE COULD NOT HIDE FROM HIMSELF THAT HIS POWER OVER HIS BOND THRALL WAS SOMEHOW GONE AND AS TOM DISAPPEARED IN HIS CABIN AND HE WHEELED HIS HORSE SUDDENLY ROUND THERE PASSED THROUGH HIS MIND ONE OF THOSE VIVID FLASHES THAT OFTEN SEND THE LIGHTNING OF CONSCIENCE ACROSS THE DARK AND WICKED SOUL HE UNDERSTOOD FULL WELL THAT IT WAS GOD WHO WAS STANDING BETWEEN HIM AND HIS VICTIM AND HE BLASPHEMED HIM THAT SUBMISSIVE AND SILENT MAN WHOM TAUNTS NOR THREATS NOR STRIPES NOR CRUELTIES COULD DISTURB ROUSED A VOICE WITHIN HIM SUCH AS OF OLD HIS MASTER ROUSED IN THE DEMONIAC SOUL SAYING WHAT HAVE WE TO DO WITH THEE THOU JESUS OF NAZARETHART THOU COME TO TORMENT US BEFORE THE TIME TOMS WHOLE SOUL OVERFLOWED WITH COMPASSION AND SYMPATHY FOR THE POOR WRETCHES BY WHOM HE WAS SURROUNDED TO HIM IT SEEMED AS IF HIS LIFESORROWS WERE NOW OVER AND AS IF OUT OF THAT STRANGE TREASURY OF PEACE AND JOY WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN ENDOWED FROM ABOVE HE LONGED TO POUR OUT SOMETHING FOR THE RELIEF OF THEIR WOES IT IS TRUE OPPORTUNITIES WERE SCANTY BUT ON THE WAY TO THE FIELDS AND BACK AGAIN AND DURING THE HOURS OF LABOR CHANCES FELL IN HIS WAY OF EXTENDING A HELPINGHAND TO THE WEARY THE DISHEARTENED AND DISCOURAGED THE POOR WORNDOWN BRUTALIZED CREATURES AT FIRST COULD SCARCE COMPREHEND THIS BUT WHEN IT WAS CONTINUED WEEK AFTER WEEK AND MONTH AFTER MONTH IT BEGAN TO AWAKEN LONGSILENT CHORDS IN THEIR BENUMBED HEARTS GRADUALLY AND IMPERCEPTIBLY THE STRANGE SILENT PATIENT MAN WHO WAS READY TO BEAR EVERY ONES BURDEN AND SOUGHT HELP FROM NONEWHO STOOD ASIDE FOR ALL AND CAME LAST AND TOOK LEAST YET WAS FOREMOST TO SHARE HIS LITTLE ALL WITH ANY WHO NEEDEDTHE MAN WHO IN COLD NIGHTS WOULD GIVE UP HIS TATTERED BLANKET TO ADD TO THE COMFORT OF SOME WOMAN WHO SHIVERED WITH SICKNESS AND WHO FILLED THE BASKETS OF THE WEAKER ONES IN THE FIELD AT THE TERRIBLE RISK OF COMING SHORT IN HIS OWN MEASUREAND WHO THOUGH PURSUED WITH UNRELENTING CRUELTY BY THEIR COMMON TYRANT NEVER JOINED IN UTTERING A WORD OF REVILING OR CURSINGTHIS MAN AT LAST BEGAN TO HAVE A STRANGE POWER OVER THEM AND WHEN THE MORE PRESSING SEASON WAS PAST AND THEY WERE ALLOWED AGAIN THEIR SUNDAYS FOR THEIR OWN USE MANY WOULD GATHER TOGETHER TO HEAR FROM HIM OF JESUS THEY WOULD GLADLY HAVE MET TO HEAR AND PRAY AND SING IN SOME PLACE TOGETHER BUT LEGREE WOULD NOT PERMIT IT AND MORE THAN ONCE BROKE UP SUCH ATTEMPTS WITH OATHS AND BRUTAL EXECRATIONSSO THAT THE BLESSED NEWS HAD TO CIRCULATE FROM INDIVIDUAL TO INDIVIDUAL YET WHO CAN SPEAK THE SIMPLE JOY WITH WHICH SOME OF THOSE POOR OUTCASTS TO WHOM LIFE WAS A JOYLESS JOURNEY TO A DARK UNKNOWN HEARD OF A COMPASSIONATE REDEEMER AND A HEAVENLY HOME IT IS THE STATEMENT OF MISSIONARIES THAT OF ALL RACES OF THE EARTH NONE HAVE RECEIVED THE GOSPEL WITH SUCH EAGER DOCILITY AS THE AFRICAN THE PRINCIPLE OF RELIANCE AND UNQUESTIONING FAITH WHICH IS ITS FOUNDATION IS MORE A NATIVE ELEMENT IN THIS RACE THAN ANY OTHER AND IT HAS OFTEN BEEN FOUND AMONG

MULATTO WOMAN WHOSE SIMPLE FAITH HAD BEEN WELLNIGH CRUSHED AND OVERWHELMED BY THE AVALANCHE OF CRUELTY AND WRONG WHICH HAD FALLEN UPON HER FELT HER SOUL RAISED UP BY THE HYMNS AND PASSAGES OF HOLY

SIMPLE AND UNOBTRUSIVE INFLUENCES STUNG TO MADNESS AND DESPAIR BY THE CRUSHING AGONIES OF A LIFE CASSY HAD OFTEN RESOLVED IN HER SOUL AN HOUR OF RETRIBUTION WHEN HER HAND SHOULD AVENGE ON HER

AND FEASIBLE IN ALL ITS DETAILS AS TO AWAKEN AN INSTANT HOPE FATHER TOM ILL TRY IT SHE SAID SUDDENLY AMEN SAID TOM THE LORD HELP YE CHAPTER XXXIX THE STRATAGEM THE WAY OF THE WICKED IS AS DARKNESS HE KNOWETH NOT AT WHAT HE STUMBLETH PROV THE GARRET OF THE HOUSE THAT LEGREE OCCUPIED LIKE MOST OTHER GARRETS WAS A GREAT DESOLATE SPACE DUSTY HUNG WITH COBWEBS AND LITTERED WITH CASTOFF LUMBER THE OPULENT FAMILY THAT HAD INHABITED THE HOUSE IN THE DAYS OF ITS SPLENDOR HAD IMPORTED A GREAT DEAL OF SPLENDID FURNITURE SOME OF WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN AWAY WITH THEM WHILE SOME REMAINED STANDING DESOLATE IN MOULDERING UNOCCUPIED ROOMS OR STORED AWAY IN THIS PLACE ONE OR TWO IMMENSE PACKINGBOXES IN WHICH THIS FURNITURE WAS BROUGHT STOOD AGAINST THE SIDES OF THE GARRET THERE WAS A SMALL WINDOW THERE WHICH LET IN THROUGH ITS DINGY DUSTY PANES A SCANTY UNCERTAIN LIGHT ON THE TALL HIGHBACKED CHAIRS AND DUSTY TABLES THAT HAD ONCE SEEN BETTER DAYS ALTOGETHER IT WAS A WEIRD AND GHOSTLY PLACE BUT GHOSTLY AS IT WAS IT WANTED NOT IN LEGENDS AMONG THE SUPERSTITIOUS NEGROES TO INCREASE ITS TERRORS SOME FEW YEARS BEFORE A NEGRO WOMAN WHO HAD INCURRED LEGREES DISPLEASURE WAS CONFINED THERE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WHAT PASSED THERE WE DO NOT SAY THE NEGROES USED TO WHISPER DARKLY TO EACH OTHER BUT IT WAS KNOWN THAT THE BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE CREATURE WAS ONE DAY TAKEN DOWN FROM THERE AND BURIED AND AFTER THAT IT WAS SAID THAT OATHS AND CURSINGS AND THE SOUND OF VIOLENT BLOWS USED TO RING THROUGH THAT OLD GARRET AND MINGLED WITH WAILINGS AND GROANS OF DESPAIR ONCE WHEN LEGREE CHANCED TO OVERHEAR SOMETHING OF THIS KIND HE FLEW INTO A VIOLENT PASSION AND SWORE THAT THE NEXT ONE THAT TOLD STORIES ABOUT THAT GARRET SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF KNOWING WHAT WAS THERE FOR HE WOULD CHAIN THEM UP THERE FOR A WEEK THIS HINT WAS ENOUGH TO REPRESS TALKING THOUGH OF COURSE IT DID NOT DISTURB THE CREDIT OF THE STORY IN THE LEAST GRADUALLY THE STAIRCASE THAT LED TO THE GARRET AND EVEN THE PASSAGEWAY TO THE STAIRCASE WERE AVOIDED BY EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE FROM EVERY ONE FEARING TO SPEAK OF IT AND THE LEGEND WAS GRADUALLY FALLING INTO DESUETUDE IT HAD SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO CASSY TO MAKE USE OF THE SUPERSTITIOUS EXCITABILITY WHICH WAS SO GREAT IN LEGREE FOR THE PURPOSE OF HER LIBERATION AND THAT OF HER FELLOWSUFFERER THE SLEEPINGROOM OF CASSY WAS DIRECTLY UNDER THE GARRET ONE DAY WITHOUT CONSULTING LEGREE SHE SUDDENLY TOOK IT UPON HER WITH SOME CONSIDERABLE OSTENTATION TO CHANGE ALL THE FURNITURE AND APPURTENANCES OF THE ROOM TO ONE AT SOME CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE THE UNDERSERVANTS WHO WERE CALLED ON TO EFFECT THIS MOVEMENT WERE RUNNING AND BUSTLING ABOUT WITH GREAT ZEAL AND CONFUSION WHEN LEGREE RETURNED FROM A RIDE HALLO YOU CASS SAID LEGREE WHATS IN THE WIND NOW NOTHING ONLY I CHOOSE TO HAVE ANOTHER ROOM SAID CASSY DOGGEDLY AND WHAT FOR PRAY SAID LEGREE I CHOOSE TO SAID CASSY THE DEVIL YOU DO AND WHAT FOR ID LIKE TO GET SOME SLEEP NOW AND THEN SLEEP WELL WHAT HINDERS YOUR SLEEPING I COULD TELL I SUPPOSE IF YOU WANT TO HEAR SAID CASSY DRYLY SPEAK OUT YOU MINX SAID LEGREE O NOTHING I SUPPOSE IT WOULDNT DISTURB YOU ONLY GROANS AND PEOPLE SCUFFING AND ROLLING ROUND ON THE GARRET FLOOR HALF THE NIGHT FROM TWELVE TO MORNING PEOPLE UP GARRET SAID LEGREE UNEASILY BUT FORCING A LAUGH WHO ARE THEY CASSY CASSY RAISED HER SHARP BLACK EYES AND LOOKED IN THE FACE OF LEGREE WITH AN EXPRESSION THAT WENT THROUGH HIS BONES AS SHE SAID TO BE SURE SIMON WHO ARE THEY ID LIKE TO HAVE YOU TELL ME YOU DONT KNOW I SUPPOSE WITH AN OATH LEGREE STRUCK AT HER WITH HIS RIDINGWHIP BUT SHE GLIDED TO ONE SIDE AND PASSED THROUGH THE DOOR AND LOOKING BACK SAID IF YOULL SLEEP IN THAT ROOM YOULL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT PERHAPS YOUD BETTER TRY IT AND THEN IMMEDIATELY SHE SHUT AND LOCKED THE DOOR LEGREE BLUSTERED AND SWORE AND THREATENED TO BREAK DOWN THE DOOR BUT APPARENTLY THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND WALKED UNEASILY INTO THE SITTINGROOM CASSY PERCEIVED THAT HER SHAFT HAD STRUCK HOME AND FROM THAT HOUR WITH THE MOST EXQUISITE ADDRESS SHE NEVER CEASED TO CONTINUE THE TRAIN OF INFLUENCES SHE HAD BEGUN IN A KNOTHOLE OF THE GARRET THAT HAD OPENED SHE HAD INSERTED THE NECK OF AN OLD BOTTLE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WHEN THERE WAS THE LEAST WIND MOST DOLEFUL AND LUGUBRIOUS WAILING SOUNDS PROCEEDED FROM IT WHICH IN A HIGH WIND INCREASED TO A PERFECT SHRIEK SUCH AS TO CREDULOUS AND SUPERSTITIOUS EARS MIGHT EASILY SEEM TO BE THAT OF HORROR AND DESPAIR THESE SOUNDS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME HEARD BY THE SERVANTS AND REVIVED IN FULL FORCE THE MEMORY OF THE OLD GHOST LEGEND A SUPERSTITIOUS CREEPING HORROR SEEMED TO FILL THE HOUSE AND THOUGH NO ONE DARED TO BREATHE IT TO LEGREE HE FOUND HIMSELF ENCOMPASSED BY IT AS BY AN ATMOSPHERE NO ONE IS SO THOROUGHLY SUPERSTITIOUS AS THE GODLESS MAN THE CHRISTIAN IS COMPOSED BY THE BELIEF OF A WISE ALLRULING FATHER WHOSE PRESENCE FILLS THE VOID UNKNOWN WITH LIGHT AND ORDER BUT TO THE MAN WHO HAS DETHRONED GOD THE SPIRITLAND IS INDEED IN THE WORDS OF THE HEBREW POET A LAND OF DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF DEATH WITHOUT ANY ORDER WHERE THE LIGHT IS AS DARKNESS LIFE AND DEATH TO HIM ARE HAUNTED GROUNDS FILLED WITH GOBLIN FORMS OF VAGUE AND SHADOWY DREAD LEGREE HAD HAD THE SLUMBERING MORAL ELEMENTS IN HIM ROUSED BY HIS ENCOUNTERS WITH TOMROUSED ONLY TO BE RESISTED BY THE DETERMINATE FORCE OF EVIL BUT STILL THERE WAS A THRILL AND COMMOTION OF THE DARK INNER WORLD PRODUCED BY EVERY WORD OR PRAYER OR HYMN THAT REACTED IN SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD THE INFLUENCE OF CASSY OVER HIM WAS OF A STRANGE AND SINGULAR KIND HE WAS HER OWNER HER TYRANT AND TORMENTOR SHE WAS AS HE KNEW WHOLLY AND WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF HELP OR REDRESS IN HIS HANDS AND YET SO IT IS THAT THE MOST BRUTAL MAN CANNOT LIVE IN CONSTANT ASSOCIATION WITH A STRONG FEMALE INFLUENCE AND NOT BE GREATLY CONTROLLED BY IT WHEN HE FIRST BOUGHT HER SHE WAS AS SHE SAID A WOMAN DELICATELY BRED AND THEN HE CRUSHED HER WITHOUT SCRUPLE BENEATH THE FOOT OF HIS BRUTALITY BUT AS TIME AND DEBASING INFLUENCES AND DESPAIR HARDENED WOMANHOOD WITHIN HER AND WAKED THE FIRES OF FIERCER PASSIONS SHE HAD BECOME IN A MEASURE HIS MISTRESS AND HE ALTERNATELY TYRANNIZED OVER AND DREADED HER THIS INFLUENCE HAD BECOME MORE HARASSING AND DECIDED SINCE PARTIAL INSANITY HAD GIVEN A STRANGE WEIRD UNSETTLED CAST TO ALL HER WORDS AND LANGUAGE A NIGHT OR TWO AFTER THIS LEGREE WAS SITTING IN THE OLD SITTINGROOM BY THE SIDE OF A FLICKERING WOOD FIRE THAT THREW UNCERTAIN GLANCES ROUND THE ROOM IT WAS A STORMY WINDY NIGHT SUCH AS RAISES WHOLE SQUADRONS OF NONDESCRIPT NOISES IN RICKETY OLD HOUSES WINDOWS WERE RATTLING SHUTTERS FLAPPING AND WIND CAROUSING RUMBLING AND TUMBLING DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE PUFFING OUT SMOKE AND ASHES AS IF A LEGION OF SPIRITS WERE COMING AFTER THEM LEGREE HAD BEEN CASTING UP ACCOUNTS AND READING NEWSPAPERS FOR SOME HOURS WHILE CASSY SAT IN THE CORNER SULLENLY LOOKING INTO THE FIRE LEGREE LAID DOWN HIS PAPER AND SEEING AN OLD BOOK LYING ON THE TABLE WHICH HE HAD NOTICED CASSY READING THE FIRST PART OF THE EVENING TOOK IT UP AND BEGAN TO TURN IT OVER IT WAS ONE OF THOSE COLLECTIONS OF STORIES OF BLOODY MURDERS GHOSTLY LEGENDS AND SUPERNATURAL VISITATIONS WHICH COARSELY GOT UP AND ILLUSTRATED HAVE A STRANGE FASCINATION FOR ONE WHO ONCE BEGINS TO READ THEM LEGREE POOHED AND PISHED BUT READ TURNING PAGE AFTER PAGE TILL FINALLY AFTER READING SOME WAY HE THREW DOWN THE BOOK WITH AN OATH YOU DONT BELIEVE IN GHOSTS DO YOU CASS SAID HE TAKING THE TONGS AND SETTLING THE FIRE I THOUGHT YOUD MORE SENSE THAN TO LET NOISES SCARE YOU NO MATTER WHAT I BELIEVE SAID CASSY SULLENLY FELLOWS USED TO TRY TO FRIGHTEN ME WITH THEIR YARNS AT SEA SAID LEGREE NEVER COME IT ROUND ME THAT WAY IM TOO TOUGH FOR ANY SUCH TRASH TELL YE CASSY SAT LOOKING INTENSELY AT HIM IN THE SHADOW OF THE CORNER THERE WAS THAT STRANGE LIGHT IN HER EYES THAT ALWAYS IMPRESSED LEGREE WITH UNEASINESS THEM NOISES WAS NOTHING BUT RATS AND THE WIND SAID LEGREE RATS WILL MAKE A DEVIL OF A NOISE I USED TO HEAR EM SOMETIMES DOWN IN THE HOLD OF THE SHIP AND WINDLORDS SAKE YE CAN MAKE ANYTHING OUT O WIND CASSY KNEW LEGREE WAS UNEASY UNDER HER EYES AND THEREFORE SHE MADE NO ANSWER BUT SAT FIXING THEM ON HIM WITH THAT STRANGE UNEARTHLY EXPRESSION AS BEFORE COME SPEAK OUT WOMANDONT YOU THINK SO SAID LEGREE CAN RATS WALK DOWN STAIRS AND COME WALKING THROUGH THE ENTRY AND OPEN A DOOR WHEN YOUVE LOCKED IT AND SET A CHAIR AGAINST IT SAID CASSY AND COME WALK WALK WALKING RIGHT UP TO YOUR BED AND PUT OUT THEIR HAND SO CASSY KEPT HER GLITTERING EYES FIXED ON LEGREE AS SHE SPOKE AND HE STARED AT HER LIKE A MAN IN THE NIGHTMARE TILL WHEN SHE FINISHED BY LAYING HER HAND ICY COLD ON HIS HE SPRUNG BACK WITH AN OATH WOMAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOBODY DID O NOOF COURSE NOTDID I SAY THEY DID SAID CASSY WITH A SMILE OF CHILLING DERISION BUTDIDHAVE YOU REALLY SEENCOME CASS WHAT IS IT NOWSPEAK OUT YOU MAY SLEEP THERE YOURSELF SAID CASSY IF YOU WANT TO

THING EXAMINED ILL LOOK INTO IT THIS VERY NIGHT ILL TAKE MY PISTOLS DO SAID CASSY SLEEP IN THAT ROOM ID LIKE TO SEE YOU DOING IT FIRE YOUR PISTOLSDO LEGREE STAMPED HIS FOOT AND SWORE VIOLENTLY DONT SWEAR SAID CASSY NOBODY KNOWS WHO MAY BE HEARING YOU HARK WHAT WAS THAT WHAT SAID LEGREE STARTING A HEAVY OLD DUTCH CLOCK THAT STOOD IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM BEGAN AND SLOWLY STRUCK TWELVE FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER LEGREE NEITHER SPOKE NOR MOVED A VAGUE HORROR FELL ON HIM WHILE CASSY WITH A KEEN SNEERING GLITTER IN HER EYES STOOD LOOKING AT HIM COUNTING THE STROKES TWELVE OCLOCK WELL NOW WELL SEE SAID SHE TURNING AND OPENING THE DOOR INTO THE PASSAGEWAY AND STANDING AS IF LISTENING HARK WHATS THAT SAID SHE RAISING HER FINGER ITS ONLY THE WIND SAID LEGREE DONT YOU HEAR HOW CURSEDLY IT BLOWS SIMON COME HERE SAID CASSY IN A WHISPER LAYING HER HAND ON HIS AND LEADING HIM TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS HARK A WILD SHRIEK CAME PEALING DOWN THE STAIRWAY IT CAME FROM THE GARRET LEGREES KNEES KNOCKED TOGETHER HIS FACE GREW WHITE WITH FEAR HADNT YOU BETTER GET YOUR PISTOLS SAID CASSY WITH A SNEER THAT FROZE LEGREES BLOOD ITS TIME THIS THING WAS LOOKED INTO YOU KNOW ID

AFTER HIM COME ON I BELIEVE YOU ARE THE DEVIL SAID LEGREE COME BACK YOU HAGCOME BACK CASS YOU SHANT GO BUT CASSY LAUGHED WILDLY AND FLED ON HE HEARD HER OPEN THE ENTRY DOORS THAT LED TO THE GARRET A WILD GUST OF WIND SWEPT DOWN EXTINGUISHING THE CANDLE HE HELD IN HIS HAND AND WITH IT THE FEARFUL UNEARTHLY SCREAMS THEY SEEMED TO BE SHRIEKED IN HIS VERY EAR LEGREE FLED FRANTICALLY INTO THE PARLOR WHITHER IN A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS FOLLOWED BY CASSY PALE CALM COLD AS AN AVENGING SPIRIT AND WITH THAT SAME FEARFUL LIGHT IN HER EYE I HOPE YOU ARE SATISFIED SAID SHE BLAST YOU CASS SAID LEGREE WHAT FOR SAID CASSY I ONLY WENT UP AND SHUT THE DOORS WHATS THE MATTER WITH THAT GARRET SIMON DO YOU SUPPOSE SAID SHE NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS SAID LEGREE O IT ANT WELL SAID CASSY AT ANY RATE IM GLAD I DONT SLEEP UNDER IT ANTICIPATING THE RISING OF THE WIND THAT VERY EVENING CASSY HAD BEEN UP AND OPENED THE GARRET WINDOW OF COURSE THE MOMENT THE DOORS WERE OPENED THE WIND HAD DRAFTED DOWN AND EXTINGUISHED THE LIGHT THIS MAY SERVE AS A SPECIMEN OF THE GAME THAT CASSY PLAYED WITH LEGREE UNTIL HE WOULD SOONER HAVE PUT HIS HEAD INTO A LIONS MOUTH THAN TO HAVE EXPLORED THAT GARRET MEANWHILE IN THE NIGHT WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS ASLEEP CASSY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY ACCUMULATED THERE A STOCK OF PROVISIONS SUFFICIENT TO AFFORD SUBSISTENCE FOR SOME TIME SHE TRANSFERRED ARTICLE BY ARTICLE A GREATER PART OF HER OWN AND EMMELINES WARDROBE ALL THINGS BEING ARRANGED THEY ONLY WAITED A FITTING OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THEIR PLAN IN EXECUTION BY CAJOLING LEGREE AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A GOODNATURED INTERVAL CASSY HAD GOT HIM TO TAKE HER WITH HIM TO THE NEIGHBORING TOWN WHICH WAS SITUATED DIRECTLY ON THE RED RIVER WITH A MEMORY SHARPENED TO ALMOST PRETERNATURAL CLEARNESS SHE REMARKED EVERY TURN IN THE ROAD AND FORMED A MENTAL ESTIMATE OF THE TIME TO BE OCCUPIED IN TRAVERSING IT AT THE TIME WHEN ALL WAS MATURED FOR ACTION OUR READERS MAY PERHAPS LIKE TO LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES AND SEE THE FINAL COUP DTAT IT WAS NOW NEAR EVENING LEGREE HAD BEEN ABSENT ON A RIDE TO A NEIGHBORING FARM FOR MANY DAYS CASSY HAD BEEN UNUSUALLY GRACIOUS AND ACCOMMODATING IN HER HUMORS AND LEGREE AND SHE HAD BEEN APPARENTLY ON THE BEST OF TERMS AT PRESENT WE MAY BEHOLD HER AND EMMELINE IN THE ROOM OF THE LATTER BUSY IN SORTING AND ARRANGING TWO SMALL BUNDLES THERE THESE WILL BE LARGE ENOUGH SAID CASSY NOW PUT ON YOUR BONNET AND LETS

SPARK TO A POWDER MAGAZINE PRUDENCE WAS NEVER A CARDINAL VIRTUE OF THE KENTUCKY BOY GEORGE TURNED AND WITH ONE INDIGNANT BLOW KNOCKED LEGREE FLAT UPON HIS FACE AND AS HE STOOD OVER HIM BLAZING WITH WRATH AND DEFIANCE HE WOULD HAVE FORMED NO BAD PERSONIFICATION OF HIS GREAT NAMESAKE TRIUMPHING OVER THE DRAGON SOME MEN HOWEVER ARE DECIDEDLY BETTERED BY BEING KNOCKED DOWN IF A MAN LAYS THEM FAIRLY FLAT IN THE DUST THEY SEEM IMMEDIATELY TO CONCEIVE A RESPECT FOR HIM AND LEGREE WAS ONE OF THIS SORT AS HE ROSE THEREFORE AND BRUSHED THE DUST FROM HIS CLOTHES HE EYED THE SLOWLYRETREATING WAGON WITH SOME EVIDENT CONSIDERATION NOR DID HE OPEN HIS MOUTH TILL IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PLANTATION GEORGE HAD NOTICED A DRY SANDY KNOLL SHADED BY A FEW TREES THERE THEY MADE THE GRAVE SHALL WE TAKE OFF THE CLOAK MASR SAID THE NEGROES WHEN THE GRAVE WAS READY NO NOBURY IT WITH HIM ITS ALL I CAN GIVE YOU NOW POOR TOM AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT THEY LAID HIM IN AND THE MEN SHOVELLED

WED SERVE HIM SO FAITHFUL SAID THE OTHER HARD TIMES HERE MASR SAID THE FIRST DO MASR BUY US PLEASE I CANTI CANT SAID GEORGE WITH DIFFICULTY MOTIONING THEM OFF ITS IMPOSSIBLE THE POOR FELLOWS LOOKED DEJECTED AND WALKED OFF IN SILENCE WITNESS ETERNAL GOD SAID GEORGE KNEELING ON THE GRAVE OF HIS POOR FRIEND OH WITNESS THAT FROM THIS HOUR I WILL DO WHAT ONE MAN CAN TO DRIVE OUT THIS CURSE OF SLAVERY FROM MY LAND THERE IS NO MONUMENT TO MARK THE LAST RESTINGPLACE OF OUR FRIEND HE NEEDS NONE HIS LORD KNOWS WHERE HE LIES AND WILL RAISE HIM UP IMMORTAL TO APPEAR WITH HIM WHEN HE SHALL APPEAR IN HIS GLORY PITY HIM NOT SUCH A LIFE AND DEATH IS NOT FOR PITY NOT IN THE RICHES OF OMNIPOTENCE IS THE CHIEF GLORY OF GOD BUT IN SELFDENYING SUFFERING LOVE AND BLESSED ARE THE MEN WHOM HE CALLS TO FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM BEARING THEIR CROSS AFTER HIM WITH PATIENCE OF SUCH IT IS WRITTEN BLESSED ARE THEY THAT MOURN FOR THEY SHALL BE COMFORTED CHAPTER XLII AN AUTHENTIC GHOST STORY FOR SOME REMARKABLE REASON GHOSTLY LEGENDS WERE UNCOMMONLY RIFE ABOUT THIS TIME AMONG THE SERVANTS ON LEGREES PLACE IT WAS WHISPERINGLY ASSERTED THAT FOOTSTEPS IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT HAD BEEN HEARD DESCENDING THE GARRET STAIRS AND PATROLLING THE HOUSE IN VAIN THE DOORS OF THE UPPER ENTRY HAD BEEN LOCKED THE GHOST EITHER CARRIED A DUPLICATE KEY IN ITS POCKET OR AVAILED ITSELF OF A GHOSTS IMMEMORIAL PRIVILEGE OF COMING THROUGH THE KEYHOLE AND PROMENADED AS BEFORE WITH A FREEDOM THAT WAS ALARMING AUTHORITIES WERE SOMEWHAT DIVIDED AS TO THE OUTWARD FORM OF THE SPIRIT OWING TO A CUSTOM QUITE PREVALENT AMONG NEGROESAND FOR AUGHT WE KNOW AMONG WHITES TOOOF INVARIABLY SHUTTING THE EYES AND COVERING UP HEADS UNDER BLANKETS PETTICOATS OR WHATEVER ELSE MIGHT COME IN USE FOR A SHELTER ON THESE OCCASIONS OF COURSE AS EVERYBODY KNOWS WHEN THE BODILY EYES ARE THUS OUT OF THE LISTS THE SPIRITUAL EYES ARE UNCOMMONLY VIVACIOUS AND PERSPICUOUS AND THEREFORE THERE WERE ABUNDANCE OF FULLLENGTH PORTRAITS OF THE GHOST ABUNDANTLY SWORN AND TESTIFIED TO WHICH AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WITH PORTRAITS AGREED WITH EACH OTHER IN NO PARTICULAR EXCEPT THE COMMON FAMILY PECULIARITY OF THE GHOST TRIBETHE WEARING OF A WHITE SHEET THE POOR SOULS WERE NOT VERSED IN ANCIENT HISTORY AND DID NOT KNOW THAT SHAKSPEARE HAD AUTHENTICATED THIS COSTUME BY TELLING HOW THE SHEETED DEAD DID SQUEAK AND GIBBER IN THE STREETS OF ROME HAMLET ACT I SCENE LINES AND THEREFORE THEIR ALL HITTING UPON THIS IS A STRIKING FACT IN PNEUMATOLOGY WHICH WE RECOMMEND TO THE ATTENTION OF SPIRITUAL MEDIA GENERALLY BE IT AS IT MAY WE HAVE PRIVATE REASONS FOR KNOWING THAT A TALL FIGURE IN A WHITE SHEET DID WALK AT THE MOST APPROVED GHOSTLY HOURS AROUND THE LEGREE PREMISESPASS OUT THE DOORS GLIDE ABOUT THE HOUSEDISAPPEAR AT INTERVALS AND REAPPEARING PASS UP THE SILENT STAIRWAY INTO THAT FATAL GARRET AND THAT IN THE MORNING THE ENTRY DOORS WERE ALL FOUND SHUT AND LOCKED AS FIRM AS EVER LEGREE COULD NOT HELP OVERHEARING THIS WHISPERING AND IT WAS ALL THE MORE EXCITING TO HIM FROM THE PAINS THAT WERE TAKEN TO CONCEAL IT FROM HIM HE DRANK MORE BRANDY THAN USUAL HELD UP HIS HEAD BRISKLY AND SWORE LOUDER THAN EVER IN THE DAYTIME BUT HE HAD BAD DREAMS AND THE VISIONS OF HIS HEAD ON HIS BED WERE ANYTHING BUT AGREEABLE THE NIGHT AFTER TOMS BODY HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY HE RODE TO THE NEXT TOWN FOR A CAROUSE AND HAD A HIGH ONE GOT HOME LATE AND TIRED LOCKED HIS DOOR TOOK OUT THE KEY AND WENT TO BED AFTER ALL LET A MAN TAKE WHAT PAINS HE MAY TO HUSH IT DOWN A HUMAN SOUL IS AN AWFUL GHOSTLY UNQUIET POSSESSION FOR A BAD MAN TO HAVE WHO KNOWS THE METES AND BOUNDS OF IT WHO KNOWS ALL ITS AWFUL PERHAPSESTHOSE SHUDDERINGS AND TREMBLINGS WHICH IT CAN NO MORE LIVE DOWN THAN IT CAN OUTLIVE ITS OWN ETERNITY WHAT A FOOL IS HE WHO LOCKS HIS DOOR TO KEEP OUT SPIRITS WHO HAS IN HIS OWN BOSOM A SPIRIT HE DARES NOT MEET ALONEWHOSE VOICE SMOTHERED FAR DOWN AND PILED OVER WITH MOUNTAINS OF EARTHLINESS IS YET LIKE THE FOREWARNING TRUMPET OF DOOM BUT LEGREE LOCKED HIS DOOR AND SET A CHAIR AGAINST IT HE SET A NIGHTLAMP AT THE HEAD OF HIS BED AND PUT HIS PISTOLS THERE HE EXAMINED THE CATCHES AND FASTENINGS OF THE WINDOWS AND THEN SWORE HE DIDNT CARE FOR THE DEVIL AND ALL HIS ANGELS AND WENT TO SLEEP WELL HE SLEPT FOR HE WAS TIREDSLEPT SOUNDLY BUT FINALLY THERE CAME OVER HIS SLEEP A SHADOW A HORROR AN APPREHENSION OF SOMETHING DREADFUL HANGING OVER HIM IT WAS HIS MOTHERS SHROUD HE THOUGHT BUT CASSY HAD IT HOLDING IT UP AND SHOWING IT TO HIM HE HEARD A CONFUSED NOISE OF SCREAMS AND GROANINGS AND WITH IT ALL HE KNEW HE WAS ASLEEP AND HE STRUGGLED TO WAKE HIMSELF HE WAS HALF AWAKE HE WAS SURE SOMETHING WAS COMING INTO HIS ROOM HE KNEW THE DOOR WAS OPENING BUT HE COULD NOT STIR HAND OR FOOT AT LAST HE TURNED WITH A START THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND HE SAW A HAND PUTTING OUT HIS LIGHT IT WAS A CLOUDY MISTY MOONLIGHT AND THERE HE SAW ITSOMETHING WHITE GLIDING IN HE HEARD THE STILL RUSTLE OF ITS GHOSTLY GARMENTS IT STOOD STILL BY HIS BEDA COLD HAND TOUCHED HIS A VOICE SAID THREE TIMES IN A LOW FEARFUL WHISPER COME COME COME AND WHILE HE LAY SWEATING WITH TERROR HE KNEW NOT WHEN OR HOW THE THING WAS GONE HE SPRANG OUT OF BED AND PULLED AT THE DOOR IT WAS SHUT AND LOCKED AND THE MAN FELL DOWN IN A SWOON AFTER THIS LEGREE BECAME A HARDER DRINKER THAN EVER BEFORE HE NO LONGER DRANK CAUTIOUSLY PRUDENTLY BUT IMPRUDENTLY AND RECKLESSLY THERE WERE REPORTS AROUND THE COUNTRY SOON AFTER THAT HE WAS SICK AND DYING EXCESS HAD BROUGHT ON THAT FRIGHTFUL DISEASE THAT SEEMS TO THROW THE LURID SHADOWS OF A COMING RETRIBUTION BACK INTO THE PRESENT LIFE NONE COULD BEAR THE HORRORS OF THAT SICK ROOM WHEN HE RAVED AND SCREAMED AND SPOKE OF SIGHTS WHICH ALMOST STOPPED THE BLOOD OF THOSE WHO HEARD HIM AND AT HIS DYING BED STOOD A STERN WHITE INEXORABLE FIGURE SAYING COME COME COME BY A SINGULAR COINCIDENCE ON THE VERY NIGHT THAT THIS VISION APPEARED TO LEGREE THE HOUSEDOOR WAS FOUND OPEN IN THE MORNING AND SOME OF THE NEGROES HAD SEEN TWO WHITE FIGURES GLIDING DOWN THE AVENUE TOWARDS THE HIGHROAD IT WAS NEAR SUNRISE WHEN CASSY AND EMMELINE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT IN A LITTLE KNOT OF TREES NEAR THE TOWN CASSY WAS DRESSED AFTER THE MANNER OF THE CREOLE SPANISH LADIESWHOLLY IN BLACK A SMALL BLACK BONNET ON HER HEAD COVERED BY A VEIL THICK WITH EMBROIDERY CONCEALED HER FACE IT HAD BEEN AGREED THAT IN THEIR ESCAPE SHE WAS TO PERSONATE THE CHARACTER OF A CREOLE LADY AND EMMELINE THAT OF HER SERVANT BROUGHT UP FROM EARLY LIFE IN CONNECTION WITH THE HIGHEST SOCIETY THE LANGUAGE MOVEMENTS AND AIR OF CASSY WERE ALL IN AGREEMENT WITH THIS IDEA AND SHE HAD STILL ENOUGH REMAINING WITH HER OF A ONCE SPLENDID WARDROBE AND SETS OF JEWELS TO ENABLE HER TO PERSONATE THE THING TO ADVANTAGE SHE STOPPED IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN WHERE SHE HAD NOTICED TRUNKS FOR SALE AND PURCHASED A HANDSOME ONE THIS SHE REQUESTED THE MAN TO SEND ALONG WITH HER AND ACCORDINGLY THUS ESCORTED BY A BOY WHEELING HER TRUNK AND EMMELINE BEHIND HER CARRYING HER CARPETBAG AND SUNDRY BUNDLES SHE MADE HER APPEARANCE AT THE SMALL TAVERN LIKE A LADY OF CONSIDERATION THE FIRST PERSON THAT STRUCK HER AFTER HER ARRIVAL WAS GEORGE SHELBY WHO WAS STAYING THERE AWAITING THE NEXT BOAT CASSY HAD REMARKED THE YOUNG MAN FROM HER LOOPHOLE IN THE GARRET AND SEEN HIM BEAR AWAY THE BODY OF TOM AND OBSERVED WITH SECRET EXULTATION HIS RENCONTRE WITH LEGREE SUBSEQUENTLY SHE HAD GATHERED FROM THE CONVERSATIONS SHE HAD OVERHEARD AMONG THE NEGROES AS SHE GLIDED ABOUT IN HER GHOSTLY DISGUISE AFTER NIGHTFALL WHO HE WAS AND IN WHAT RELATION HE STOOD TO TOM SHE THEREFORE FELT AN IMMEDIATE ACCESSION OF CONFIDENCE WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HE WAS LIKE HERSELF AWAITING THE NEXT BOAT CASSYS AIR AND MANNER ADDRESS AND EVIDENT COMMAND OF MONEY PREVENTED ANY RISING DISPOSITION TO SUSPICION IN THE HOTEL PEOPLE NEVER INQUIRE TOO CLOSELY INTO THOSE WHO ARE FAIR ON THE MAIN POINT OF PAYING WELLA THING WHICH CASSY HAD FORESEEN WHEN SHE PROVIDED HERSELF WITH MONEY IN THE EDGE OF THE EVENING A BOAT WAS HEARD COMING ALONG AND GEORGE SHELBY HANDED CASSY ABOARD WITH THE POLITENESS WHICH COMES NATURALLY TO EVERY KENTUCKIAN AND EXERTED HIMSELF TO PROVIDE HER WITH A GOOD STATEROOM CASSY KEPT HER ROOM AND BED ON PRETEXT OF ILLNESS DURING THE WHOLE TIME THEY WERE ON RED RIVER AND WAS WAITED ON WITH OBSEQUIOUS DEVOTION BY HER ATTENDANT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER GEORGE HAVING LEARNED THAT THE COURSE OF THE STRANGE LADY WAS UPWARD LIKE HIS OWN PROPOSED TO TAKE A STATEROOM FOR HER ON THE SAME BOAT WITH HIMSELFGOODNATUREDLY COMPASSIONATING HER FEEBLE HEALTH AND DESIROUS TO DO WHAT HE COULD TO ASSIST HER BEHOLD THEREFORE THE WHOLE PARTY SAFELY TRANSFERRED TO THE GOOD STEAMER CINCINNATI AND SWEEPING UP THE RIVER UNDER A POWERFUL HEAD OF STEAM CASSYS HEALTH WAS MUCH BETTER SHE SAT UPON THE GUARDS CAME TO THE TABLE AND WAS REMARKED UPON IN THE BOAT AS A LADY THAT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY HANDSOME FROM THE MOMENT THAT GEORGE GOT THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF HER FACE HE WAS TROUBLED WITH ONE OF THOSE FLEETING AND INDEFINITE LIKENESSES WHICH ALMOST EVERY BODY CAN REMEMBER AND HAS BEEN AT TIMES PERPLEXED WITH HE COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF FROM LOOKING AT HER AND WATCHING HER PERPETUALLY AT TABLE OR SITTING AT HER STATEROOM DOOR STILL SHE WOULD ENCOUNTER THE YOUNG MANS EYES FIXED ON HER AND POLITELY WITHDRAWN WHEN SHE SHOWED BY HER COUNTENANCE THAT SHE WAS SENSIBLE TO THE OBSERVATION CASSY BECAME UNEASY SHE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE SUSPECTED SOMETHING AND FINALLY RESOLVED TO THROW HERSELF ENTIRELY ON HIS GENEROSITY AND INTRUSTED HIM WITH HER WHOLE HISTORY GEORGE WAS HEARTILY DISPOSED TO SYMPATHIZE WITH ANY ONE WHO HAD ESCAPED FROM LEGREES PLANTATIONA PLACE THAT HE COULD NOT REMEMBER OR SPEAK OF WITH PATIENCEAND WITH THE COURAGEOUS DISREGARD OF CONSEQUENCES WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS AGE AND STATE HE ASSURED HER THAT HE WOULD DO ALL IN HIS POWER TO PROTECT AND BRING THEM THROUGH THE NEXT STATEROOM TO CASSYS WAS OCCUPIED BY A FRENCH LADY NAMED DE THOUX WHO WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A FINE LITTLE DAUGHTER A CHILD OF SOME TWELVE SUMMERS THIS LADY HAVING GATHERED FROM GEORGES CONVERSATION THAT HE WAS FROM KENTUCKY SEEMED EVIDENTLY DISPOSED TO CULTIVATE HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN WHICH DESIGN SHE WAS SECONDED BY THE GRACES OF HER LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS ABOUT AS PRETTY A PLAYTHING AS EVER DIVERTED THE WEARINESS OF A FORTNIGHTS TRIP ON A STEAMBOAT GEORGES CHAIR WAS OFTEN PLACED AT HER STATEROOM DOOR AND CASSY AS SHE SAT UPON THE GUARDS COULD HEAR THEIR CONVERSATION MADAME DE THOUX WAS VERY MINUTE IN HER INQUIRIES AS TO KENTUCKY WHERE SHE SAID SHE HAD RESIDED IN A FORMER PERIOD OF HER LIFE GEORGE DISCOVERED TO HIS SURPRISE THAT HER FORMER RESIDENCE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HIS OWN VICINITY AND HER INQUIRIES SHOWED A KNOWLEDGE OF PEOPLE AND THINGS IN HIS VICINITY THAT WAS PERFECTLY SURPRISING TO HIM DO YOU KNOW SAID MADAME DE THOUX TO HIM ONE DAY OF ANY MAN IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE NAME OF HARRIS THERE IS AN OLD FELLOW OF THAT NAME LIVES NOT FAR FROM MY FATHERS PLACE SAID GEORGE WE NEVER HAVE HAD MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH HIM THOUGH HE IS A LARGE SLAVEOWNER I BELIEVE SAID MADAME DE THOUX WITH A MANNER WHICH SEEMED TO BETRAY MORE INTEREST THAN SHE WAS EXACTLY WILLING TO SHOW HE IS SAID GEORGE LOOKING RATHER SURPRISED AT HER MANNER DID YOU EVER KNOW OF HIS HAVINGPERHAPS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIS HAVING A MULATTO BOY NAMED GEORGE O CERTAINLYGEORGE HARRISI KNOW HIM WELL HE MARRIED A SERVANT OF MY MOTHERS BUT HAS ESCAPED NOW TO CANADA HE HAS SAID MADAME DE THOUX QUICKLY THANK GOD GEORGE LOOKED A SURPRISED INQUIRY BUT SAID NOTHING MADAME DE THOUX LEANED HER HEAD ON HER HAND AND BURST INTO TEARS HE IS MY BROTHER SHE SAID MADAME SAID GEORGE WITH A STRONG ACCENT OF SURPRISE YES SAID MADAME DE THOUX LIFTING HER HEAD PROUDLY AND WIPING HER TEARS MR SHELBY GEORGE HARRIS IS MY BROTHER I AM PERFECTLY ASTONISHED SAID GEORGE PUSHING BACK HIS CHAIR A PACE OR TWO AND LOOKING AT MADAME DE THOUX I WAS SOLD TO THE SOUTH WHEN HE WAS A BOY SAID SHE I WAS BOUGHT BY A GOOD AND GENEROUS MAN HE TOOK ME WITH HIM TO THE WEST INDIES SET ME FREE AND MARRIED ME IT IS BUT LATELY THAT HE DIED AND I WAS GOING UP TO KENTUCKY TO SEE IF I COULD FIND AND REDEEM MY BROTHER I HEARD HIM SPEAK OF A SISTER EMILY THAT WAS SOLD SOUTH SAID GEORGE YES INDEED I AM THE ONE SAID MADAME DE THOUXTELL ME WHAT SORT OF A A VERY FINE YOUNG MAN SAID GEORGE NOTWITHSTANDING THE CURSE OF SLAVERY THAT LAY ON HIM HE SUSTAINED A FIRST RATE CHARACTER BOTH FOR INTELLIGENCE AND PRINCIPLE I KNOW YOU SEE HE SAID BECAUSE HE MARRIED IN OUR FAMILY WHAT SORT OF A GIRL SAID MADAME DE THOUX EAGERLY A TREASURE SAID GEORGE A BEAUTIFUL INTELLIGENT AMIABLE GIRL VERY PIOUS MY MOTHER HAD BROUGHT HER UP AND TRAINED HER AS CAREFULLY ALMOST AS A DAUGHTER SHE COULD READ AND WRITE EMBROIDER AND SEW BEAUTIFULLY AND WAS A BEAUTIFUL SINGER WAS SHE BORN IN YOUR HOUSE SAID MADAME DE THOUX NO FATHER BOUGHT HER ONCE IN ONE OF HIS TRIPS TO NEW ORLEANS AND BROUGHT HER UP AS A PRESENT TO MOTHER SHE WAS ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE YEARS OLD THEN FATHER WOULD NEVER TELL MOTHER WHAT HE GAVE FOR HER BUT THE OTHER DAY IN LOOKING OVER HIS OLD PAPERS WE CAME ACROSS THE BILL OF SALE HE PAID AN EXTRAVAGANT SUM FOR HER TO BE SURE I SUPPOSE ON ACCOUNT OF HER EXTRAORDINARY BEAUTY GEORGE SAT WITH HIS BACK TO CASSY AND DID NOT SEE THE ABSORBED EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE AS HE WAS GIVING THESE DETAILS AT THIS POINT IN THE STORY SHE TOUCHED HIS ARM AND WITH A FACE PERFECTLY WHITE WITH INTEREST SAID DO YOU KNOW THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE HE BOUGHT HER OF A MAN OF THE NAME OF SIMMONS I THINK WAS THE PRINCIPAL IN THE TRANSACTION AT LEAST I THINK THAT WAS THE NAME ON THE BILL OF SALE O MY GOD SAID CASSY AND FELL INSENSIBLE ON THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN GEORGE WAS WIDE AWAKE NOW AND SO WAS MADAME DE THOUX THOUGH NEITHER OF THEM COULD CONJECTURE WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF CASSYS FAINTING STILL THEY MADE ALL THE TUMULT WHICH IS PROPER IN SUCH CASESGEORGE UPSETTING A WASHPITCHER AND BREAKING TWO TUMBLERS IN THE WARMTH OF HIS HUMANITY AND VARIOUS LADIES IN THE CABIN HEARING THAT SOMEBODY HAD FAINTED CROWDED THE STATEROOM DOOR AND KEPT OUT ALL THE AIR THEY POSSIBLY COULD SO THAT ON THE WHOLE EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT COULD BE EXPECTED POOR CASSY WHEN SHE RECOVERED TURNED HER FACE TO THE WALL AND WEPT AND SOBBED LIKE A CHILDPERHAPS MOTHER YOU CAN TELL WHAT SHE WAS THINKING OF PERHAPS YOU CANNOTBUT SHE FELT AS SURE IN THAT HOUR THAT GOD HAD HAD MERCY ON HER AND THAT SHE SHOULD SEE HER DAUGHTERAS SHE DID MONTHS AFTERWARDSWHENBUT WE ANTICIPATE CHAPTER XLIII RESULTS THE REST OF OUR STORY IS SOON TOLD GEORGE SHELBY INTERESTED AS ANY OTHER YOUNG MAN MIGHT BE BY THE ROMANCE OF THE INCIDENT NO LESS THAN BY FEELINGS OF HUMANITY WAS AT THE PAINS TO SEND TO CASSY THE BILL OF SALE OF ELIZA WHOSE DATE AND NAME ALL CORRESPONDED WITH HER OWN KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS AND FELT NO DOUBT UPON HER MIND AS TO THE IDENTITY OF HER CHILD IT REMAINED NOW ONLY FOR HER TO TRACE OUT THE PATH OF THE FUGITIVES MADAME DE THOUX AND SHE THUS DRAWN TOGETHER BY THE SINGULAR COINCIDENCE OF THEIR FORTUNES PROCEEDED IMMEDIATELY TO CANADA AND BEGAN A TOUR OF INQUIRY AMONG THE STATIONS WHERE THE NUMEROUS FUGITIVES FROM SLAVERY ARE LOCATED AT AMHERSTBERG THEY FOUND THE MISSIONARY WITH WHOM GEORGE AND ELIZA HAD TAKEN SHELTER ON THEIR FIRST ARRIVAL IN CANADA AND THROUGH HIM WERE ENABLED TO TRACE THE FAMILY TO MONTREAL GEORGE AND ELIZA HAD NOW BEEN FIVE YEARS FREE GEORGE HAD FOUND CONSTANT OCCUPATION IN THE SHOP OF A WORTHY MACHINIST WHERE HE HAD BEEN EARNING A COMPETENT SUPPORT FOR HIS FAMILY WHICH IN THE MEAN TIME HAD BEEN INCREASED BY THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER DAUGHTER LITTLE HARRYA FINE BRIGHT BOYHAD BEEN PUT TO A GOOD SCHOOL AND WAS MAKING RAPID PROFICIENCY IN KNOWLEDGE THE WORTHY PASTOR OF THE STATION IN AMHERSTBERG WHERE GEORGE HAD FIRST LANDED WAS SO MUCH INTERESTED IN THE STATEMENTS OF MADAME DE THOUX AND CASSY THAT HE YIELDED TO THE SOLICITATIONS OF THE FORMER TO ACCOMPANY THEM TO MONTREAL IN THEIR SEARCHSHE BEARING ALL THE EXPENSE OF THE EXPEDITION THE SCENE NOW CHANGES TO A SMALL NEAT TENEMENT IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONTREAL THE TIME EVENING A CHEERFUL FIRE BLAZES ON THE HEARTH A TEATABLE COVERED WITH A SNOWY CLOTH STANDS PREPARED FOR THE EVENING MEAL IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM WAS A TABLE COVERED WITH A GREEN CLOTH WHERE WAS AN OPEN WRITINGDESK PENS PAPER AND OVER IT A SHELF OF WELLSELECTED BOOKS THIS WAS GEORGES STUDY THE SAME ZEAL FOR SELFIMPROVEMENT WHICH LED HIM TO STEAL THE MUCH COVETED ARTS OF READING AND WRITING AMID ALL THE TOIL AND DISCOURAGEMENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE STILL LED HIM TO DEVOTE ALL HIS LEISURE TIME TO SELFCULTIVATION AT THIS PRESENT TIME HE IS SEATED AT THE TABLE MAKING NOTES FROM A VOLUME OF THE FAMILY LIBRARY HE HAS BEEN READING COME GEORGE SAYS ELIZA YOUVE BEEN GONE ALL DAY DO PUT DOWN THAT BOOK AND LETS TALK WHILE IM GETTING TEADO AND LITTLE ELIZA SECONDS THE EFFORT BY TODDLING UP TO HER FATHER AND TRYING TO PULL THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND INSTALL HERSELF ON HIS KNEE AS A SUBSTITUTE O YOU LITTLE WITCH SAYS GEORGE YIELDING AS IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MAN ALWAYS MUST THATS RIGHT SAYS ELIZA AS SHE BEGINS TO CUT A LOAF OF BREAD A LITTLE OLDER SHE LOOKS HER FORM A LITTLE FULLER HER AIR MORE MATRONLY THAN OF YORE BUT EVIDENTLY CONTENTED AND HAPPY AS WOMAN NEED BE HARRY MY BOY HOW DID YOU COME ON IN THAT SUM TODAY SAYS GEORGE AS HE LAID HIS HAND ON HIS SONS HEAD HARRY HAS LOST HIS LONG CURLS BUT HE CAN NEVER LOSE THOSE EYES AND EYELASHES AND THAT FINE BOLD BROW THAT FLUSHES WITH TRIUMPH AS HE ANSWERS I DID IT EVERY BIT OF IT MYSELF FATHER AND NOBODY HELPED ME THATS RIGHT SAYS HIS FATHER DEPEND ON YOURSELF MY SON YOU HAVE A BETTER CHANCE THAN EVER YOUR POOR FATHER HAD AT THIS MOMENT THERE IS A RAP AT THE DOOR AND ELIZA GOES AND OPENS IT THE DELIGHTEDWHY THIS YOUCALLS UP HER HUSBAND AND THE GOOD PASTOR OF AMHERSTBERG IS WELCOMED THERE ARE TWO MORE WOMEN WITH HIM AND ELIZA ASKS THEM TO SIT DOWN NOW IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD THE HONEST PASTOR HAD ARRANGED A LITTLE PROGRAMME ACCORDING TO WHICH THIS AFFAIR WAS TO DEVELOP ITSELF AND ON THE WAY UP ALL HAD VERY CAUTIOUSLY AND PRUDENTLY EXHORTED EACH OTHER NOT TO LET THINGS OUT EXCEPT ACCORDING TO PREVIOUS ARRANGEMENT WHAT WAS THE GOOD MANS CONSTERNATION THEREFORE JUST AS HE HAD MOTIONED TO THE LADIES TO BE SEATED AND WAS TAKING OUT HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF TO WIPE HIS MOUTH SO AS TO PROCEED TO HIS INTRODUCTORY SPEECH IN GOOD ORDER WHEN MADAME DE THOUX UPSET THE WHOLE PLAN BY THROWING HER ARMS AROUND GEORGES NECK AND LETTING ALL OUT AT ONCE BY SAYING O GEORGE DONT YOU KNOW ME IM YOUR SISTER EMILY CASSY HAD SEATED HERSELF MORE COMPOSEDLY AND WOULD HAVE CARRIED ON HER PART VERY WELL HAD NOT LITTLE ELIZA SUDDENLY APPEARED BEFORE HER IN EXACT SHAPE AND FORM EVERY OUTLINE AND CURL JUST AS HER DAUGHTER WAS WHEN SHE SAW HER LAST THE LITTLE THING PEERED UP IN HER FACE AND CASSY CAUGHT HER UP IN HER ARMS PRESSED HER TO HER BOSOM SAYING WHAT AT THE MOMENT SHE REALLY BELIEVED DARLING IM YOUR MOTHER IN FACT IT WAS A TROUBLESOME MATTER TO DO UP EXACTLY IN PROPER ORDER BUT THE GOOD PASTOR AT LAST SUCCEEDED IN GETTING EVERYBODY QUIET AND DELIVERING THE SPEECH WITH WHICH HE HAD INTENDED TO OPEN THE EXERCISES AND IN WHICH AT LAST HE SUCCEEDED SO WELL THAT HIS WHOLE AUDIENCE WERE SOBBING ABOUT HIM IN A MANNER THAT OUGHT TO SATISFY ANY ORATOR ANCIENT OR MODERN THEY KNELT TOGETHER AND THE GOOD MAN PRAYEDFOR THERE ARE SOME FEELINGS SO AGITATED AND TUMULTUOUS THAT THEY CAN FIND REST ONLY BY BEING POURED INTO THE BOSOM OF ALMIGHTY LOVEAND THEN RISING UP THE NEWFOUND FAMILY EMBRACED EACH OTHER WITH A HOLY TRUST IN HIM WHO FROM SUCH PERIL AND DANGERS AND BY SUCH UNKNOWN WAYS HAD BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER THE NOTEBOOK OF A MISSIONARY AMONG THE CANADIAN FUGITIVES CONTAINS TRUTH STRANGER THAN FICTION HOW CAN IT BE OTHERWISE WHEN A SYSTEM PREVAILS WHICH WHIRLS FAMILIES AND SCATTERS THEIR MEMBERS AS THE WIND WHIRLS AND SCATTERS THE LEAVES OF AUTUMN THESE SHORES OF REFUGE LIKE THE ETERNAL SHORE OFTEN UNITE AGAIN IN GLAD COMMUNION HEARTS THAT FOR LONG YEARS HAVE MOURNED EACH OTHER AS LOST AND AFFECTING BEYOND EXPRESSION IS THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH EVERY NEW ARRIVAL AMONG THEM IS MET IF PERCHANCE IT MAY BRING TIDINGS OF MOTHER SISTER CHILD OR WIFE STILL LOST TO VIEW IN THE SHADOWS OF SLAVERY DEEDS OF HEROISM ARE WROUGHT HERE MORE THAN THOSE OF ROMANCE WHEN DEFYING TORTURE AND BRAVING DEATH ITSELF THE FUGITIVE VOLUNTARILY THREADS HIS WAY BACK TO THE TERRORS AND PERILS OF THAT DARK LAND THAT HE MAY BRING OUT HIS SISTER OR MOTHER OR WIFE ONE YOUNG MAN OF WHOM A MISSIONARY HAS TOLD US TWICE RECAPTURED AND SUFFERING SHAMEFUL STRIPES FOR HIS HEROISM HAD ESCAPED AGAIN AND IN A LETTER WHICH WE HEARD READ TELLS HIS FRIENDS THAT HE IS GOING BACK A THIRD TIME THAT HE MAY AT LAST BRING AWAY HIS SISTER MY GOOD SIR IS THIS MAN A HERO OR A CRIMINAL WOULD NOT YOU DO AS MUCH FOR YOUR SISTER AND CAN YOU BLAME HIM BUT TO RETURN TO OUR FRIENDS WHOM WE LEFT WIPING THEIR EYES AND RECOVERING THEMSELVES FROM TOO GREAT AND SUDDEN A JOY THEY ARE NOW SEATED AROUND THE SOCIAL BOARD AND ARE GETTING DECIDEDLY COMPANIONABLE ONLY THAT CASSY WHO KEEPS LITTLE ELIZA ON HER LAP OCCASIONALLY SQUEEZES THE LITTLE THING IN A MANNER THAT RATHER ASTONISHES HER AND OBSTINATELY REFUSES TO HAVE HER MOUTH STUFFED WITH CAKE TO THE EXTENT THE LITTLE ONE DESIRESALLEGING WHAT THE CHILD RATHER WONDERS AT THAT SHE HAS GOT SOMETHING BETTER THAN CAKE AND DOESNT WANT IT AND INDEED IN TWO OR THREE DAYS SUCH A CHANGE HAS PASSED OVER CASSY THAT OUR READERS WOULD SCARCELY KNOW HER THE DESPAIRING HAGGARD EXPRESSION OF HER FACE HAD GIVEN WAY TO ONE OF GENTLE TRUST SHE SEEMED TO SINK AT ONCE INTO THE BOSOM OF THE FAMILY AND TAKE THE LITTLE ONES INTO HER HEART AS SOMETHING FOR WHICH IT LONG HAD WAITED INDEED HER LOVE SEEMED TO FLOW MORE NATURALLY TO THE LITTLE ELIZA THAN TO HER OWN DAUGHTER FOR SHE WAS THE EXACT IMAGE AND BODY OF THE CHILD WHOM SHE HAD LOST THE LITTLE ONE WAS A FLOWERY BOND BETWEEN MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THROUGH WHOM GREW UP ACQUAINTANCESHIP AND AFFECTION ELIZAS STEADY CONSISTENT PIETY REGULATED BY THE CONSTANT READING OF THE SACRED WORD MADE HER A PROPER GUIDE FOR THE SHATTERED AND WEARIED MIND OF HER MOTHER CASSY YIELDED AT ONCE AND WITH HER WHOLE SOUL TO EVERY GOOD INFLUENCE AND BECAME A DEVOUT AND TENDER CHRISTIAN AFTER A DAY OR TWO MADAME DE THOUX TOLD HER BROTHER MORE PARTICULARLY OF HER AFFAIRS THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND HAD LEFT HER AN AMPLE FORTUNE WHICH SHE GENEROUSLY OFFERED TO SHARE WITH THE FAMILY WHEN SHE ASKED GEORGE WHAT WAY SHE COULD BEST APPLY IT FOR HIM HE ANSWERED GIVE ME AN EDUCATION EMILY THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY HEARTS DESIRE THEN I CAN DO ALL THE REST ON MATURE DELIBERATION IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE WHOLE FAMILY SHOULD GO FOR SOME YEARS TO FRANCE WHITHER THEY SAILED CARRYING EMMELINE WITH THEM THE GOOD LOOKS OF THE LATTER WON THE AFFECTION OF THE FIRST MATE OF THE VESSEL AND SHORTLY AFTER ENTERING THE PORT SHE BECAME HIS WIFE GEORGE REMAINED FOUR YEARS AT A FRENCH UNIVERSITY AND APPLYING HIMSELF WITH AN UNINTERMITTED ZEAL OBTAINED A VERY THOROUGH EDUCATION POLITICAL TROUBLES IN FRANCE AT LAST LED THE FAMILY AGAIN TO SEEK AN ASYLUM IN THIS COUNTRY GEORGES FEELINGS AND VIEWS AS AN EDUCATED MAN MAY BE BEST EXPRESSED IN A LETTER TO ONE OF HIS FRIENDS I FEEL SOMEWHAT AT A LOSS AS TO MY FUTURE COURSE TRUE AS YOU HAVE SAID TO ME I MIGHT MINGLE IN THE CIRCLES OF THE WHITES IN THIS COUNTRY MY SHADE OF COLOR IS SO SLIGHT AND THAT OF MY WIFE AND FAMILY SCARCE PERCEPTIBLE WELL PERHAPS ON SUFFERANCE I MIGHT BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I HAVE NO WISH TO MY SYMPATHIES ARE NOT FOR MY FATHERS RACE BUT FOR MY MOTHERS TO HIM I WAS NO MORE THAN A FINE DOG OR HORSE TO MY POOR HEARTBROKEN MOTHER I WAS A CHILD AND THOUGH I NEVER SAW HER AFTER THE CRUEL SALE THAT SEPARATED US TILL SHE DIED YET I KNOW SHE ALWAYS LOVED ME DEARLY I KNOW IT BY MY OWN HEART WHEN I THINK OF ALL SHE SUFFERED OF MY OWN EARLY SUFFERINGS OF THE DISTRESSES AND STRUGGLES OF MY HEROIC WIFE OF MY SISTER SOLD IN THE NEW ORLEANS SLAVEMARKETTHOUGH I HOPE TO HAVE NO UNCHRISTIAN SENTIMENTS YET I MAY BE EXCUSED FOR SAYING I HAVE NO WISH TO PASS FOR AN AMERICAN OR TO IDENTIFY MYSELF WITH THEM IT IS WITH THE OPPRESSED ENSLAVED AFRICAN RACE THAT I CAST IN MY LOT AND IF I WISHED ANYTHING I WOULD WISH MYSELF TWO SHADES DARKER RATHER THAN ONE LIGHTER THE DESIRE AND YEARNING OF MY SOUL IS FOR AN AFRICAN NATIONALITY I WANT A PEOPLE THAT SHALL HAVE A TANGIBLE SEPARATE EXISTENCE OF ITS OWN AND WHERE AM I TO LOOK FOR IT NOT IN HAYTI FOR IN HAYTI THEY HAD NOTHING TO START WITH A STREAM CANNOT RISE ABOVE ITS FOUNTAIN THE RACE THAT FORMED THE CHARACTER OF THE HAYTIENS WAS A WORNOUT EFFEMINATE ONE AND OF COURSE THE SUBJECT RACE WILL BE CENTURIES IN RISING TO ANYTHING WHERE THEN SHALL I LOOK ON THE SHORES OF AFRICA I SEE A REPUBLICA REPUBLIC FORMED OF PICKED MEN WHO BY ENERGY AND SELFEDUCATING FORCE HAVE IN MANY CASES INDIVIDUALLY RAISED THEMSELVES ABOVE A CONDITION OF SLAVERY HAVING GONE THROUGH A PREPARATORY STAGE OF FEEBLENESS THIS REPUBLIC HAS AT LAST BECOME AN ACKNOWLEDGED NATION ON THE FACE OF THE EARTHACKNOWLEDGED BY BOTH FRANCE AND ENGLAND THERE IT IS MY WISH TO GO AND FIND MYSELF A PEOPLE I AM AWARE NOW THAT I SHALL HAVE YOU ALL AGAINST ME BUT BEFORE YOU STRIKE HEAR ME DURING MY STAY IN FRANCE I HAVE FOLLOWED UP WITH INTENSE INTEREST THE HISTORY OF MY PEOPLE IN AMERICA I HAVE NOTED THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN ABOLITIONIST AND COLONIZATIONIST AND HAVE RECEIVED SOME IMPRESSIONS AS A DISTANT SPECTATOR WHICH COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ME AS A PARTICIPATOR I GRANT THAT THIS LIBERIA MAY HAVE SUBSERVED ALL SORTS OF PURPOSES BY BEING PLAYED OFF IN THE HANDS OF OUR OPPRESSORS AGAINST US DOUBTLESS THE SCHEME MAY HAVE BEEN USED IN UNJUSTIFIABLE WAYS AS A MEANS OF RETARDING OUR EMANCIPATION BUT THE QUESTION TO ME IS IS THERE NOT A GOD ABOVE ALL MANS SCHEMES MAY HE NOT HAVE OVERRULED THEIR DESIGNS AND FOUNDED FOR US A NATION BY THEM IN THESE DAYS A NATION IS BORN IN A DAY A NATION STARTS NOW WITH ALL THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF REPUBLICAN LIFE AND CIVILIZATION WROUGHT OUT TO ITS HANDIT HAS NOT TO DISCOVER BUT ONLY TO APPLY LET US THEN ALL TAKE HOLD TOGETHER WITH ALL OUR MIGHT AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THIS NEW ENTERPRISE AND THE WHOLE SPLENDID CONTINENT OF AFRICA OPENS BEFORE US AND OUR CHILDREN OUR NATION SHALL ROLL THE TIDE OF CIVILIZATION AND CHRISTIANITY ALONG ITS SHORES AND PLANT THERE MIGHTY REPUBLICS THAT GROWING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF TROPICAL VEGETATION SHALL BE FOR ALL COMING AGES DO YOU SAY THAT I AM DESERTING MY ENSLAVED BRETHREN I THINK NOT IF I FORGET THEM ONE HOUR ONE MOMENT OF MY LIFE SO MAY GOD FORGET ME BUT WHAT CAN I DO FOR THEM HERE CAN I BREAK THEIR CHAINS NO NOT AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT LET ME GO AND FORM PART OF A NATION WHICH SHALL HAVE A VOICE IN THE COUNCILS OF NATIONS AND THEN WE CAN SPEAK A NATION HAS A RIGHT TO ARGUE REMONSTRATE IMPLORE AND PRESENT THE CAUSE OF ITS RACEWHICH AN INDIVIDUAL HAS NOT IF EUROPE EVER BECOMES A GRAND COUNCIL OF FREE NATIONSAS I TRUST IN GOD IT WILLIF THERE SERFDOM AND ALL UNJUST AND OPPRESSIVE SOCIAL INEQUALITIES ARE DONE AWAY AND IF THEY AS FRANCE AND ENGLAND HAVE DONE ACKNOWLEDGE OUR POSITIONTHEN IN THE GREAT CONGRESS OF NATIONS WE WILL MAKE OUR APPEAL AND PRESENT THE CAUSE OF OUR ENSLAVED AND SUFFERING RACE AND IT CANNOT BE THAT FREE ENLIGHTENED AMERICA WILL NOT THEN DESIRE TO WIPE FROM HER ESCUTCHEON THAT BAR SINISTER WHICH DISGRACES HER AMONG NATIONS AND IS AS TRULY A CURSE TO HER AS TO THE ENSLAVED BUT YOU WILL TELL ME OUR RACE HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS TO MINGLE IN THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC AS THE IRISHMAN THE GERMAN THE SWEDE GRANTED THEY HAVE WE OUGHT TO BE FREE TO MEET AND MINGLETO RISE BY OUR INDIVIDUAL WORTH WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION OF CASTE OR COLOR AND THEY WHO DENY US THIS RIGHT ARE FALSE TO THEIR OWN PROFESSED PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN EQUALITY WE OUGHT IN PARTICULAR TO BE ALLOWED HERE WE HAVE MORE THAN THE RIGHTS OF COMMON MENWE HAVE THE CLAIM OF AN INJURED RACE FOR REPARATION BUT THEN I DO NOT WANT IT I WANT A COUNTRY A NATION OF MY OWN I THINK THAT THE AFRICAN RACE HAS PECULIARITIES YET TO BE UNFOLDED IN THE LIGHT OF CIVILIZATION AND CHRISTIANITY WHICH IF NOT THE SAME WITH THOSE OF THE ANGLOSAXON MAY PROVE TO BE MORALLY OF EVEN A HIGHER TYPE TO THE ANGLOSAXON RACE HAS BEEN INTRUSTED THE DESTINIES OF THE WORLD DURING ITS PIONEER PERIOD OF STRUGGLE AND CONFLICT TO THAT MISSION ITS STERN INFLEXIBLE ENERGETIC ELEMENTS WERE WELL ADAPTED BUT AS A CHRISTIAN I LOOK FOR ANOTHER ERA TO ARISE ON ITS BORDERS I TRUST WE STAND AND THE THROES THAT NOW CONVULSE THE NATIONS ARE TO MY HOPE BUT THE BIRTHPANGS OF AN HOUR OF UNIVERSAL PEACE AND BROTHERHOOD I TRUST THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFRICA IS TO BE ESSENTIALLY A CHRISTIAN ONE IF NOT A DOMINANT AND COMMANDING RACE THEY ARE AT LEAST AN AFFECTIONATE MAGNANIMOUS AND FORGIVING ONE HAVING BEEN CALLED IN THE FURNACE OF INJUSTICE AND OPPRESSION THEY HAVE NEED TO BIND CLOSER TO THEIR HEARTS THAT SUBLIME DOCTRINE OF LOVE AND FORGIVENESS THROUGH WHICH ALONE THEY ARE TO CONQUER WHICH IT IS TO BE THEIR MISSION TO SPREAD OVER THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA IN MYSELF I CONFESS I AM FEEBLE FOR THISFULL HALF THE BLOOD IN MY VEINS IS THE HOT AND HASTY SAXON BUT I HAVE AN ELOQUENT PREACHER OF THE GOSPEL EVER BY MY SIDE IN THE PERSON OF MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHEN I WANDER HER GENTLER SPIRIT EVER RESTORES ME AND KEEPS BEFORE MY EYES THE CHRISTIAN CALLING AND MISSION OF OUR RACE AS A CHRISTIAN PATRIOT AS A TEACHER OF CHRISTIANITY I GO TO MY COUNTRYMY CHOSEN MY GLORIOUS AFRICAAND TO HER IN MY HEART I SOMETIMES APPLY THOSE SPLENDID WORDS OF PROPHECY WHEREAS THOU HAST BEEN FORSAKEN AND HATED SO THAT NO MAN WENT THROUGH THEE I WILL MAKE THEE AN ETERNAL EXCELLENCE A JOY OF MANY GENERATIONS YOU WILL CALL ME AN ENTHUSIAST YOU WILL TELL ME THAT I HAVE NOT WELL CONSIDERED WHAT I AM UNDERTAKING BUT I HAVE CONSIDERED AND COUNTED THE COST I GO TO LIBERIA NOT AS AN ELYSIUM OF ROMANCE BUT AS TO A FIELD OF WORK I EXPECT TO WORK WITH BOTH HANDSTO WORK HARD TO WORK AGAINST ALL SORTS OF DIFFICULTIES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS AND TO WORK TILL I DIE THIS IS WHAT I GO FOR AND IN THIS I AM QUITE SURE I SHALL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK OF MY DETERMINATION DO NOT DIVORCE ME FROM YOUR CONFIDENCE AND THINK THAT IN WHATEVER I

INGENUITY WHICH WHEN A CHILD MADE HER SO MULTIFORM AND RESTLESS IN HER DEVELOPMENTS IS NOW EMPLOYED IN A SAFER AND WHOLESOMER MANNER IN TEACHING THE CHILDREN OF HER OWN COUNTRY PSIT WILL BE A

MEMORIAL TO PUT YOU ALL IN MIND TO FOLLOW IN HIS STEPS AND BE HONEST AND FAITHFUL AND CHRISTIAN AS HE WAS CHAPTER XLV CONCLUDING REMARKS THE WRITER HAS OFTEN BEEN INQUIRED OF BY CORRESPONDENTS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHETHER THIS NARRATIVE IS A TRUE ONE AND TO THESE INQUIRIES SHE WILL GIVE ONE GENERAL ANSWER THE SEPARATE INCIDENTS THAT COMPOSE THE NARRATIVE ARE TO A VERY GREAT EXTENT AUTHENTIC OCCURRING MANY OF THEM EITHER UNDER HER OWN OBSERVATION OR THAT OF HER PERSONAL FRIENDS SHE OR HER FRIENDS HAVE OBSERVED CHARACTERS THE COUNTERPART OF ALMOST ALL THAT ARE HERE INTRODUCED AND MANY OF THE SAYINGS ARE WORD FOR WORD AS HEARD HERSELF OR REPORTED TO HER THE PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF ELIZA THE CHARACTER ASCRIBED TO HER ARE SKETCHES DRAWN FROM LIFE THE INCORRUPTIBLE FIDELITY PIETY AND HONESTY OF UNCLE TOM HAD MORE THAN ONE DEVELOPMENT TO HER PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE SOME OF THE MOST DEEPLY TRAGIC AND ROMANTIC SOME OF THE MOST TERRIBLE INCIDENTS HAVE ALSO THEIR PARALLELS IN REALITY THE INCIDENT OF THE MOTHERS CROSSING THE OHIO RIVER ON THE ICE IS A WELLKNOWN FACT THE STORY OF OLD PRUE IN THE SECOND VOLUME WAS AN INCIDENT THAT FELL UNDER THE PERSONAL OBSERVATION OF A BROTHER OF THE WRITER THEN COLLECTINGCLERK TO A LARGE MERCANTILE HOUSE IN NEW ORLEANS FROM THE SAME SOURCE WAS DERIVED THE CHARACTER OF THE PLANTER LEGREE OF HIM HER BROTHER THUS WROTE SPEAKING OF VISITING HIS PLANTATION ON A COLLECTING TOUR HE ACTUALLY MADE ME FEEL OF HIS FIST WHICH WAS LIKE A BLACKSMITHS HAMMER OR A NODULE OF IRON TELLING ME THAT IT WAS CALLOUSED WITH KNOCKING DOWN NIGGERS WHEN I LEFT THE PLANTATION I DREW A LONG BREATH AND FELT AS IF I HAD ESCAPED FROM AN OGRES DEN THAT THE TRAGICAL FATE OF TOM ALSO HAS TOO MANY TIMES HAD ITS PARALLEL THERE ARE LIVING WITNESSES ALL OVER OUR LAND TO TESTIFY LET IT BE REMEMBERED THAT IN ALL SOUTHERN STATES IT IS A PRINCIPLE OF JURISPRUDENCE THAT NO PERSON OF COLORED LINEAGE CAN TESTIFY IN A SUIT AGAINST A WHITE AND IT WILL BE EASY TO SEE THAT SUCH A CASE MAY OCCUR WHEREVER THERE IS A MAN WHOSE PASSIONS OUTWEIGH HIS INTERESTS AND A SLAVE WHO HAS MANHOOD OR PRINCIPLE ENOUGH TO RESIST HIS WILL THERE IS ACTUALLY NOTHING TO PROTECT THE SLAVES LIFE BUT THE CHARACTER OF THE MASTER FACTS TOO SHOCKING TO BE CONTEMPLATED OCCASIONALLY FORCE THEIR WAY TO THE PUBLIC EAR AND THE COMMENT THAT ONE OFTEN HEARS MADE ON THEM IS MORE SHOCKING THAN THE THING ITSELF IT IS SAID VERY LIKELY SUCH CASES MAY NOW AND THEN OCCUR BUT THEY ARE NO SAMPLE OF GENERAL PRACTICE IF THE LAWS OF NEW ENGLAND WERE SO ARRANGED THAT A MASTER COULD NOW AND THEN TORTURE AN APPRENTICE TO DEATH WOULD IT BE RECEIVED WITH EQUAL COMPOSURE WOULD IT BE SAID THESE CASES ARE RARE AND NO SAMPLES OF GENERAL PRACTICE THIS INJUSTICE IS AN INHERENT ONE IN THE SLAVE SYSTEMIT CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT IT THE PUBLIC AND SHAMELESS SALE OF BEAUTIFUL MULATTO AND QUADROON GIRLS HAS ACQUIRED A NOTORIETY FROM THE INCIDENTS FOLLOWING THE CAPTURE OF THE PEARL WE EXTRACT THE FOLLOWING FROM THE SPEECH OF HON HORACE MANN ONE OF THE LEGAL COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANTS IN THAT CASE HE SAYS IN THAT COMPANY OF SEVENTYSIX PERSONS WHO ATTEMPTED IN TO ESCAPE FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN THE SCHOONER PEARL AND WHOSE OFFICERS I ASSISTED IN DEFENDING THERE WERE SEVERAL YOUNG AND HEALTHY GIRLS WHO HAD THOSE PECULIAR ATTRACTIONS OF FORM AND FEATURE WHICH CONNOISSEURS PRIZE SO HIGHLY ELIZABETH RUSSEL WAS ONE OF THEM SHE IMMEDIATELY FELL INTO THE SLAVETRADERS FANGS AND WAS DOOMED FOR THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET THE HEARTS OF THOSE THAT SAW HER WERE TOUCHED WITH PITY FOR HER FATE THEY OFFERED EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO REDEEM HER AND SOME THERE WERE WHO OFFERED TO GIVE THAT WOULD NOT HAVE MUCH LEFT AFTER THE GIFT BUT THE FIEND OF A SLAVETRADER WAS INEXORABLE SHE WAS DESPATCHED TO NEW ORLEANS BUT WHEN ABOUT HALF WAY THERE GOD HAD MERCY ON HER AND SMOTE HER WITH DEATH THERE WERE TWO GIRLS NAMED EDMUNDSON IN THE SAME COMPANY WHEN ABOUT TO BE SENT TO THE SAME MARKET AN OLDER SISTER WENT TO THE SHAMBLES TO PLEAD WITH THE WRETCH WHO OWNED THEM FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TO SPARE HIS VICTIMS HE BANTERED HER TELLING WHAT FINE DRESSES AND FINE FURNITURE THEY WOULD HAVE YES SHE SAID THAT MAY DO VERY WELL IN THIS LIFE BUT WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEM IN THE NEXT THEY TOO WERE SENT TO NEW ORLEANS BUT WERE AFTERWARDS REDEEMED AT AN ENORMOUS RANSOM AND BROUGHT BACK IS IT NOT PLAIN FROM THIS THAT THE HISTORIES OF EMMELINE AND CASSY MAY HAVE MANY COUNTERPARTS JUSTICE TOO OBLIGES THE AUTHOR TO STATE THAT THE FAIRNESS OF MIND AND GENEROSITY ATTRIBUTED TO ST CLARE ARE NOT WITHOUT A PARALLEL AS THE FOLLOWING ANECDOTE WILL SHOW A FEW YEARS SINCE A YOUNG SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN WAS IN CINCINNATI WITH A FAVORITE SERVANT WHO HAD BEEN HIS PERSONAL ATTENDANT FROM A BOY THE YOUNG MAN TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE HIS OWN FREEDOM AND FLED TO THE PROTECTION OF A QUAKER WHO WAS QUITE NOTED IN AFFAIRS OF THIS KIND THE OWNER WAS EXCEEDINGLY INDIGNANT HE HAD ALWAYS TREATED THE SLAVE WITH SUCH INDULGENCE AND HIS CONFIDENCE IN HIS AFFECTION WAS SUCH THAT HE BELIEVED HE MUST HAVE BEEN PRACTISED UPON TO INDUCE HIM TO REVOLT FROM HIM HE VISITED THE QUAKER IN HIGH ANGER BUT BEING POSSESSED OF UNCOMMON CANDOR AND FAIRNESS WAS SOON QUIETED BY HIS ARGUMENTS AND REPRESENTATIONS IT WAS A SIDE OF THE SUBJECT WHICH HE NEVER HAD HEARDNEVER HAD THOUGHT ON AND HE IMMEDIATELY TOLD THE QUAKER THAT IF HIS SLAVE WOULD TO HIS OWN FACE SAY THAT IT WAS HIS DESIRE TO BE FREE HE WOULD LIBERATE HIM AN INTERVIEW WAS FORTHWITH PROCURED AND NATHAN WAS ASKED BY HIS YOUNG MASTER WHETHER HE HAD EVER HAD ANY REASON TO COMPLAIN OF HIS TREATMENT IN ANY RESPECT NO MASR SAID NATHAN YOUVE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO ME WELL THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE ME MASR MAY DIE AND THEN WHO GET MEID RATHER BE A FREE MAN AFTER SOME DELIBERATION THE YOUNG MASTER REPLIED NATHAN IN YOUR PLACE I THINK I SHOULD FEEL VERY MUCH SO MYSELF YOU ARE FREE HE IMMEDIATELY MADE HIM OUT FREE PAPERS DEPOSITED A SUM OF MONEY IN THE HANDS OF THE QUAKER TO BE JUDICIOUSLY USED IN ASSISTING HIM TO START IN LIFE AND LEFT A VERY SENSIBLE AND KIND LETTER OF ADVICE TO THE YOUNG MAN THAT LETTER WAS FOR SOME TIME IN THE WRITERS HANDS THE AUTHOR HOPES SHE HAS DONE JUSTICE TO THAT NOBILITY GENEROSITY AND HUMANITY WHICH IN MANY CASES CHARACTERIZE INDIVIDUALS AT THE SOUTH SUCH INSTANCES SAVE US FROM UTTER DESPAIR OF OUR KIND BUT SHE ASKS ANY PERSON WHO KNOWS THE WORLD ARE SUCH CHARACTERS COMMON ANYWHERE FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE THE AUTHOR AVOIDED ALL READING UPON OR ALLUSION TO THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY CONSIDERING IT AS TOO PAINFUL TO BE INQUIRED INTO AND ONE WHICH ADVANCING LIGHT AND CIVILIZATION WOULD CERTAINLY LIVE DOWN BUT SINCE THE LEGISLATIVE ACT OF WHEN SHE HEARD WITH PERFECT SURPRISE AND CONSTERNATION CHRISTIAN AND HUMANE PEOPLE ACTUALLY RECOMMENDING THE REMANDING ESCAPED FUGITIVES INTO SLAVERY AS A DUTY BINDING ON GOOD CITIZENSWHEN SHE HEARD ON ALL HANDS FROM KIND COMPASSIONATE AND ESTIMABLE PEOPLE IN THE FREE STATES OF THE NORTH DELIBERATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS AS TO WHAT CHRISTIAN DUTY COULD BE ON THIS HEADSHE COULD ONLY THINK THESE MEN AND CHRISTIANS CANNOT KNOW WHAT SLAVERY IS IF THEY DID SUCH A QUESTION COULD NEVER BE OPEN FOR DISCUSSION AND FROM THIS AROSE A DESIRE TO EXHIBIT IT IN A LIVING DRAMATIC REALITY SHE HAS ENDEAVORED TO SHOW IT FAIRLY IN ITS BEST AND ITS WORST PHASES IN ITS BEST ASPECT SHE HAS PERHAPS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BUT OH WHO SHALL SAY WHAT YET REMAINS UNTOLD IN THAT VALLEY AND SHADOW OF DEATH THAT LIES THE OTHER SIDE TO YOU GENEROUS NOBLEMINDED MEN AND WOMEN OF THE SOUTHYOU WHOSE VIRTUE AND MAGNANIMITY AND PURITY OF CHARACTER ARE THE GREATER FOR THE SEVERER TRIAL IT HAS ENCOUNTEREDTO YOU IS HER APPEAL HAVE YOU NOT IN YOUR OWN SECRET SOULS IN YOUR OWN PRIVATE CONVERSINGS FELT THAT THERE ARE WOES AND EVILS IN THIS ACCURSED SYSTEM FAR BEYOND WHAT ARE HERE SHADOWED OR CAN BE SHADOWED CAN IT BE OTHERWISE IS MAN EVER A CREATURE TO BE TRUSTED WITH WHOLLY IRRESPONSIBLE POWER AND DOES NOT THE SLAVE SYSTEM BY DENYING THE SLAVE ALL LEGAL RIGHT OF TESTIMONY MAKE EVERY INDIVIDUAL OWNER AN IRRESPONSIBLE DESPOT CAN ANYBODY FAIL TO MAKE THE INFERENCE WHAT THE PRACTICAL RESULT WILL BE IF THERE IS AS WE ADMIT A PUBLIC SENTIMENT AMONG YOU MEN OF HONOR JUSTICE AND HUMANITY IS THERE NOT ALSO ANOTHER KIND OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT AMONG THE RUFFIAN THE BRUTAL AND DEBASED AND CANNOT THE RUFFIAN THE BRUTAL THE DEBASED BY SLAVE LAW OWN JUST AS MANY SLAVES AS THE BEST AND PUREST ARE THE HONORABLE THE JUST THE HIGHMINDED AND COMPASSIONATE THE MAJORITY ANYWHERE IN THIS WORLD THE SLAVETRADE IS NOW BY AMERICAN LAW CONSIDERED AS PIRACY BUT A SLAVETRADE AS SYSTEMATIC AS EVER WAS CARRIED ON ON THE COAST OF AFRICA IS AN INEVITABLE ATTENDANT AND RESULT OF AMERICAN SLAVERY AND ITS HEARTBREAK AND ITS HORRORS CAN THEY BE TOLD THE WRITER HAS GIVEN ONLY A FAINT SHADOW A DIM PICTURE OF THE ANGUISH AND DESPAIR THAT ARE AT THIS VERY MOMENT RIVING THOUSANDS OF HEARTS SHATTERING THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES AND DRIVING A HELPLESS AND SENSITIVE RACE TO FRENZY AND DESPAIR THERE ARE THOSE LIVING WHO KNOW THE MOTHERS WHOM THIS ACCURSED TRAFFIC HAS DRIVEN TO THE MURDER OF THEIR CHILDREN AND THEMSELVES SEEKING IN DEATH A SHELTER FROM WOES MORE DREADED THAN DEATH NOTHING OF TRAGEDY CAN BE WRITTEN CAN BE SPOKEN CAN BE CONCEIVED THAT EQUALS THE FRIGHTFUL REALITY OF SCENES DAILY AND HOURLY ACTING ON OUR SHORES BENEATH THE SHADOW OF AMERICAN LAW AND THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS OF CHRIST AND NOW MEN AND WOMEN OF AMERICA IS THIS A THING TO BE TRIFLED WITH APOLOGIZED FOR AND PASSED OVER IN SILENCE FARMERS OF MASSACHUSETTS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE OF VERMONT OF CONNECTICUT WHO READ THIS BOOK BY THE BLAZE OF YOUR WINTEREVENING FIRESTRONGHEARTED GENEROUS SAILORS AND SHIPOWNERS OF MAINEIS THIS A THING FOR YOU TO COUNTENANCE AND ENCOURAGE BRAVE AND GENEROUS MEN OF NEW YORK FARMERS OF RICH AND JOYOUS OHIO AND YE OF THE WIDE PRAIRIE STATESANSWER IS THIS A THING FOR YOU TO PROTECT AND COUNTENANCE AND YOU MOTHERS OF AMERICAYOU WHO HAVE LEARNED BY THE CRADLES OF YOUR OWN CHILDREN TO LOVE AND FEEL FOR ALL MANKINDBY THE SACRED LOVE YOU BEAR YOUR CHILD BY YOUR JOY IN HIS BEAUTIFUL SPOTLESS INFANCY BY THE MOTHERLY PITY AND TENDERNESS WITH WHICH YOU GUIDE HIS GROWING YEARS BY THE ANXIETIES OF HIS EDUCATION BY THE PRAYERS YOU BREATHE FOR HIS SOULS ETERNAL GOODI BESEECH YOU PITY THE MOTHER WHO HAS ALL YOUR AFFECTIONS AND NOT ONE LEGAL RIGHT TO PROTECT GUIDE OR EDUCATE THE CHILD OF HER BOSOM BY THE SICK HOUR OF YOUR CHILD BY THOSE DYING EYES WHICH YOU CAN NEVER FORGET BY THOSE LAST CRIES THAT WRUNG YOUR HEART WHEN YOU COULD NEITHER HELP NOR SAVE BY THE DESOLATION OF THAT EMPTY CRADLE THAT SILENT NURSERYI BESEECH YOU PITY THOSE MOTHERS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY MADE CHILDLESS BY THE AMERICAN SLAVETRADE AND SAY MOTHERS OF AMERICA IS THIS A THING TO BE DEFENDED SYMPATHIZED WITH PASSED OVER IN SILENCE DO YOU SAY THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE FREE STATE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND CAN DO NOTHING WOULD TO GOD THIS WERE TRUE BUT IT IS NOT TRUE THE PEOPLE OF THE FREE STATES HAVE DEFENDED ENCOURAGED AND PARTICIPATED AND ARE MORE GUILTY FOR IT BEFORE GOD THAN THE SOUTH IN THAT THEY HAVE NOT THE APOLOGY OF EDUCATION OR CUSTOM IF THE MOTHERS OF THE FREE STATES HAD ALL FELT AS THEY SHOULD IN TIMES PAST THE SONS OF THE FREE STATES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE HOLDERS AND PROVERBIALLY THE HARDEST MASTERS OF SLAVES THE SONS OF THE FREE STATES WOULD NOT HAVE CONNIVED AT THE EXTENSION OF SLAVERY IN OUR NATIONAL BODY THE SONS OF THE FREE STATES WOULD NOT AS THEY DO TRADE THE SOULS AND BODIES OF MEN AS AN EQUIVALENT TO MONEY IN THEIR MERCANTILE DEALINGS THERE ARE MULTITUDES OF SLAVES TEMPORARILY OWNED AND SOLD AGAIN BY MERCHANTS IN NORTHERN CITIES AND SHALL THE WHOLE GUILT OR OBLOQUY OF SLAVERY FALL ONLY ON THE SOUTH NORTHERN MEN NORTHERN MOTHERS NORTHERN CHRISTIANS HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO DO THAN DENOUNCE THEIR BRETHREN AT THE SOUTH THEY HAVE TO LOOK TO THE EVIL AMONG THEMSELVES BUT WHAT CAN ANY INDIVIDUAL DO OF THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN JUDGE THERE IS ONE THING THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN DOTHEY CAN SEE TO IT THAT THEY FEEL RIGHT AN ATMOSPHERE OF SYMPATHETIC INFLUENCE ENCIRCLES EVERY HUMAN BEING AND THE MAN OR WOMAN WHO FEELS STRONGLY HEALTHILY AND JUSTLY ON THE GREAT INTERESTS OF HUMANITY IS A CONSTANT BENEFACTOR TO THE HUMAN RACE SEE THEN TO YOUR SYMPATHIES IN THIS MATTER ARE THEY IN HARMONY WITH THE SYMPATHIES OF CHRIST OR ARE THEY SWAYED AND PERVERTED BY THE SOPHISTRIES OF WORLDLY POLICY CHRISTIAN MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NORTH STILL FURTHERYOU HAVE ANOTHER POWER YOU CAN PRAY DO YOU BELIEVE IN PRAYER OR HAS IT BECOME AN INDISTINCT APOSTOLIC TRADITION YOU PRAY FOR THE HEATHEN ABROAD PRAY ALSO FOR THE HEATHEN AT HOME AND PRAY FOR THOSE DISTRESSED CHRISTIANS WHOSE WHOLE CHANCE OF RELIGIOUS IMPROVEMENT IS AN ACCIDENT OF TRADE AND SALE FROM WHOM ANY ADHERENCE TO THE MORALS OF CHRISTIANITY IS IN MANY CASES AN IMPOSSIBILITY UNLESS THEY HAVE GIVEN THEM FROM ABOVE THE COURAGE AND GRACE OF MARTYRDOM BUT STILL MORE ON THE SHORES OF OUR FREE STATES ARE EMERGING THE POOR SHATTERED BROKEN REMNANTS OF FAMILIESMEN AND WOMEN ESCAPED BY MIRACULOUS PROVIDENCES FROM THE SURGES OF SLAVERYFEEBLE IN KNOWLEDGE AND IN MANY CASES INFIRM IN MORAL CONSTITUTION FROM A SYSTEM WHICH CONFOUNDS AND CONFUSES EVERY PRINCIPLE OF CHRISTIANITY AND MORALITY THEY COME TO SEEK A REFUGE AMONG YOU THEY COME TO SEEK EDUCATION KNOWLEDGE CHRISTIANITY WHAT DO YOU OWE TO THESE POOR UNFORTUNATES OH CHRISTIANS DOES NOT EVERY AMERICAN CHRISTIAN OWE TO THE AFRICAN RACE SOME EFFORT AT REPARATION FOR THE WRONGS THAT THE AMERICAN NATION HAS BROUGHT UPON THEM SHALL THE DOORS OF CHURCHES AND SCHOOLHOUSES BE SHUT UPON THEM SHALL STATES ARISE AND SHAKE THEM OUT SHALL THE CHURCH OF CHRIST HEAR IN SILENCE THE TAUNT THAT IS THROWN AT THEM AND SHRINK AWAY FROM THE HELPLESS HAND THAT THEY STRETCH OUT AND BY HER SILENCE ENCOURAGE THE CRUELTY THAT WOULD CHASE THEM FROM OUR BORDERS IF IT MUST BE SO IT WILL BE A MOURNFUL SPECTACLE IF IT MUST BE SO THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE REASON TO TREMBLE WHEN IT REMEMBERS THAT THE FATE OF NATIONS IS IN THE HANDS OF ONE WHO IS VERY PITIFUL AND OF TENDER COMPASSION DO YOU SAY WE DONT WANT THEM HERE LET THEM GO TO AFRICA THAT THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD HAS PROVIDED A REFUGE IN AFRICA IS INDEED A GREAT AND NOTICEABLE FACT BUT THAT IS NO REASON WHY THE CHURCH OF CHRIST SHOULD THROW OFF THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS OUTCAST RACE WHICH HER PROFESSION DEMANDS OF HER TO FILL UP LIBERIA WITH AN IGNORANT INEXPERIENCED HALFBARBARIZED RACE JUST ESCAPED FROM THE CHAINS OF SLAVERY WOULD BE ONLY TO PROLONG FOR AGES THE PERIOD OF STRUGGLE AND CONFLICT WHICH ATTENDS THE INCEPTION OF NEW ENTERPRISES LET THE CHURCH OF THE NORTH RECEIVE THESE POOR SUFFERERS IN THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST RECEIVE THEM TO THE EDUCATING ADVANTAGES OF CHRISTIAN REPUBLICAN SOCIETY AND SCHOOLS UNTIL THEY HAVE ATTAINED TO SOMEWHAT OF A MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL MATURITY AND THEN ASSIST THEM IN THEIR PASSAGE TO THOSE SHORES WHERE THEY MAY PUT IN PRACTICE THE LESSONS THEY HAVE LEARNED IN AMERICA THERE IS A BODY OF MEN AT THE NORTH COMPARATIVELY SMALL WHO HAVE BEEN DOING THIS AND AS THE RESULT THIS COUNTRY HAS ALREADY SEEN EXAMPLES OF MEN FORMERLY SLAVES WHO HAVE RAPIDLY ACQUIRED PROPERTY REPUTATION AND EDUCATION TALENT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WHICH CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES IS CERTAINLY REMARKABLE AND FOR MORAL TRAITS OF HONESTY KINDNESS TENDERNESS OF FEELINGFOR HEROIC EFFORTS AND SELFDENIALS ENDURED FOR THE RANSOM OF BRETHREN AND FRIENDS YET IN SLAVERYTHEY HAVE BEEN REMARKABLE TO A DEGREE THAT CONSIDERING THE INFLUENCE UNDER WHICH THEY WERE BORN IS SURPRISING THE WRITER HAS LIVED FOR MANY YEARS ON THE FRONTIERLINE OF SLAVE STATES AND HAS HAD GREAT OPPORTUNITIES OF OBSERVATION AMONG THOSE WHO FORMERLY WERE SLAVES THEY HAVE BEEN IN HER FAMILY AS SERVANTS AND IN DEFAULT OF ANY OTHER SCHOOL TO RECEIVE THEM SHE HAS IN MANY CASES HAD THEM INSTRUCTED IN A FAMILY SCHOOL WITH HER OWN CHILDREN SHE HAS ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF MISSIONARIES AMONG THE FUGITIVES IN CANADA IN COINCIDENCE WITH HER OWN EXPERIENCE AND HER DEDUCTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE CAPABILITIES OF THE RACE ARE ENCOURAGING IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE THE FIRST DESIRE OF THE EMANCIPATED SLAVE GENERALLY IS FOR EDUCATION THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE OR DO TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN INSTRUCTED AND SO FAR AS THE WRITER HAS OBSERVED HERSELF OR TAKEN THE TESTIMONY OF TEACHERS AMONG THEM THEY ARE REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT AND QUICK TO LEARN THE RESULTS OF SCHOOLS FOUNDED FOR THEM BY BENEVOLENT INDIVIDUALS IN CINCINNATI

PERSEVERING SELFDENIAL RAISED NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR HER HUSBANDS FREEDOM WHICH SHE PAID AS SHE RAISED IT INTO THE HANDS OF HIS MASTER SHE YET WANTED A HUNDRED DOLLARS OF THE PRICE WHEN HE DIED SHE NEVER RECOVERED ANY OF THE MONEY THESE ARE BUT FEW FACTS AMONG MULTITUDES WHICH MIGHT BE ADDUCED TO SHOW THE SELFDENIAL ENERGY PATIENCE AND HONESTY WHICH THE SLAVE HAS EXHIBITED IN A STATE OF FREEDOM

COLORED MAN BY THE LAW OF OHIO CANNOT BE A VOTER AND TILL WITHIN A FEW YEARS WAS EVEN DENIED THE RIGHT OF TESTIMONY IN LEGAL SUITS WITH THE WHITE NOR ARE THESE INSTANCES CONFINED TO THE STATE OF OHIO
