NURSE AT THE BIG HOSPITAL IN MIDDLINGHAM A MANUFACTURING TOWN SOME FIFTEEN MILES AWAY AND BEGGING ME TO LET HER KNOW IF MRS INGLETHORP SHOULD SHOW ANY WISH TO BE RECONCILED THE ONLY FLY IN THE

TO ME LAWRENCE REMAINED BEHIND BUT AFTER A FEW MOMENTS CYNTHIA CALLED TO HIM OVER HER SHOULDER TO COME AND JOIN US THEN SHE LOOKED AT HER WATCH NOTHING MORE TO DO NIBS NO ALL RIGHT THEN WE CAN LOCK UP AND GO I HAD SEEN LAWRENCE IN QUITE A DIFFERENT LIGHT THAT AFTERNOON COMPARED TO JOHN HE WAS AN ASTOUNDINGLY DIFFICULT PERSON TO GET TO KNOW HE WAS THE OPPOSITE OF HIS BROTHER IN ALMOST EVERY RESPECT BEING UNUSUALLY SHY AND RESERVED YET HE HAD A CERTAIN CHARM OF MANNER AND I FANCIED THAT IF ONE REALLY KNEW HIM WELL ONE COULD HAVE A DEEP AFFECTION FOR HIM I HAD ALWAYS FANCIED THAT HIS MANNER TO CYNTHIA WAS RATHER CONSTRAINED AND THAT SHE ON HER SIDE WAS INCLINED TO BE SHY OF HIM BUT THEY WERE BOTH GAY ENOUGH THIS AFTERNOON AND CHATTED TOGETHER LIKE A COUPLE OF CHILDREN AS WE DROVE THROUGH THE VILLAGE I REMEMBERED THAT I WANTED SOME STAMPS SO ACCORDINGLY WE PULLED UP AT THE POST OFFICE AS I CAME OUT AGAIN I CANNONED INTO A LITTLE MAN WHO WAS JUST ENTERING I DREW ASIDE AND APOLOGISED

MORE THAN FIVE FEET FOUR INCHES BUT CARRIED HIMSELF WITH GREAT DIGNITY HIS HEAD WAS EXACTLY THE SHAPE OF AN EGG AND HE ALWAYS PERCHED IT A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE HIS MOUSTACHE WAS VERY STIFF AND MILITARY THE NEATNESS OF HIS ATTIRE WAS ALMOST INCREDIBLE I BELIEVE A SPECK OF DUST WOULD HAVE CAUSED HIM MORE PAIN THAN A BULLET WOUND YET THIS QUAINT DANDIFIED LITTLE MAN WHO I WAS SORRY TO SEE NOW LIMPED BADLY HAD BEEN IN HIS TIME ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED MEMBERS OF THE BELGIAN POLICE AS A DETECTIVE HIS FLAIR HAD BEEN EXTRAORDINARY AND HE HAD ACHIEVED TRIUMPHS BY UNRAVELLING SOME OF THE MOST BAFFLING CASES OF THE DAY HE POINTED OUT TO ME THE LITTLE HOUSE INHABITED BY HIM AND HIS FELLOW BELGIANS AND I PROMISED TO GO AND SEE HIM AT AN EARLY DATE THEN HE RAISED HIS HAT WITH A FLOURISH TO

ESTATE ACCOUNTS HE TURNED TO JOHN NO ONE NEED SIT UP I WILL TAKE THE LATCHKEY CHAPTER III THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY TO MAKE THIS PART OF MY STORY CLEAR I APPEND THE FOLLOWING PLAN OF THE FIRST FLOOR OF STYLES THE SERVANTS ROOMS ARE REACHED THROUGH THE DOOR B THEY HAVE NO COMMUNICATION WITH THE RIGHT WING WHERE THE INGLETHORPS ROOMS WERE SITUATED IT SEEMED TO BE THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AWAKENED BY LAWRENCE CAVENDISH HE HAD A CANDLE IN HIS HAND AND THE AGITATION OF HIS FACE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT SOMETHING WAS SERIOUSLY WRONG WHATS THE MATTER I ASKED SITTING UP IN BED AND TRYING TO COLLECT MY SCATTERED THOUGHTS WE ARE AFRAID MY MOTHER IS VERY ILL SHE SEEMS TO BE HAVING SOME KIND OF FIT UNFORTUNATELY SHE HAS LOCKED HERSELF IN ILL COME AT ONCE I SPRANG OUT OF BED AND PULLING ON A DRESSINGGOWN FOLLOWED LAWRENCE ALONG THE PASSAGE AND THE GALLERY TO THE RIGHT WING OF THE HOUSE JOHN CAVENDISH JOINED US AND ONE OR TWO OF THE SERVANTS WERE STANDING ROUND IN A STATE OF AWESTRICKEN EXCITEMENT LAWRENCE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER WHAT DO YOU THINK WE HAD BETTER DO NEVER I THOUGHT HAD HIS INDECISION OF CHARACTER BEEN MORE APPARENT JOHN RATTLED THE HANDLE OF MRS INGLETHORPS DOOR VIOLENTLY BUT WITH NO EFFECT IT WAS OBVIOUSLY LOCKED OR BOLTED ON THE INSIDE THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD WAS AROUSED BY NOW THE MOST ALARMING SOUNDS WERE AUDIBLE FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE ROOM CLEARLY SOMETHING MUST BE DONE TRY GOING THROUGH MR INGLETHORPS ROOM SIR CRIED DORCAS OH THE POOR MISTRESS SUDDENLY I REALIZED THAT ALFRED INGLETHORP WAS NOT WITH USTHAT HE ALONE HAD GIVEN NO SIGN OF HIS PRESENCE JOHN OPENED THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM IT WAS PITCH DARK BUT LAWRENCE WAS FOLLOWING WITH THE CANDLE AND BY ITS FEEBLE LIGHT WE SAW THAT THE BED HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT IN AND THAT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE ROOM HAVING BEEN OCCUPIED WE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CONNECTING DOOR THAT TOO WAS LOCKED OR BOLTED ON THE INSIDE WHAT WAS TO BE DONE OH DEAR SIR CRIED DORCAS WRINGING HER HANDS WHAT EVER SHALL WE DO WE MUST TRY AND BREAK THE DOOR IN I SUPPOSE ITLL BE A TOUGH JOB THOUGH HERE LET ONE OF THE MAIDS GO DOWN AND WAKE BAILY AND TELL HIM TO GO FOR DR WILKINS AT ONCE NOW THEN WELL HAVE A TRY AT THE DOOR HALF A MOMENT THOUGH ISNT THERE A DOOR INTO MISS CYNTHIAS ROOMS YES SIR BUT THATS ALWAYS BOLTED ITS NEVER BEEN UNDONE WELL WE MIGHT JUST SEE HE RAN RAPIDLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR TO CYNTHIAS ROOM MARY CAVENDISH WAS THERE SHAKING THE GIRLWHO MUST HAVE BEEN AN UNUSUALLY SOUND SLEEPERAND TRYING TO WAKE HER IN A MOMENT OR TWO HE WAS BACK NO GOOD THATS BOLTED TOO WE MUST BREAK IN THE DOOR I THINK THIS ONE IS A SHADE LESS SOLID THAN THE ONE IN THE PASSAGE WE STRAINED AND HEAVED TOGETHER THE FRAMEWORK OF THE DOOR WAS SOLID AND FOR A LONG TIME IT RESISTED OUR EFFORTS BUT AT LAST WE FELT IT GIVE BENEATH OUR WEIGHT AND FINALLY WITH A RESOUNDING CRASH IT WAS BURST OPEN WE STUMBLED IN TOGETHER LAWRENCE STILL HOLDING HIS CANDLE MRS INGLETHORP WAS LYING ON THE BED HER WHOLE FORM AGITATED BY VIOLENT CONVULSIONS IN ONE OF WHICH SHE MUST HAVE OVERTURNED THE TABLE BESIDE HER AS WE ENTERED HOWEVER HER LIMBS RELAXED AND SHE FELL BACK UPON THE PILLOWS JOHN STRODE ACROSS THE ROOM AND LIT THE GAS TURNING TO ANNIE ONE OF THE HOUSEMAIDS HE SENT HER DOWNSTAIRS TO THE DININGROOM FOR BRANDY THEN HE WENT ACROSS TO HIS MOTHER WHILST I UNBOLTED THE DOOR THAT GAVE ON THE CORRIDOR I TURNED TO LAWRENCE TO SUGGEST THAT I HAD BETTER LEAVE THEM NOW THAT THERE WAS NO FURTHER NEED OF MY SERVICES BUT THE WORDS WERE FROZEN ON MY LIPS NEVER HAVE I SEEN SUCH A GHASTLY LOOK ON ANY MANS FACE HE WAS WHITE AS CHALK THE CANDLE HE HELD IN HIS SHAKING HAND WAS SPUTTERING ONTO THE CARPET AND HIS EYES PETRIFIED WITH TERROR OR SOME SUCH KINDRED EMOTION STARED FIXEDLY OVER MY HEAD AT A POINT ON THE FURTHER WALL IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD SEEN SOMETHING THAT TURNED HIM TO STONE I INSTINCTIVELY FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION OF HIS EYES BUT I COULD SEE NOTHING UNUSUAL THE STILL FEEBLY FLICKERING ASHES IN THE GRATE AND THE ROW OF PRIM ORNAMENTS ON THE MANTELPIECE WERE SURELY HARMLESS ENOUGH THE VIOLENCE OF MRS INGLETHORPS ATTACK SEEMED TO BE PASSING SHE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK IN SHORT GASPS BETTER NOWVERY SUDDENSTUPID OF METO LOCK MYSELF IN A SHADOW FELL ON THE BED AND LOOKING UP I SAW MARY CAVENDISH STANDING NEAR THE DOOR WITH HER ARM AROUND CYNTHIA SHE SEEMED TO BE SUPPORTING THE GIRL WHO LOOKED UTTERLY DAZED AND UNLIKE HERSELF HER FACE WAS HEAVILY FLUSHED AND SHE YAWNED REPEATEDLY POOR CYNTHIA IS QUITE FRIGHTENED SAID MRS CAVENDISH IN A LOW CLEAR VOICE SHE HERSELF I NOTICED WAS DRESSED IN HER WHITE LAND SMOCK THEN IT MUST BE LATER THAN I THOUGHT I SAW THAT A FAINT STREAK OF DAYLIGHT WAS SHOWING THROUGH THE CURTAINS OF THE WINDOWS AND THAT THE CLOCK ON THE MANTELPIECE POINTED TO CLOSE UPON FIVE OCLOCK A STRANGLED CRY FROM THE BED STARTLED ME A FRESH ACCESS OF PAIN SEIZED THE UNFORTUNATE OLD LADY THE CONVULSIONS WERE OF A VIOLENCE TERRIBLE TO BEHOLD EVERYTHING WAS CONFUSION WE THRONGED ROUND HER POWERLESS TO HELP OR ALLEVIATE A FINAL CONVULSION LIFTED HER FROM THE BED UNTIL SHE APPEARED TO REST UPON HER HEAD AND HER HEELS WITH HER BODY ARCHED IN AN EXTRAORDINARY MANNER IN VAIN MARY AND JOHN TRIED TO ADMINISTER MORE BRANDY THE MOMENTS FLEW AGAIN THE BODY ARCHED ITSELF IN THAT PECULIAR FASHION AT THAT MOMENT DR BAUERSTEIN PUSHED HIS WAY AUTHORITATIVELY INTO THE ROOM FOR ONE INSTANT HE STOPPED DEAD STARING AT THE FIGURE ON THE BED AND AT THE SAME INSTANT MRS INGLETHORP CRIED OUT IN A STRANGLED VOICE HER EYES FIXED ON THE DOCTOR ALFREDALFRED THEN SHE FELL BACK MOTIONLESS ON THE PILLOWS WITH A STRIDE THE DOCTOR REACHED THE BED AND SEIZING HER ARMS WORKED THEM ENERGETICALLY APPLYING WHAT I KNEW TO BE ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION HE ISSUED A FEW SHORT SHARP ORDERS TO THE SERVANTS AN IMPERIOUS WAVE OF HIS HAND DROVE US ALL TO THE DOOR WE WATCHED HIM FASCINATED THOUGH I THINK WE ALL KNEW IN OUR HEARTS THAT IT WAS TOO LATE AND THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE NOW I COULD SEE BY THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE THAT HE HIMSELF HAD LITTLE HOPE FINALLY HE ABANDONED HIS TASK SHAKING HIS HEAD GRAVELY AT THAT MOMENT WE HEARD FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE AND DR WILKINS MRS INGLETHORPS OWN DOCTOR A PORTLY FUSSY LITTLE MAN CAME BUSTLING IN IN A FEW WORDS DR BAUERSTEIN EXPLAINED HOW HE HAD HAPPENED TO BE PASSING THE LODGE GATES AS THE CAR CAME OUT AND HAD RUN UP TO THE HOUSE AS FAST AS HE COULD WHILST THE CAR WENT ON TO FETCH DR WILKINS WITH A FAINT GESTURE OF THE HAND HE INDICATED THE FIGURE ON THE BED VERY SAD VERY SAD MURMURED DR WILKINS POOR DEAR LADY ALWAYS DID FAR TOO MUCHFAR TOO MUCHAGAINST MY ADVICE I WARNED HER HER HEART WAS FAR FROM STRONG TAKE IT EASY I SAID TO HER TAKEITEASY BUT NOHER ZEAL FOR GOOD WORKS WAS TOO GREAT NATURE REBELLED NATUREREBELLED DR BAUERSTEIN I

THEM THEY WERE QUITETETANIC IN CHARACTER AH SAID DR WILKINS WISELY I SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU IN PRIVATE SAID DR BAUERSTEIN HE TURNED TO JOHN YOU DO NOT OBJECT CERTAINLY NOT WE ALL TROOPED OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR LEAVING THE TWO DOCTORS ALONE AND I HEARD THE KEY TURNED IN THE LOCK BEHIND US WE WENT SLOWLY DOWN THE STAIRS I WAS VIOLENTLY EXCITED I HAVE A CERTAIN TALENT FOR DEDUCTION AND DR BAUERSTEINS MANNER HAD STARTED A FLOCK OF WILD SURMISES IN MY MIND MARY CAVENDISH LAID HER HAND UPON MY ARM WHAT IS IT WHY DID DR BAUERSTEIN SEEM SOPECULIAR I LOOKED AT HER DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WHAT LISTEN I LOOKED ROUND THE OTHERS WERE OUT OF EARSHOT I LOWERED MY VOICE TO A WHISPER I BELIEVE SHE HAS BEEN POISONED IM CERTAIN DR BAUERSTEIN SUSPECTS IT WHAT SHE SHRANK AGAINST THE WALL THE PUPILS OF HER EYES DILATING WILDLY THEN WITH A SUDDEN CRY THAT STARTLED ME SHE CRIED OUT NO NONOT THATNOT THAT AND BREAKING FROM ME FLED UP THE STAIRS I FOLLOWED HER AFRAID THAT SHE WAS GOING TO FAINT I FOUND HER LEANING AGAINST THE BANNISTERS DEADLY PALE SHE WAVED ME AWAY IMPATIENTLY NO NOLEAVE ME ID RATHER BE ALONE LET ME JUST BE QUIET FOR A MINUTE OR TWO GO DOWN TO THE OTHERS I OBEYED HER RELUCTANTLY JOHN AND LAWRENCE WERE IN THE DININGROOM I JOINED THEM WE WERE ALL SILENT BUT I SUPPOSE I VOICED THE THOUGHTS OF US ALL WHEN I AT LAST BROKE IT BY SAYING WHERE IS MR INGLETHORP JOHN SHOOK HIS HEAD HES NOT IN THE HOUSE OUR EYES MET WHERE WAS ALFRED INGLETHORP HIS ABSENCE WAS STRANGE AND INEXPLICABLE I REMEMBERED MRS INGLETHORPS DYING WORDS WHAT LAY BENEATH THEM WHAT MORE COULD SHE HAVE TOLD US IF SHE HAD HAD TIME AT LAST WE HEARD THE DOCTORS DESCENDING THE STAIRS DR WILKINS WAS LOOKING IMPORTANT AND EXCITED AND TRYING TO CONCEAL AN INWARD EXULTATION UNDER A MANNER OF DECOROUS CALM DR BAUERSTEIN REMAINED IN THE BACKGROUND HIS GRAVE BEARDED FACE UNCHANGED DR WILKINS WAS THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE TWO HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO JOHN MR CAVENDISH I SHOULD LIKE YOUR CONSENT TO A POSTMORTEM IS THAT NECESSARY ASKED JOHN GRAVELY A SPASM OF PAIN CROSSED HIS FACE ABSOLUTELY SAID DR BAUERSTEIN YOU MEAN BY THAT THAT NEITHER DR WILKINS NOR MYSELF COULD GIVE A DEATH CERTIFICATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES JOHN BENT HIS HEAD IN THAT CASE I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO AGREE THANK YOU SAID DR WILKINS BRISKLY WE PROPOSE THAT IT SHOULD TAKE PLACE TOMORROW NIGHTOR RATHER TONIGHT AND HE GLANCED AT THE DAYLIGHT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I AM AFRAID AN INQUEST CAN HARDLY BE AVOIDEDTHESE FORMALITIES ARE NECESSARY BUT I BEG THAT YOU WONT DISTRESS YOURSELVES THERE WAS A PAUSE AND THEN DR BAUERSTEIN DREW TWO KEYS FROM HIS POCKET AND HANDED THEM TO JOHN THESE ARE THE KEYS OF THE TWO ROOMS I HAVE LOCKED THEM AND IN MY OPINION THEY WOULD BE BETTER KEPT LOCKED FOR THE PRESENT THE DOCTORS THEN DEPARTED I HAD BEEN TURNING OVER AN IDEA IN MY HEAD AND I FELT THAT THE MOMENT HAD NOW COME TO BROACH IT YET I WAS A LITTLE CHARY OF DOING SO JOHN I KNEW HAD A HORROR OF ANY KIND OF PUBLICITY AND WAS AN EASYGOING OPTIMIST WHO PREFERRED NEVER TO MEET TROUBLE HALFWAY IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE HIM OF THE SOUNDNESS OF MY PLAN LAWRENCE ON THE OTHER HAND BEING LESS CONVENTIONAL AND HAVING MORE IMAGINATION I FELT I MIGHT COUNT UPON AS AN ALLY THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME FOR ME TO TAKE THE LEAD JOHN I SAID I AM GOING TO ASK YOU SOMETHING WELL YOU REMEMBER MY SPEAKING OF MY FRIEND POIROT THE BELGIAN WHO IS HERE HE HAS BEEN A MOST FAMOUS DETECTIVE YES I WANT YOU TO LET ME CALL HIM INTO INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER WHATNOW BEFORE THE POSTMORTEM YES TIME IS AN ADVANTAGE

LIKE ALL SPECIALISTS BAUERSTEINS GOT A BEE IN HIS BONNET POISONS ARE HIS HOBBY SO OF COURSE HE SEES THEM EVERYWHERE I CONFESS THAT I WAS SURPRISED BY LAWRENCES ATTITUDE HE WAS SO SELDOM VEHEMENT ABOUT ANYTHING JOHN HESITATED I CANT FEEL AS YOU DO LAWRENCE HE SAID AT LAST IM INCLINED TO GIVE HASTINGS A FREE HAND THOUGH I SHOULD PREFER TO WAIT A BIT WE DONT WANT ANY UNNECESSARY SCANDAL NO NO I CRIED EAGERLY YOU NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF THAT POIROT IS DISCRETION ITSELF VERY WELL THEN HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY I LEAVE IT IN YOUR HANDS THOUGH IF IT IS AS WE SUSPECT IT SEEMS A CLEAR ENOUGH CASE GOD FORGIVE ME IF I AM WRONGING HIM I LOOKED AT MY WATCH IT WAS SIX OCLOCK I DETERMINED TO LOSE NO TIME FIVE MINUTES DELAY HOWEVER I ALLOWED MYSELF I SPENT IT IN RANSACKING THE LIBRARY UNTIL I DISCOVERED A MEDICAL BOOK WHICH GAVE A DESCRIPTION OF STRYCHNINE POISONING CHAPTER IV POIROT INVESTIGATES THE HOUSE WHICH THE BELGIANS OCCUPIED IN THE VILLAGE WAS QUITE CLOSE TO THE PARK GATES ONE COULD SAVE TIME BY TAKING A NARROW PATH THROUGH THE LONG GRASS WHICH CUT OFF THE DETOURS OF THE WINDING DRIVE SO I ACCORDINGLY WENT THAT WAY I HAD NEARLY REACHED THE LODGE WHEN MY ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY THE RUNNING

COFFEE SERVED ABOUT EIGHT OCLOCK THEREFORE SHE DRANK IT BETWEEN THEN AND HALFPAST EIGHTCERTAINLY NOT MUCH LATER WELL STRYCHNINE IS A FAIRLY RAPID POISON ITS EFFECTS WOULD BE FELT VERY SOON PROBABLY IN ABOUT AN HOUR YET IN MRS INGLETHORPS CASE THE SYMPTOMS DO NOT MANIFEST THEMSELVES UNTIL FIVE OCLOCK THE NEXT MORNING NINE HOURS BUT A HEAVY MEAL TAKEN AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE POISON MIGHT RETARD ITS EFFECTS THOUGH HARDLY TO THAT EXTENT STILL IT IS A POSSIBILITY TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BUT ACCORDING TO YOU SHE ATE VERY LITTLE FOR SUPPER AND YET THE SYMPTOMS DO NOT DEVELOP UNTIL EARLY THE NEXT MORNING NOW THAT IS A CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE MY FRIEND SOMETHING MAY ARISE AT THE AUTOPSY TO EXPLAIN IT IN THE MEANTIME REMEMBER IT AS WE NEARED THE HOUSE JOHN CAME OUT AND MET US HIS FACE LOOKED WEARY AND HAGGARD THIS IS A VERY DREADFUL BUSINESS MONSIEUR POIROT HE SAID HASTINGS HAS EXPLAINED TO YOU THAT WE ARE ANXIOUS FOR NO PUBLICITY I COMPREHEND PERFECTLY YOU SEE IT IS ONLY SUSPICION SO FAR WE HAVE NOTHING TO GO UPON PRECISELY IT IS A MATTER OF PRECAUTION ONLY JOHN TURNED TO ME TAKING OUT HIS CIGARETTECASE AND LIGHTING A CIGARETTE AS HE DID SO YOU KNOW THAT FELLOW INGLETHORP IS BACK YES I MET HIM JOHN FLUNG THE MATCH INTO AN ADJACENT FLOWER BED A PROCEEDING WHICH WAS TOO MUCH FOR POIROTS FEELINGS HE RETRIEVED IT AND BURIED IT NEATLY ITS JOLLY DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW TO TREAT HIM THAT DIFFICULTY WILL NOT EXIST LONG PRONOUNCED POIROT QUIETLY JOHN LOOKED PUZZLED NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE PORTENT OF THIS CRYPTIC SAYING HE HANDED THE TWO KEYS WHICH DR BAUERSTEIN HAD GIVEN HIM TO ME SHOW MONSIEUR POIROT EVERYTHING HE WANTS TO SEE THE ROOMS ARE LOCKED ASKED POIROT DR BAUERSTEIN CONSIDERED IT ADVISABLE POIROT NODDED THOUGHTFULLY THEN HE IS VERY SURE WELL THAT SIMPLIFIES MATTERS FOR US WE WENT UP TOGETHER TO THE ROOM OF THE TRAGEDY FOR CONVENIENCE I APPEND A PLAN OF THE ROOM AND THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLES OF FURNITURE IN IT POIROT LOCKED THE DOOR ON THE INSIDE AND PROCEEDED TO A MINUTE INSPECTION OF THE ROOM HE DARTED FROM ONE OBJECT TO THE OTHER WITH THE AGILITY OF A GRASSHOPPER I REMAINED BY THE DOOR FEARING TO OBLITERATE ANY CLUES POIROT HOWEVER DID NOT SEEM GRATEFUL TO ME FOR MY FORBEARANCE WHAT HAVE YOU MY FRIEND HE CRIED THAT YOU REMAIN THERE LIKEHOW DO YOU SAY ITAH YES THE STUCK PIG I EXPLAINED THAT I WAS AFRAID OF OBLITERATING ANY FOOTMARKS FOOTMARKS BUT WHAT AN IDEA THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN PRACTICALLY AN ARMY IN THE ROOM WHAT FOOTMARKS ARE WE LIKELY TO FIND NO COME HERE AND AID ME IN MY SEARCH I WILL PUT DOWN MY LITTLE CASE UNTIL I NEED IT HE DID SO ON THE ROUND TABLE BY THE WINDOW BUT IT WAS AN ILLADVISED PROCEEDING FOR THE TOP OF IT BEING LOOSE IT TILTED UP AND PRECIPITATED THE DESPATCHCASE ON THE FLOOR EH VOIL UNE TABLE CRIED POIROT AH MY FRIEND ONE MAY LIVE IN A BIG HOUSE AND YET HAVE NO COMFORT AFTER WHICH PIECE OF MORALIZING HE RESUMED HIS SEARCH A SMALL PURPLE DESPATCHCASE WITH A KEY IN THE LOCK ON THE WRITINGTABLE ENGAGED HIS ATTENTION FOR SOME TIME HE TOOK OUT THE KEY FROM THE LOCK AND PASSED IT TO ME TO INSPECT I SAW NOTHING PECULIAR HOWEVER IT WAS AN ORDINARY KEY OF THE YALE TYPE WITH A BIT OF TWISTED WIRE THROUGH THE HANDLE NEXT HE EXAMINED THE FRAMEWORK OF THE DOOR WE HAD BROKEN IN ASSURING HIMSELF THAT THE BOLT HAD REALLY BEEN SHOT THEN HE WENT TO THE DOOR OPPOSITE LEADING INTO CYNTHIAS ROOM THAT DOOR WAS ALSO BOLTED AS I HAD STATED HOWEVER HE WENT TO THE LENGTH OF UNBOLTING IT AND OPENING AND SHUTTING IT SEVERAL TIMES THIS HE DID WITH THE UTMOST PRECAUTION AGAINST MAKING ANY NOISE SUDDENLY SOMETHING IN THE BOLT ITSELF SEEMED TO RIVET HIS ATTENTION HE EXAMINED IT CAREFULLY AND THEN NIMBLY WHIPPING OUT A PAIR OF SMALL FORCEPS FROM HIS CASE HE DREW OUT SOME MINUTE PARTICLE WHICH HE CAREFULLY SEALED UP IN A TINY ENVELOPE ON THE CHEST OF DRAWERS THERE WAS A TRAY WITH A SPIRIT LAMP AND A SMALL SAUCEPAN ON IT A SMALL QUANTITY OF A DARK FLUID REMAINED IN THE SAUCEPAN AND AN EMPTY CUP AND SAUCER THAT HAD BEEN DRUNK OUT OF STOOD NEAR IT I WONDERED HOW I COULD HAVE BEEN SO UNOBSERVANT AS TO OVERLOOK THIS HERE WAS A CLUE WORTH HAVING POIROT DELICATELY DIPPED HIS FINGER INTO LIQUID AND TASTED IT GINGERLY HE MADE A GRIMACE COCOAWITHI THINKRUM IN IT HE PASSED ON TO THE DEBRIS ON THE FLOOR WHERE THE TABLE BY THE BED HAD BEEN OVERTURNED A READINGLAMP SOME BOOKS MATCHES A BUNCH OF KEYS AND THE CRUSHED FRAGMENTS OF A COFFEECUP LAY SCATTERED ABOUT AH THIS IS CURIOUS SAID POIROT I MUST CONFESS THAT I SEE NOTHING PARTICULARLY CURIOUS ABOUT IT YOU DO NOT OBSERVE THE LAMPTHE CHIMNEY IS BROKEN IN TWO PLACES THEY LIE THERE AS THEY FELL BUT SEE THE COFFEECUP IS ABSOLUTELY SMASHED TO POWDER WELL I SAID WEARILY I SUPPOSE SOMEONE MUST HAVE STEPPED ON IT EXACTLY SAID POIROT IN AN ODD VOICE SOMEONE STEPPED ON IT HE ROSE FROM HIS KNEES AND WALKED SLOWLY ACROSS TO THE MANTELPIECE WHERE HE STOOD ABSTRACTEDLY FINGERING THE ORNAMENTS AND STRAIGHTENING THEMA TRICK OF HIS WHEN HE WAS AGITATED MON AMI HE SAID TURNING TO ME SOMEBODY STEPPED ON THAT CUP GRINDING IT TO POWDER AND THE REASON THEY DID SO WAS EITHER BECAUSE IT CONTAINED STRYCHNINE ORWHICH IS FAR MORE SERIOUSBECAUSE IT DID NOT CONTAIN STRYCHNINE I MADE NO REPLY I WAS BEWILDERED BUT I KNEW THAT IT WAS NO GOOD ASKING HIM TO EXPLAIN IN A MOMENT OR TWO HE ROUSED HIMSELF AND WENT ON WITH HIS INVESTIGATIONS HE PICKED UP THE BUNCH OF KEYS FROM THE FLOOR AND TWIRLING THEM ROUND IN HIS FINGERS FINALLY SELECTED ONE VERY BRIGHT AND SHINING WHICH HE TRIED IN THE LOCK OF THE PURPLE DESPATCHCASE IT FITTED AND HE OPENED THE BOX BUT AFTER A MOMENTS HESITATION CLOSED AND RELOCKED IT AND SLIPPED THE BUNCH OF KEYS AS WELL AS THE KEY THAT HAD ORIGINALLY STOOD IN THE LOCK INTO HIS OWN POCKET I HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO GO THROUGH THESE PAPERS BUT IT SHOULD BE DONEAT ONCE HE THEN MADE A VERY CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE DRAWERS OF THE WASHSTAND CROSSING THE ROOM TO THE LEFTHAND WINDOW A ROUND STAIN HARDLY VISIBLE ON THE DARK BROWN CARPET SEEMED TO INTEREST HIM PARTICULARLY HE WENT DOWN ON HIS KNEES EXAMINING IT MINUTELYEVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO SMELL IT FINALLY HE POURED A FEW DROPS OF THE COCOA INTO A TEST TUBE SEALING IT UP CAREFULLY HIS

NIGHTWHENEVER SHE FANCIED IT WHAT WAS IT PLAIN COCOA YES SIR MADE WITH MILK WITH A TEASPOONFUL OF SUGAR AND TWO TEASPOONFULS OF RUM IN IT WHO TOOK IT TO HER ROOM I DID SIR ALWAYS YES SIR AT WHAT TIME WHEN I WENT TO DRAW THE CURTAINS AS A RULE SIR DID YOU BRING IT STRAIGHT UP FROM THE KITCHEN THEN NO SIR YOU SEE THERES NOT MUCH ROOM ON THE GAS STOVE SO COOK USED TO MAKE IT EARLY BEFORE PUTTING THE VEGETABLES ON FOR SUPPER THEN I USED TO BRING IT UP AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE BY THE SWING DOOR AND TAKE IT INTO HER ROOM LATER THE SWING DOOR IS IN THE LEFT WING IS IT NOT YES SIR AND THE TABLE IS IT ON THIS SIDE OF THE DOOR OR ON THE FARTHERSERVANTS SIDE ITS THIS SIDE SIR WHAT TIME DID YOU BRING IT UP LAST NIGHT ABOUT QUARTERPAST SEVEN I SHOULD SAY SIR AND WHEN DID YOU TAKE IT INTO MRS

THINK THERE WAS SALT IN IT ASKED POIROT SEEING IT ON THE TRAY SIR YOU SAW SOME SALT ON THE TRAY YES COARSE KITCHEN SALT IT LOOKED I NEVER NOTICED IT WHEN I TOOK THE TRAY UP BUT WHEN I CAME TO TAKE IT INTO THE MISTRESSS ROOM I SAW IT AT ONCE AND I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN IT DOWN AGAIN AND ASKED COOK TO MAKE SOME FRESH BUT I WAS IN A HURRY BECAUSE DORCAS WAS OUT AND I THOUGHT MAYBE THE COCOA ITSELF WAS ALL RIGHT AND THE SALT HAD ONLY GONE ON THE TRAY SO I DUSTED IT OFF WITH MY APRON AND TOOK IT IN I HAD THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY IN CONTROLLING MY EXCITEMENT UNKNOWN TO HERSELF ANNIE HAD PROVIDED US WITH AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF EVIDENCE HOW SHE WOULD HAVE GAPED IF SHE HAD REALIZED THAT HER COARSE KITCHEN SALT WAS STRYCHNINE ONE OF THE MOST DEADLY POISONS KNOWN TO MANKIND I MARVELLED AT POIROTS CALM HIS SELFCONTROL WAS ASTONISHING I AWAITED HIS NEXT QUESTION WITH IMPATIENCE BUT IT DISAPPOINTED ME WHEN YOU WENT INTO MRS INGLETHORPS ROOM WAS THE DOOR LEADING INTO MISS CYNTHIAS ROOM BOLTED OH YES SIR IT ALWAYS WAS IT HAD NEVER BEEN OPENED AND THE DOOR INTO MR INGLETHORPS ROOM DID YOU NOTICE IF THAT WAS BOLTED TOO ANNIE HESITATED I COULDNT RIGHTLY SAY SIR IT WAS SHUT BUT I COULDNT SAY WHETHER IT WAS BOLTED OR NOT WHEN YOU FINALLY LEFT THE ROOM DID MRS INGLETHORP BOLT THE DOOR AFTER YOU NO SIR NOT THEN BUT I EXPECT SHE DID LATER SHE USUALLY DID LOCK IT AT NIGHT THE DOOR INTO THE PASSAGE THAT IS DID YOU NOTICE ANY CANDLE GREASE ON THE FLOOR WHEN YOU DID THE ROOM YESTERDAY CANDLE GREASE OH NO SIR MRS INGLETHORP DIDNT HAVE A CANDLE ONLY A READINGLAMP THEN IF THERE HAD BEEN A LARGE PATCH OF CANDLE GREASE ON THE FLOOR YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SURE TO HAVE SEEN IT YES SIR AND I WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT OUT WITH A PIECE OF BLOTTINGPAPER AND A HOT IRON THEN POIROT REPEATED THE QUESTION HE HAD PUT TO DORCAS DID YOUR MISTRESS EVER HAVE A GREEN DRESS NO SIR NOR A MANTLE NOR A CAPE NOR AHOW DO YOU CALL ITA SPORTS COAT NOT GREEN SIR NOR ANYONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE ANNIE REFLECTED

CRIED I CONGRATULATE YOU THIS IS A GREAT DISCOVERY WHAT IS A GREAT DISCOVERY WHY THAT IT WAS THE COCOA AND NOT THE COFFEE THAT WAS POISONED THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING OF COURSE IT DID NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THE EARLY MORNING SINCE THE COCOA WAS ONLY DRUNK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SO YOU THINK THAT THE COCOAMARK WELL WHAT I SAY HASTINGS THE COCOACONTAINED STRYCHNINE OF COURSE THAT SALT ON THE TRAY WHAT ELSE COULD IT HAVE BEEN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SALT REPLIED POIROT PLACIDLY I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS IF HE WAS GOING TO TAKE THE MATTER THAT WAY IT WAS NO GOOD ARGUING WITH HIM THE IDEA CROSSED MY MIND NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT POOR OLD POIROT WAS GROWING OLD PRIVATELY I THOUGHT IT LUCKY THAT HE HAD ASSOCIATED WITH HIM SOMEONE OF A MORE RECEPTIVE TYPE OF MIND POIROT WAS SURVEYING ME WITH QUIETLY TWINKLING EYES YOU ARE NOT PLEASED WITH ME MON AMI MY DEAR POIROT I SAID COLDLY IT IS NOT FOR ME TO DICTATE TO YOU YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO YOUR OWN OPINION JUST AS I HAVE TO MINE A MOST ADMIRABLE SENTIMENT REMARKED POIROT RISING BRISKLY TO HIS FEET NOW I HAVE FINISHED WITH THIS ROOM BY THE WAY WHOSE IS THE SMALLER DESK IN THE CORNER MR INGLETHORPS AH HE TRIED THE ROLL TOP TENTATIVELY LOCKED BUT PERHAPS ONE OF MRS INGLETHORPS KEYS WOULD OPEN IT HE TRIED SEVERAL TWISTING AND TURNING THEM WITH A PRACTICED HAND AND FINALLY UTTERING AN EJACULATION OF SATISFACTION VOIL IT IS NOT THE KEY BUT IT WILL OPEN IT AT A PINCH HE SLID BACK THE ROLL TOP AND RAN A RAPID EYE OVER THE NEATLY FILED PAPERS TO MY SURPRISE HE DID NOT EXAMINE THEM MERELY REMARKING APPROVINGLY AS HE RELOCKED THE DESK DECIDEDLY HE IS A MAN OF METHOD THIS MR INGLETHORP A MAN OF METHOD WAS IN POIROTS ESTIMATION THE HIGHEST PRAISE THAT COULD BE BESTOWED ON ANY INDIVIDUAL I FELT THAT MY FRIEND WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD BEEN AS HE RAMBLED ON DISCONNECTEDLY THERE WERE NO STAMPS IN HIS DESK BUT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN EH MON AMI THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN YESHIS EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOMTHIS BOUDOIR HAS NOTHING MORE TO TELL US IT DID NOT YIELD MUCH ONLY THIS HE PULLED A CRUMPLED ENVELOPE OUT OF HIS POCKET AND TOSSED IT OVER TO ME IT WAS RATHER A CURIOUS DOCUMENT A PLAIN DIRTY LOOKING OLD ENVELOPE WITH A FEW WORDS SCRAWLED ACROSS IT APPARENTLY AT RANDOM THE FOLLOWING IS A FACSIMILE OF IT CHAPTER V IT ISNT STRYCHNINE IS IT WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS I ASKED POIROT IN LIVELY CURIOSITY IN THE WASTEPAPER BASKET YOU RECOGNISE THE HANDWRITING YES IT IS MRS INGLETHORPS BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN POIROT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I CANNOT SAYBUT IT IS SUGGESTIVE A WILD IDEA FLASHED ACROSS ME WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT MRS INGLETHORPS MIND WAS DERANGED HAD SHE SOME FANTASTIC IDEA OF DEMONIACAL POSSESSION AND IF THAT WERE SO WAS IT NOT ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN HER OWN LIFE I WAS ABOUT TO EXPOUND THESE THEORIES TO POIROT WHEN HIS OWN WORDS DISTRACTED ME COME HE SAID NOW TO EXAMINE THE COFFEECUPS MY DEAR POIROT WHAT ON EARTH IS THE GOOD OF THAT NOW THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE COCOA OH L L THAT MISERABLE COCOA CRIED POIROT FLIPPANTLY HE LAUGHED WITH APPARENT ENJOYMENT RAISING HIS ARMS TO HEAVEN IN MOCK DESPAIR IN WHAT I COULD NOT BUT CONSIDER THE WORST POSSIBLE TASTE AND ANYWAY I SAID WITH INCREASING COLDNESS AS MRS INGLETHORP TOOK HER COFFEE UPSTAIRS WITH HER I DO NOT SEE WHAT YOU EXPECT TO FIND UNLESS YOU CONSIDER IT LIKELY THAT WE SHALL DISCOVER A PACKET OF STRYCHNINE ON THE COFFEE TRAY POIROT WAS SOBERED AT ONCE COME COME MY FRIEND HE SAID SLIPPING HIS ARMS THROUGH MINE NE VOUS FCHEZ PAS ALLOW ME TO INTEREST MYSELF IN MY COFFEECUPS AND I WILL RESPECT YOUR COCOA THERE IS IT A BARGAIN HE WAS SO QUAINTLY HUMOROUS THAT I WAS FORCED TO LAUGH AND WE WENT TOGETHER TO THE DRAWINGROOM WHERE THE COFFEECUPS AND TRAY REMAINED UNDISTURBED AS WE HAD LEFT THEM POIROT MADE ME RECAPITULATE THE SCENE OF THE NIGHT BEFORE LISTENING VERY CAREFULLY AND VERIFYING THE POSITION OF THE VARIOUS CUPS SO MRS CAVENDISH STOOD BY THE TRAYAND POURED OUT YES THEN SHE CAME ACROSS TO THE WINDOW WHERE YOU SAT WITH MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA YES HERE ARE THE THREE CUPS AND THE CUP ON THE MANTELPIECE HALF DRUNK THAT WOULD BE MR LAWRENCE CAVENDISHS AND THE ONE ON THE TRAY JOHN CAVENDISHS I SAW HIM PUT IT DOWN THERE GOOD ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVEBUT WHERE THEN IS THE CUP OF MR INGLETHORP HE DOES NOT TAKE COFFEE THEN ALL ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ONE MOMENT MY FRIEND WITH INFINITE CARE HE TOOK A DROP OR TWO FROM THE GROUNDS IN EACH CUP SEALING THEM UP IN SEPARATE TEST TUBES TASTING EACH IN TURN AS HE DID SO HIS PHYSIOGNOMY UNDERWENT A CURIOUS CHANGE AN EXPRESSION GATHERED THERE THAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS HALF PUZZLED AND HALF RELIEVED BIEN HE SAID AT LAST IT IS EVIDENT I HAD AN IDEABUT CLEARLY I WAS MISTAKEN YES ALTOGETHER I WAS MISTAKEN YET IT IS STRANGE BUT NO MATTER AND WITH A CHARACTERISTIC SHRUG HE DISMISSED WHATEVER IT WAS THAT WAS WORRYING HIM FROM HIS MIND I COULD HAVE TOLD HIM FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THIS OBSESSION OF HIS OVER THE COFFEE WAS BOUND TO END IN A BLIND ALLEY BUT I RESTRAINED MY TONGUE AFTER ALL THOUGH HE WAS OLD POIROT HAD BEEN A GREAT MAN IN HIS DAY BREAKFAST IS READY SAID JOHN CAVENDISH COMING IN FROM THE HALL YOU WILL BREAKFAST WITH US MONSIEUR POIROT POIROT ACQUIESCED I OBSERVED JOHN ALREADY HE WAS ALMOST RESTORED TO HIS NORMAL SELF THE SHOCK OF THE EVENTS OF THE LAST NIGHT HAD UPSET HIM TEMPORARILY BUT HIS EQUABLE POISE SOON SWUNG BACK TO THE NORMAL HE WAS A MAN OF VERY LITTLE IMAGINATION IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH HIS BROTHER WHO HAD PERHAPS TOO MUCH EVER SINCE THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING JOHN HAD BEEN HARD AT WORK SENDING TELEGRAMSONE OF THE FIRST HAD GONE TO EVELYN HOWARDWRITING NOTICES FOR THE PAPERS AND GENERALLY OCCUPYING HIMSELF WITH THE MELANCHOLY DUTIES THAT A DEATH ENTAILS MAY I ASK HOW THINGS ARE PROCEEDING HE SAID DO YOUR INVESTIGATIONS POINT TO MY MOTHER HAVING DIED A NATURAL DEATHOROR MUST WE PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THE WORST I THINK MR CAVENDISH SAID POIROT GRAVELY THAT YOU WOULD DO WELL NOT TO BUOY YOURSELF UP WITH ANY FALSE HOPES CAN YOU TELL ME THE VIEWS OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY MY BROTHER LAWRENCE IS CONVINCED THAT WE ARE MAKING A FUSS OVER NOTHING HE SAYS THAT EVERYTHING POINTS TO ITS BEING A SIMPLE CASE OF HEART FAILURE HE DOES DOES HE THAT IS VERY INTERESTINGVERY INTERESTING MURMURED POIROT SOFTLY AND MRS CAVENDISH A FAINT CLOUD PASSED OVER JOHNS FACE I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA WHAT MY WIFES VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT ARE THE ANSWER BROUGHT A MOMENTARY STIFFNESS IN ITS TRAIN JOHN BROKE THE RATHER AWKWARD SILENCE BY SAYING WITH A SLIGHT EFFORT I TOLD YOU DIDNT I THAT MR INGLETHORP HAS RETURNED POIROT BENT HIS HEAD ITS AN AWKWARD POSITION FOR ALL OF US OF COURSE ONE HAS TO TREAT HIM AS USUALBUT HANG IT ALL ONES GORGE DOES RISE AT SITTING DOWN TO EAT WITH A POSSIBLE MURDERER POIROT NODDED SYMPATHETICALLY I QUITE UNDERSTAND IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR YOU MR CAVENDISH I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION MR INGLETHORPS REASON FOR NOT RETURNING LAST NIGHT WAS I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE LATCHKEY IS NOT THAT SO YES I SUPPOSE YOU ARE QUITE SURE THAT THE LATCHKEY WAS FORGOTTENTHAT HE DID NOT TAKE IT AFTER ALL I HAVE NO IDEA I NEVER THOUGHT OF LOOKING WE ALWAYS KEEP IT IN THE HALL DRAWER ILL GO AND SEE IF ITS THERE NOW POIROT HELD UP HIS HAND WITH A FAINT SMILE NO NO MR CAVENDISH IT IS TOO LATE NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT YOU WOULD FIND IT IF MR INGLETHORP DID TAKE IT HE HAS HAD AMPLE TIME TO REPLACE IT BY NOW BUT DO YOU THINK I THINK NOTHING IF ANYONE HAD CHANCED TO LOOK THIS MORNING BEFORE HIS RETURN AND SEEN IT THERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VALUABLE POINT IN HIS FAVOUR THAT IS ALL JOHN LOOKED PERPLEXED DO NOT WORRY SAID POIROT SMOOTHLY I ASSURE YOU THAT YOU NEED NOT LET IT TROUBLE YOU SINCE YOU ARE SO KIND LET US GO AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST EVERYONE WAS ASSEMBLED IN THE DININGROOM UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE WERE NATURALLY NOT A CHEERFUL PARTY THE REACTION AFTER A SHOCK IS ALWAYS TRYING AND I THINK WE WERE ALL SUFFERING FROM IT DECORUM AND GOOD BREEDING NATURALLY ENJOINED THAT OUR DEMEANOUR SHOULD BE MUCH AS USUAL YET I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING IF THIS SELFCONTROL WERE REALLY A MATTER OF GREAT DIFFICULTY THERE WERE NO RED EYES NO SIGNS OF SECRETLY INDULGED GRIEF I FELT THAT I WAS RIGHT IN MY OPINION THAT DORCAS WAS THE PERSON MOST AFFECTED BY THE PERSONAL SIDE OF THE TRAGEDY I PASS OVER ALFRED INGLETHORP WHO ACTED THE BEREAVED WIDOWER IN A MANNER THAT I FELT TO BE DISGUSTING IN ITS HYPOCRISY DID HE KNOW THAT WE SUSPECTED HIM I WONDERED SURELY HE COULD NOT BE UNAWARE OF THE FACT CONCEAL IT AS WE WOULD DID HE FEEL SOME SECRET STIRRING OF FEAR OR WAS HE CONFIDENT THAT HIS CRIME WOULD GO UNPUNISHED SURELY THE SUSPICION IN THE ATMOSPHERE MUST WARN HIM THAT HE WAS ALREADY A MARKED MAN BUT DID EVERYONE SUSPECT HIM WHAT ABOUT MRS CAVENDISH I WATCHED HER AS SHE SAT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE GRACEFUL COMPOSED ENIGMATIC IN HER SOFT GREY FROCK WITH WHITE RUFFLES AT THE WRISTS FALLING OVER HER SLENDER HANDS SHE LOOKED VERY BEAUTIFUL WHEN SHE CHOSE HOWEVER HER FACE COULD BE SPHINXLIKE IN ITS INSCRUTABILITY SHE WAS VERY SILENT HARDLY OPENING HER LIPS AND YET IN SOME QUEER WAY I FELT THAT THE GREAT STRENGTH OF HER PERSONALITY WAS DOMINATING US ALL AND LITTLE CYNTHIA DID SHE SUSPECT SHE LOOKED VERY TIRED AND ILL I THOUGHT THE HEAVINESS AND LANGUOR OF HER MANNER WERE VERY MARKED I ASKED HER IF SHE WERE FEELING ILL AND SHE ANSWERED FRANKLY YES IVE GOT THE MOST BEASTLY HEADACHE HAVE ANOTHER CUP OF COFFEE MADEMOISELLE SAID POIROT SOLICITOUSLY IT WILL REVIVE YOU IT IS UNPARALLELED FOR THE MAL DE TTE HE JUMPED UP AND TOOK HER CUP NO SUGAR SAID CYNTHIA WATCHING HIM AS HE PICKED UP THE SUGARTONGS NO SUGAR YOU ABANDON IT IN THE WARTIME EH NO I NEVER TAKE IT IN COFFEE SACR MURMURED POIROT TO HIMSELF AS HE BROUGHT BACK THE REPLENISHED CUP ONLY I HEARD HIM AND GLANCING UP CURIOUSLY AT THE LITTLE MAN I SAW THAT HIS FACE WAS WORKING WITH SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT AND HIS EYES WERE AS GREEN AS A CATS HE HAD HEARD OR SEEN SOMETHING THAT HAD AFFECTED HIM STRONGLYBUT WHAT WAS IT I DO NOT USUALLY LABEL MYSELF AS DENSE BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY HAD ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED AND DORCAS APPEARED MR WELLS TO SEE YOU SIR SHE SAID TO JOHN I REMEMBERED THE NAME AS BEING THAT OF THE LAWYER TO WHOM MRS INGLETHORP HAD WRITTEN THE NIGHT BEFORE JOHN ROSE IMMEDIATELY SHOW HIM INTO MY STUDY THEN HE TURNED TO US MY MOTHERS LAWYER HE EXPLAINED AND IN A LOWER VOICE HE IS ALSO CORONERYOU UNDERSTAND PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO COME WITH ME WE ACQUIESCED AND FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM JOHN STRODE ON AHEAD AND I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF WHISPERING TO POIROT THERE WILL BE AN INQUEST THEN POIROT NODDED ABSENTLY HE SEEMED ABSORBED IN THOUGHT SO MUCH SO THAT MY CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED WHAT IS IT YOU ARE NOT ATTENDING TO WHAT I SAY IT IS TRUE MY FRIEND I AM MUCH WORRIED WHY BECAUSE MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA DOES NOT TAKE SUGAR IN HER COFFEE WHAT YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS BUT I AM MOST SERIOUS AH THERE IS SOMETHING THERE THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MY INSTINCT WAS RIGHT WHAT INSTINCT THE INSTINCT THAT LED ME TO INSIST ON EXAMINING THOSE COFFEECUPS CHUT NO MORE NOW WE FOLLOWED JOHN INTO HIS STUDY AND HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND US MR WELLS WAS A PLEASANT MAN OF MIDDLEAGE WITH KEEN EYES AND THE TYPICAL LAWYERS MOUTH JOHN INTRODUCED US BOTH AND EXPLAINED THE REASON OF OUR PRESENCE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WELLS HE ADDED THAT THIS IS ALL STRICTLY PRIVATE WE ARE STILL HOPING THAT THERE WILL TURN OUT TO BE NO NEED FOR INVESTIGATION OF ANY KIND QUITE SO QUITE SO SAID MR WELLS SOOTHINGLY I WISH WE COULD HAVE SPARED YOU THE PAIN AND PUBLICITY OF AN INQUEST BUT OF COURSE ITS QUITE UNAVOIDABLE IN THE ABSENCE OF A DOCTORS CERTIFICATE YES I SUPPOSE SO CLEVER MAN BAUERSTEIN GREAT AUTHORITY ON TOXICOLOGY I BELIEVE INDEED SAID JOHN WITH A CERTAIN STIFFNESS IN HIS MANNER THEN HE ADDED RATHER HESITATINGLY SHALL WE HAVE TO APPEAR AS WITNESSESALL OF US I MEAN YOU OF COURSEAND AHERMRERINGLETHORP A SLIGHT PAUSE ENSUED BEFORE THE LAWYER WENT ON IN HIS SOOTHING MANNER ANY OTHER EVIDENCE WILL BE SIMPLY CONFIRMATORY A MERE MATTER OF FORM I SEE A FAINT EXPRESSION OF RELIEF SWEPT OVER JOHNS FACE IT PUZZLED ME FOR I SAW NO OCCASION FOR IT IF YOU KNOW OF NOTHING TO THE CONTRARY PURSUED MR WELLS I HAD THOUGHT OF FRIDAY THAT WILL GIVE US PLENTY OF TIME FOR THE DOCTORS REPORT THE POSTMORTEM IS TO TAKE PLACE TONIGHT I BELIEVE YES THEN THAT ARRANGEMENT WILL SUIT YOU PERFECTLY I NEED NOT TELL YOU MY DEAR CAVENDISH HOW DISTRESSED I AM AT THIS MOST TRAGIC AFFAIR CAN YOU GIVE US NO HELP IN SOLVING IT MONSIEUR INTERPOSED POIROT SPEAKING FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WE HAD ENTERED THE ROOM I YES WE HEARD THAT MRS INGLETHORP WROTE TO YOU LAST NIGHT YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED THE LETTER THIS MORNING I DID BUT IT CONTAINS NO INFORMATION IT IS MERELY A NOTE ASKING ME TO CALL UPON HER THIS MORNING AS SHE WANTED MY ADVICE ON A MATTER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE SHE GAVE YOU NO HINT AS TO WHAT THAT MATTER MIGHT BE UNFORTUNATELY NO THAT IS A PITY SAID JOHN A GREAT PITY AGREED POIROT GRAVELY THERE WAS SILENCE POIROT REMAINED LOST IN THOUGHT FOR A FEW MINUTES FINALLY HE TURNED TO THE LAWYER AGAIN MR WELLS THERE IS ONE THING I SHOULD LIKE TO ASK YOUTHAT IS IF IT IS NOT AGAINST PROFESSIONAL ETIQUETTE IN THE EVENT OF MRS INGLETHORPS DEATH WHO WOULD INHERIT HER MONEY THE LAWYER HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN REPLIED THE KNOWLEDGE WILL BE PUBLIC PROPERTY VERY SOON SO IF MR CAVENDISH DOES NOT OBJECT NOT AT ALL INTERPOLATED JOHN I DO NOT SEE ANY REASON WHY I SHOULD NOT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BY HER LAST WILL DATED AUGUST OF LAST

THEATRE TICKET SHE DIDNT UNDERSTANDWAS VERY OFFENDED SOMETIMES SAID I WAS FOOLISHLY PROUD IT WASNT THATBUT I COULDNT EXPLAIN ANYWAY I KEPT MY SELFRESPECT AND SO OUT OF THE WHOLE BUNCH I WAS THE ONLY

NODDED SYMPATHETICALLY I UNDERSTAND MADEMOISELLE I UNDERSTAND ALL YOU FEEL IT IS MOST NATURAL YOU THINK THAT WE ARE LUKEWARMTHAT WE LACK FIRE AND ENERGYBUT TRUST ME IT IS NOT SO JOHN STUCK HIS HEAD IN AT THIS JUNCTURE AND INVITED US BOTH TO COME UP TO MRS INGLETHORPS ROOM AS HE AND MR WELLS HAD FINISHED LOOKING THROUGH THE DESK IN THE BOUDOIR AS WE WENT UP THE STAIRS JOHN LOOKED BACK TO THE DININGROOM DOOR AND LOWERED HIS VOICE CONFIDENTIALLY LOOK HERE WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THESE TWO MEET I SHOOK MY HEAD HELPLESSLY IVE TOLD MARY TO KEEP THEM APART IF SHE CAN WILL SHE BE ABLE TO DO SO THE LORD ONLY KNOWS THERES ONE THING INGLETHORP HIMSELF WONT BE TOO KEEN ON MEETING HER YOUVE GOT THE KEYS STILL HAVENT YOU POIROT I ASKED AS WE REACHED THE DOOR OF THE LOCKED ROOM TAKING THE KEYS FROM POIROT JOHN UNLOCKED IT AND WE ALL PASSED IN THE LAWYER WENT STRAIGHT TO THE DESK AND JOHN FOLLOWED HIM MY MOTHER KEPT MOST OF HER IMPORTANT PAPERS IN THIS DESPATCHCASE I BELIEVE HE SAID POIROT DREW OUT THE SMALL BUNCH OF KEYS PERMIT ME I LOCKED IT OUT OF PRECAUTION THIS MORNING BUT ITS NOT LOCKED NOW IMPOSSIBLE SEE AND JOHN LIFTED THE LID AS HE SPOKE MILLES TONNERRES CRIED POIROT DUMBFOUNDED AND IWHO HAVE BOTH THE KEYS IN MY POCKET HE FLUNG HIMSELF UPON THE CASE SUDDENLY HE STIFFENED EH VOIL UNE AFFAIRE THIS LOCK HAS BEEN FORCED WHAT POIROT LAID DOWN THE CASE AGAIN BUT WHO FORCED IT WHY SHOULD THEY WHEN BUT THE DOOR WAS LOCKED THESE EXCLAMATIONS BURST FROM US DISJOINTEDLY POIROT ANSWERED THEM CATEGORICALLYALMOST MECHANICALLY WHO THAT IS THE QUESTION WHY AH IF I ONLY KNEW WHEN SINCE I WAS HERE AN HOUR AGO AS TO THE DOOR BEING LOCKED IT IS A VERY ORDINARY LOCK PROBABLY ANY OTHER OF THE DOORKEYS IN THIS PASSAGE WOULD FIT IT WE STARED AT ONE ANOTHER BLANKLY POIROT HAD WALKED OVER TO THE MANTELPIECE HE WAS OUTWARDLY CALM BUT I NOTICED HIS HANDS WHICH FROM LONG FORCE OF HABIT WERE MECHANICALLY STRAIGHTENING THE SPILL VASES ON THE MANTELPIECE WERE SHAKING VIOLENTLY SEE HERE IT WAS LIKE THIS HE SAID AT LAST THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THAT CASESOME PIECE OF EVIDENCE SLIGHT IN ITSELF PERHAPS BUT STILL ENOUGH OF A CLUE TO CONNECT THE MURDERER WITH THE CRIME IT WAS VITAL TO HIM THAT IT SHOULD BE DESTROYED BEFORE IT WAS DISCOVERED AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE APPRECIATED THEREFORE HE TOOK THE RISK THE GREAT RISK OF COMING IN HERE FINDING THE CASE LOCKED HE WAS OBLIGED TO FORCE IT THUS BETRAYING HIS PRESENCE FOR HIM TO TAKE THAT RISK IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING OF GREAT IMPORTANCE BUT WHAT WAS IT AH CRIED POIROT WITH A GESTURE OF ANGER THAT I DO NOT KNOW A DOCUMENT OF SOME KIND WITHOUT DOUBT POSSIBLY THE SCRAP OF PAPER DORCAS SAW IN HER HAND YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND I HIS ANGER BURST FORTH FREELYMISERABLE ANIMAL THAT I AM I GUESSED NOTHING I HAVE BEHAVED LIKE AN IMBECILE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT THAT CASE HERE I SHOULD HAVE CARRIED IT AWAY WITH ME AH TRIPLE PIG AND NOW IT IS GONE IT IS DESTROYEDBUT IS IT DESTROYED IS THERE NOT YET A CHANCEWE MUST LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED HE RUSHED LIKE A MADMAN FROM THE ROOM AND I FOLLOWED HIM AS SOON AS I HAD SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED MY WITS BUT BY THE TIME I HAD REACHED THE TOP OF THE STAIRS HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT MARY CAVENDISH WAS STANDING WHERE THE STAIRCASE BRANCHED STARING DOWN INTO THE HALL IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH HE HAD DISAPPEARED WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOUR EXTRAORDINARY LITTLE FRIEND MR HASTINGS HE HAS JUST RUSHED PAST ME LIKE A MAD BULL HES RATHER UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING I REMARKED FEEBLY I REALLY DID NOT KNOW HOW MUCH POIROT WOULD WISH ME TO DISCLOSE AS I SAW A FAINT SMILE GATHER ON MRS CAVENDISHS EXPRESSIVE MOUTH I ENDEAVOURED TO TRY AND TURN THE CONVERSATION BY SAYING THEY HAVENT MET YET HAVE THEY WHO MR INGLETHORP AND MISS HOWARD SHE LOOKED AT ME IN RATHER A DISCONCERTING MANNER DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE SUCH A DISASTER IF THEY DID MEET WELL DONT YOU I SAID RATHER TAKEN ABACK NO SHE WAS SMILING IN HER QUIET WAY I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE A GOOD FLARE UP IT WOULD CLEAR THE AIR AT PRESENT WE ARE ALL THINKING SO MUCH AND SAYING SO LITTLE JOHN DOESNT THINK SO I REMARKED HES ANXIOUS TO KEEP THEM APART OH JOHN SOMETHING IN HER TONE FIRED ME AND I BLURTED OUT OLD JOHNS AN AWFULLY GOOD SORT SHE STUDIED ME CURIOUSLY FOR A MINUTE OR TWO AND THEN SAID TO MY GREAT SURPRISE YOU ARE LOYAL TO YOUR FRIEND I LIKE YOU FOR THAT ARENT YOU MY FRIEND TOO I AM A VERY BAD FRIEND WHY DO YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE IT IS TRUE I AM CHARMING TO MY FRIENDS ONE DAY AND FORGET ALL ABOUT THEM THE NEXT I DONT KNOW WHAT IMPELLED ME BUT I WAS NETTLED AND I SAID FOOLISHLY AND NOT IN THE BEST OF TASTE YET YOU SEEM TO BE INVARIABLY CHARMING TO DR BAUERSTEIN INSTANTLY I REGRETTED MY WORDS HER FACE STIFFENED I HAD THE IMPRESSION OF A STEEL CURTAIN COMING DOWN AND BLOTTING OUT THE REAL WOMAN WITHOUT A WORD SHE TURNED AND WENT SWIFTLY UP THE STAIRS WHILST I STOOD LIKE AN IDIOT GAPING AFTER HER I WAS RECALLED TO OTHER MATTERS BY A FRIGHTFUL ROW GOING ON BELOW I COULD HEAR POIROT SHOUTING AND EXPOUNDING I WAS VEXED TO THINK THAT MY DIPLOMACY HAD BEEN IN VAIN THE LITTLE MAN APPEARED TO BE TAKING THE WHOLE HOUSE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE A PROCEEDING OF WHICH I FOR ONE DOUBTED THE WISDOM ONCE AGAIN I COULD NOT HELP REGRETTING THAT MY FRIEND WAS SO PRONE TO LOSE HIS HEAD IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT I STEPPED BRISKLY DOWN THE STAIRS THE SIGHT OF ME CALMED POIROT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY I DREW HIM ASIDE MY DEAR FELLOW I SAID IS THIS WISE SURELY YOU DONT WANT THE WHOLE HOUSE TO KNOW OF THIS OCCURRENCE YOU ARE ACTUALLY PLAYING INTO THE CRIMINALS HANDS YOU THINK SO HASTINGS I AM SURE OF IT WELL WELL MY FRIEND I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOU GOOD ALTHOUGH UNFORTUNATELY IT IS A LITTLE TOO LATE NOW SURE HE LOOKED SO CRESTFALLEN AND ABASHED THAT I FELT QUITE SORRY THOUGH I STILL THOUGHT MY REBUKE A JUST AND WISE ONE WELL HE SAID AT LAST LET US GO MON AMI YOU HAVE FINISHED HERE FOR THE MOMENT YES YOU WILL WALK BACK WITH ME TO THE VILLAGE WILLINGLY HE PICKED UP HIS LITTLE SUITCASE AND WE WENT OUT THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW IN THE DRAWINGROOM CYNTHIA MURDOCH WAS JUST COMING IN AND POIROT STOOD ASIDE TO LET HER PASS EXCUSE ME MADEMOISELLE ONE MINUTE YES SHE TURNED INQUIRINGLY DID YOU EVER MAKE UP MRS INGLETHORPS MEDICINES A SLIGHT FLUSH ROSE IN HER FACE AS SHE ANSWERED RATHER CONSTRAINEDLY NO ONLY HER POWDERS THE FLUSH DEEPENED AS CYNTHIA REPLIED OH YES I DID MAKE UP SOME SLEEPING POWDERS FOR HER ONCE THESE POIROT PRODUCED THE EMPTY BOX WHICH HAD CONTAINED POWDERS SHE NODDED CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THEY WERE SULPHONAL VERONAL NO THEY WERE BROMIDE POWDERS AH THANK YOU MADEMOISELLE GOOD MORNING AS WE WALKED BRISKLY AWAY FROM THE HOUSE I GLANCED AT HIM MORE THAN ONCE I HAD OFTEN BEFORE NOTICED THAT IF ANYTHING EXCITED HIM HIS EYES TURNED GREEN LIKE A CATS THEY WERE SHINING LIKE EMERALDS NOW MY FRIEND HE BROKE OUT AT LAST I HAVE A LITTLE IDEA A VERY STRANGE AND PROBABLY UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE IDEA AND YETIT FITS IN I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS I PRIVATELY THOUGHT THAT POIROT WAS RATHER TOO MUCH GIVEN TO THESE FANTASTIC IDEAS IN THIS CASE SURELY THE TRUTH WAS ONLY TOO PLAIN AND APPARENT SO THAT IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE BLANK LABEL ON THE BOX I REMARKED VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SAID I REALLY WONDER THAT I DID NOT THINK OF IT MYSELF POIROT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE LISTENING TO ME THEY HAVE MADE ONE MORE DISCOVERY LBAS HE OBSERVED JERKING HIS THUMB OVER HIS SHOULDER IN THE DIRECTION OF STYLES MR WELLS TOLD ME AS WE WERE GOING UPSTAIRS WHAT WAS IT LOCKED UP IN THE DESK IN THE BOUDOIR THEY FOUND A WILL OF MRS INGLETHORPS DATED BEFORE HER MARRIAGE LEAVING HER FORTUNE TO ALFRED INGLETHORP IT MUST HAVE BEEN MADE JUST AT THE TIME THEY WERE ENGAGED IT CAME QUITE AS A SURPRISE TO WELLSAND TO JOHN CAVENDISH ALSO IT WAS WRITTEN ON ONE OF THOSE PRINTED WILL FORMS AND WITNESSED BY TWO OF THE SERVANTSNOT DORCAS DID MR INGLETHORP KNOW OF IT HE SAYS NOT ONE MIGHT TAKE THAT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT I REMARKED SCEPTICALLY ALL THESE WILLS ARE VERY CONFUSING TELL ME HOW DID THOSE SCRIBBLED WORDS ON THE ENVELOPE HELP YOU TO DISCOVER THAT A WILL WAS MADE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON POIROT SMILED MON AMI HAVE YOU EVER WHEN WRITING A LETTER BEEN ARRESTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SPELL A CERTAIN WORD YES OFTEN I SUPPOSE EVERYONE HAS EXACTLY AND HAVE YOU NOT IN SUCH A CASE TRIED THE WORD ONCE OR TWICE ON THE EDGE OF THE BLOTTINGPAPER OR A SPARE SCRAP OF PAPER TO SEE IF IT LOOKED RIGHT WELL THAT IS WHAT MRS INGLETHORP DID YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE WORD POSSESSED IS SPELT FIRST WITH ONE S AND SUBSEQUENTLY WITH TWOCORRECTLY TO MAKE SURE SHE HAD FURTHER TRIED IT IN A SENTENCE THUS I AM POSSESSED NOW WHAT DID THAT TELL ME IT TOLD ME THAT MRS INGLETHORP HAD BEEN WRITING THE WORD POSSESSED THAT AFTERNOON AND HAVING THE FRAGMENT OF PAPER FOUND IN THE GRATE FRESH IN MY MIND THE POSSIBILITY OF A WILLA DOCUMENT ALMOST CERTAIN TO CONTAIN THAT WORDOCCURRED TO ME AT ONCE THIS POSSIBILITY WAS CONFIRMED BY A FURTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE GENERAL CONFUSION THE BOUDOIR HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT THAT MORNING AND NEAR THE DESK WERE SEVERAL TRACES OF BROWN MOULD AND EARTH THE WEATHER HAD BEEN PERFECTLY FINE FOR SOME DAYS AND NO ORDINARY BOOTS WOULD HAVE LEFT SUCH A HEAVY DEPOSIT I STROLLED TO THE WINDOW AND SAW AT ONCE THAT THE BEGONIA BEDS HAD BEEN NEWLY PLANTED THE MOULD IN THE BEDS WAS EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THAT ON THE FLOOR OF THE BOUDOIR AND ALSO I LEARNT FROM YOU THAT THEY HAD BEEN PLANTED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON I WAS NOW SURE THAT ONE OR POSSIBLY BOTH OF THE GARDENERSFOR THERE WERE TWO SETS OF FOOTPRINTS IN THE BEDHAD ENTERED THE BOUDOIR FOR IF MRS INGLETHORP HAD MERELY WISHED TO SPEAK TO THEM SHE WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE STOOD AT THE WINDOW AND THEY WOULD NOT HAVE COME INTO THE ROOM AT ALL I WAS NOW QUITE CONVINCED THAT SHE HAD MADE A FRESH WILL AND HAD CALLED THE TWO GARDENERS IN TO WITNESS HER SIGNATURE EVENTS PROVED THAT I WAS RIGHT IN MY SUPPOSITION THAT WAS VERY INGENIOUS I COULD NOT HELP ADMITTING I MUST CONFESS THAT THE CONCLUSIONS I DREW FROM THOSE FEW SCRIBBLED WORDS WERE QUITE ERRONEOUS HE SMILED YOU GAVE TOO MUCH REIN TO YOUR IMAGINATION IMAGINATION IS A GOOD SERVANT AND A BAD MASTER THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION IS ALWAYS THE MOST LIKELY ANOTHER POINTHOW DID YOU KNOW THAT THE KEY OF THE DESPATCHCASE HAD BEEN LOST I DID NOT KNOW IT IT WAS A GUESS THAT TURNED OUT TO BE CORRECT YOU OBSERVED THAT IT HAD A PIECE OF TWISTED WIRE THROUGH THE HANDLE THAT SUGGESTED TO ME AT ONCE THAT IT HAD POSSIBLY BEEN WRENCHED OFF A FLIMSY KEYRING NOW IF IT HAD BEEN LOST AND RECOVERED MRS INGLETHORP WOULD AT ONCE HAVE REPLACED IT ON HER BUNCH BUT ON HER BUNCH I FOUND WHAT WAS OBVIOUSLY THE DUPLICATE KEY VERY NEW AND BRIGHT WHICH LED ME TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAD INSERTED THE ORIGINAL KEY IN THE LOCK OF THE DESPATCHCASE YES I SAID ALFRED INGLETHORP WITHOUT DOUBT POIROT LOOKED AT ME CURIOUSLY YOU ARE VERY SURE OF HIS GUILT WELL NATURALLY EVERY FRESH CIRCUMSTANCE SEEMS TO ESTABLISH IT MORE CLEARLY ON THE CONTRARY SAID POIROT QUIETLY THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS IN HIS FAVOUR OH COME NOW YES I SEE ONLY ONE AND THAT THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT BAD SHOT AS YOU ENGLISH SAY YOU HAVE CHOSEN THE ONE POINT THAT TO MY MIND TELLS AGAINST HIM HOW IS THAT BECAUSE IF MR INGLETHORP KNEW THAT HIS WIFE WOULD BE POISONED LAST NIGHT HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE ARRANGED TO BE AWAY FROM THE HOUSE HIS EXCUSE WAS AN OBVIOUSLY TRUMPED UP ONE THAT LEAVES US TWO POSSIBILITIES EITHER HE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN OR HE HAD A REASON OF HIS OWN FOR HIS ABSENCE AND THAT REASON I ASKED SCEPTICALLY POIROT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HOW SHOULD I KNOW DISCREDITABLE WITHOUT DOUBT THIS MR INGLETHORP I SHOULD SAY IS SOMEWHAT OF A SCOUNDRELBUT THAT DOES NOT OF NECESSITY MAKE HIM A MURDERER I SHOOK MY HEAD UNCONVINCED WE DO NOT AGREE EH SAID POIROT WELL LET US LEAVE IT TIME WILL SHOW WHICH OF US IS RIGHT NOW LET US TURN TO OTHER ASPECTS OF THE CASE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT ALL THE DOORS OF THE BEDROOM WERE BOLTED ON THE INSIDE WELL I CONSIDERED ONE MUST LOOK AT IT LOGICALLY TRUE I SHOULD PUT IT THIS WAY THE DOORS WERE BOLTEDOUR OWN EYES HAVE TOLD US THATYET THE PRESENCE OF THE CANDLE GREASE ON THE FLOOR AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WILL PROVE THAT DURING THE NIGHT SOMEONE ENTERED THE ROOM YOU AGREE SO FAR PERFECTLY PUT WITH ADMIRABLE CLEARNESS PROCEED WELL I SAID ENCOURAGED AS THE PERSON WHO ENTERED DID NOT DO SO BY THE WINDOW NOR BY MIRACULOUS MEANS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE DOOR MUST HAVE BEEN OPENED FROM INSIDE BY MRS INGLETHORP HERSELF THAT STRENGTHENS THE CONVICTION THAT THE PERSON IN QUESTION WAS HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD NATURALLY OPEN THE DOOR TO HER OWN HUSBAND POIROT SHOOK HIS HEAD WHY SHOULD SHE SHE HAD BOLTED THE DOOR LEADING INTO HIS ROOMA MOST UNUSUAL PROCEEDING ON HER PARTSHE HAD HAD A MOST VIOLENT QUARREL WITH HIM THAT VERY AFTERNOON NO HE WAS THE LAST PERSON SHE WOULD ADMIT BUT YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT THE DOOR MUST HAVE BEEN OPENED BY MRS INGLETHORP HERSELF THERE IS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY SHE MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN TO BOLT THE DOOR INTO THE PASSAGE WHEN SHE WENT TO BED AND HAVE GOT UP LATER TOWARDS MORNING AND BOLTED IT THEN POIROT IS THAT SERIOUSLY YOUR OPINION NO I DO NOT SAY IT IS SO BUT IT MIGHT BE NOW TO TURN TO ANOTHER FEATURE WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE SCRAP OF CONVERSATION YOU OVERHEARD BETWEEN MRS CAVENDISH AND HER MOTHERINLAW I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT I SAID THOUGHTFULLY THAT IS AS ENIGMATICAL AS EVER IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE THAT A WOMAN LIKE MRS CAVENDISH PROUD AND RETICENT TO THE LAST DEGREE SHOULD INTERFERE SO VIOLENTLY IN WHAT WAS CERTAINLY NOT HER AFFAIR PRECISELY IT WAS AN ASTONISHING THING FOR A WOMAN OF HER BREEDING TO DO IT IS CERTAINLY CURIOUS I AGREED STILL IT IS UNIMPORTANT AND NEED NOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT A GROAN BURST FROM POIROT WHAT HAVE I ALWAYS TOLD YOU EVERYTHING MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IF THE FACT WILL NOT FIT THE THEORYLET THE THEORY GO WELL WE SHALL SEE I SAID NETTLED YES WE SHALL SEE WE HAD REACHED LEASTWAYS COTTAGE AND POIROT USHERED ME UPSTAIRS TO HIS OWN ROOM HE OFFERED ME ONE OF THE TINY RUSSIAN CIGARETTES HE HIMSELF OCCASIONALLY SMOKED I WAS AMUSED TO NOTICE THAT HE STOWED AWAY THE USED MATCHES MOST CAREFULLY IN A LITTLE CHINA POT MY MOMENTARY ANNOYANCE VANISHED POIROT HAD PLACED OUR TWO CHAIRS IN FRONT OF THE OPEN WINDOW WHICH COMMANDED A VIEW OF THE VILLAGE STREET THE FRESH AIR BLEW IN WARM AND PLEASANT IT WAS GOING TO BE A HOT DAY SUDDENLY MY ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY A WEEDY LOOKING YOUNG MAN RUSHING DOWN THE STREET AT A GREAT PACE IT WAS THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARYA CURIOUS MINGLING OF TERROR AND AGITATION LOOK POIROT I SAID HE LEANT FORWARD TIENS HE SAID IT IS MR MACE FROM THE CHEMISTS SHOP HE IS COMING HERE THE YOUNG MAN CAME TO A HALT BEFORE LEASTWAYS COTTAGE AND AFTER HESITATING A MOMENT POUNDED VIGOROUSLY AT THE DOOR A LITTLE MINUTE CRIED POIROT FROM THE WINDOW I COME MOTIONING TO ME TO FOLLOW HIM HE RAN SWIFTLY DOWN THE STAIRS AND OPENED THE DOOR MR MACE BEGAN AT ONCE OH MR POIROT IM SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE BUT I HEARD THAT YOUD JUST COME BACK FROM THE HALL YES WE HAVE THE YOUNG MAN MOISTENED HIS DRY LIPS HIS FACE WAS WORKING CURIOUSLY ITS ALL OVER THE VILLAGE ABOUT OLD MRS INGLETHORP DYING SO SUDDENLY THEY DO SAY HE LOWERED HIS VOICE CAUTIOUSLYTHAT ITS POISON POIROTS FACE REMAINED QUITE IMPASSIVE ONLY THE DOCTORS CAN TELL US THAT MR MACE YES EXACTLYOF COURSE THE YOUNG MAN HESITATED AND THEN HIS AGITATION WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM HE CLUTCHED POIROT BY THE ARM AND SANK HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER JUST TELL ME THIS MR POIROT IT ISNTIT ISNT STRYCHNINE IS IT I HARDLY HEARD WHAT POIROT REPLIED SOMETHING EVIDENTLY OF A NONCOMMITTAL NATURE THE YOUNG MAN DEPARTED AND AS HE CLOSED THE DOOR POIROTS EYES MET MINE YES HE SAID NODDING GRAVELY HE WILL HAVE EVIDENCE TO GIVE AT THE INQUEST WE WENT SLOWLY UPSTAIRS AGAIN I WAS OPENING MY LIPS WHEN POIROT STOPPED ME WITH A GESTURE OF HIS HAND NOT NOW NOT NOW MON AMI I HAVE NEED OF REFLECTION MY MIND IS IN SOME DISORDERWHICH IS NOT WELL FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES HE SAT IN DEAD SILENCE PERFECTLY STILL EXCEPT FOR SEVERAL EXPRESSIVE MOTIONS OF HIS EYEBROWS AND ALL THE TIME HIS EYES GREW STEADILY GREENER AT LAST HE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH IT IS WELL THE BAD MOMENT HAS PASSED NOW ALL IS ARRANGED AND CLASSIFIED ONE MUST NEVER PERMIT CONFUSION THE CASE IS NOT CLEAR YETNO FOR IT IS OF THE MOST COMPLICATED IT PUZZLES ME ME HERCULE POIROT THERE ARE TWO FACTS OF SIGNIFICANCE AND WHAT ARE THEY THE FIRST IS THE STATE OF THE WEATHER YESTERDAY THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT IT WAS A GLORIOUS DAY I INTERRUPTED POIROT YOURE PULLING MY LEG NOT AT ALL THE THERMOMETER REGISTERED DEGREES IN THE SHADE DO NOT FORGET THAT MY FRIEND IT IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE RIDDLE AND THE SECOND POINT I ASKED THE IMPORTANT FACT THAT MONSIEUR INGLETHORP WEARS VERY PECULIAR CLOTHES HAS A BLACK BEARD AND USES GLASSES POIROT I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU ARE SERIOUS I AM ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS MY FRIEND BUT THIS IS CHILDISH NO IT IS VERY MOMENTOUS AND SUPPOSING THE CORONERS JURY RETURNS A VERDICT OF WILFUL MURDER AGAINST ALFRED INGLETHORP WHAT BECOMES OF YOUR THEORIES THEN THEY WOULD NOT BE SHAKEN BECAUSE TWELVE STUPID MEN HAD HAPPENED TO MAKE A MISTAKE BUT THAT WILL NOT OCCUR FOR ONE THING A COUNTRY JURY IS NOT ANXIOUS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY UPON ITSELF AND MR INGLETHORP STANDS PRACTICALLY IN THE POSITION OF LOCAL SQUIRE ALSO HE ADDED PLACIDLY I SHOULD NOT ALLOW IT YOU WOULD NOT ALLOW IT NO I LOOKED AT THE EXTRAORDINARY LITTLE MAN DIVIDED BETWEEN ANNOYANCE AND AMUSEMENT HE WAS SO TREMENDOUSLY SURE OF HIMSELF AS THOUGH HE READ MY THOUGHTS HE NODDED GENTLY OH YES MON AMI I WOULD DO WHAT I SAY HE GOT UP AND LAID HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER HIS PHYSIOGNOMY UNDERWENT A COMPLETE CHANGE TEARS CAME INTO HIS EYES IN ALL THIS YOU SEE I THINK OF THAT POOR MRS INGLETHORP WHO IS DEAD SHE WAS NOT EXTRAVAGANTLY LOVEDNO BUT SHE WAS VERY GOOD TO US BELGIANSI OWE HER A DEBT I ENDEAVOURED TO INTERRUPT BUT POIROT SWEPT ON LET ME TELL YOU THIS HASTINGS SHE WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME IF I LET ALFRED INGLETHORP HER HUSBAND BE ARRESTED NOWWHEN A WORD FROM ME COULD SAVE HIM CHAPTER VI THE INQUEST IN THE INTERVAL BEFORE THE INQUEST POIROT WAS UNFAILING IN HIS ACTIVITY TWICE HE WAS CLOSETED WITH MR WELLS HE ALSO TOOK LONG WALKS INTO THE COUNTRY I RATHER RESENTED HIS NOT TAKING ME INTO HIS CONFIDENCE THE MORE SO AS I COULD NOT IN THE LEAST GUESS WHAT HE WAS DRIVING AT IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MAKING INQUIRIES AT RAIKESS FARM SO FINDING HIM OUT WHEN I CALLED AT LEASTWAYS COTTAGE ON WEDNESDAY EVENING I WALKED OVER THERE BY THE FIELDS HOPING TO MEET HIM BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIM AND I HESITATED TO GO RIGHT UP TO THE FARM ITSELF AS I WALKED AWAY I MET AN AGED RUSTIC WHO LEERED AT ME CUNNINGLY YOUM FROM THE HALL BAINT YOU HE ASKED YES IM LOOKING FOR A FRIEND OF MINE WHOM I THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE WALKED THIS WAY A LITTLE CHAP AS WAVES HIS HANDS WHEN HE TALKS ONE OF THEM BELGIES FROM THE VILLAGE YES I SAID EAGERLY HE HAS BEEN HERE THEN OH AY HES BEEN HERE RIGHT ENOUGH MOREN ONCE TOO FRIEND OF YOURS IS HE AH YOU GENTLEMEN FROM THE HALLYOUM A PRETTY LOT AND HE LEERED MORE JOCOSELY THAN EVER WHY DO THE GENTLEMEN FROM THE HALL COME HERE OFTEN I ASKED AS CARELESSLY AS I COULD HE WINKED AT ME KNOWINGLY ONE DOES MISTER NAMING NO NAMES MIND AND A VERY LIBERAL GENTLEMAN TOO OH THANK YOU SIR IM SURE I WALKED ON SHARPLY EVELYN HOWARD HAD BEEN RIGHT THEN AND I EXPERIENCED A SHARP TWINGE OF DISGUST AS I THOUGHT OF ALFRED INGLETHORPS LIBERALITY WITH ANOTHER WOMANS MONEY HAD THAT PIQUANT GIPSY FACE BEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRIME OR WAS IT THE BASER MAINSPRING OF MONEY PROBABLY A JUDICIOUS MIXTURE OF BOTH ON ONE POINT POIROT SEEMED TO HAVE A CURIOUS OBSESSION HE ONCE OR TWICE OBSERVED TO ME THAT HE THOUGHT DORCAS MUST HAVE MADE AN ERROR IN FIXING THE TIME OF THE QUARREL HE SUGGESTED TO HER REPEATEDLY THAT IT WAS FOURTHIRTY AND NOT FOUR OCLOCK WHEN SHE HAD HEARD THE VOICES BUT DORCAS WAS UNSHAKEN QUITE AN HOUR OR EVEN MORE HAD ELAPSED BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN SHE HAD HEARD THE VOICES AND FIVE OCLOCK WHEN SHE HAD TAKEN TEA TO HER MISTRESS THE INQUEST WAS HELD ON FRIDAY AT THE STYLITES ARMS IN THE VILLAGE POIROT AND I SAT TOGETHER NOT BEING REQUIRED TO GIVE EVIDENCE THE PRELIMINARIES WERE GONE THROUGH THE JURY VIEWED THE BODY AND JOHN CAVENDISH GAVE EVIDENCE OF IDENTIFICATION FURTHER QUESTIONED HE DESCRIBED HIS AWAKENING IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS MOTHERS DEATH THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE WAS NEXT TAKEN THERE WAS A BREATHLESS HUSH AND EVERY EYE WAS FIXED ON THE FAMOUS LONDON SPECIALIST WHO WAS KNOWN TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST AUTHORITIES OF THE DAY ON THE SUBJECT OF TOXICOLOGY IN A FEW BRIEF WORDS HE SUMMED UP THE RESULT OF THE POSTMORTEM SHORN OF ITS MEDICAL PHRASEOLOGY AND TECHNICALITIES IT AMOUNTED TO THE FACT THAT MRS INGLETHORP HAD MET HER DEATH AS THE RESULT OF STRYCHNINE POISONING JUDGING FROM THE QUANTITY RECOVERED SHE MUST HAVE TAKEN NOT LESS THAN THREEQUARTERS OF A GRAIN OF STRYCHNINE BUT PROBABLY ONE GRAIN OR SLIGHTLY OVER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE COULD HAVE SWALLOWED THE POISON BY ACCIDENT ASKED THE CORONER I SHOULD CONSIDER IT VERY UNLIKELY STRYCHNINE IS NOT USED FOR DOMESTIC PURPOSES AS SOME POISONS ARE AND THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON ITS SALE DOES ANYTHING IN YOUR EXAMINATION LEAD YOU TO DETERMINE HOW THE POISON WAS ADMINISTERED NO YOU ARRIVED AT STYLES BEFORE DR WILKINS I BELIEVE THAT IS SO THE MOTOR MET ME JUST OUTSIDE THE LODGE GATES AND I HURRIED THERE AS FAST AS I COULD WILL YOU RELATE TO US EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED NEXT I ENTERED MRS INGLETHORPS ROOM SHE WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN A TYPICAL TETANIC CONVULSION SHE TURNED TOWARDS ME AND GASPED OUT ALFREDALFRED COULD THE STRYCHNINE HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED IN MRS INGLETHORPS AFTERDINNER COFFEE WHICH WAS TAKEN TO HER BY HER HUSBAND POSSIBLY BUT STRYCHNINE IS A FAIRLY RAPID DRUG IN ITS ACTION THE SYMPTOMS APPEAR FROM ONE TO TWO HOURS AFTER IT HAS BEEN SWALLOWED IT IS RETARDED UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS NONE OF WHICH HOWEVER APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN PRESENT IN THIS CASE I PRESUME MRS INGLETHORP TOOK THE COFFEE AFTER DINNER ABOUT EIGHT OCLOCK WHEREAS THE SYMPTOMS DID NOT MANIFEST THEMSELVES UNTIL THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING WHICH ON THE FACE OF IT POINTS TO THE DRUG HAVING BEEN TAKEN MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING MRS INGLETHORP WAS IN THE HABIT OF DRINKING A CUP OF COCOA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT COULD THE STRYCHNINE HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED IN THAT NO I MYSELF TOOK A SAMPLE OF THE COCOA REMAINING IN THE SAUCEPAN AND HAD IT ANALYSED THERE WAS NO STRYCHNINE PRESENT I HEARD POIROT CHUCKLE SOFTLY BESIDE ME HOW DID YOU KNOW I WHISPERED LISTEN I SHOULD SAYTHE DOCTOR WAS CONTINUINGTHAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY SURPRISED AT ANY OTHER RESULT WHY SIMPLY BECAUSE STRYCHNINE HAS AN UNUSUALLY BITTER TASTE IT CAN BE DETECTED IN A SOLUTION OF ONE IN SEVENTY THOUSAND AND CAN ONLY BE DISGUISED BY SOME STRONGLY FLAVOURED SUBSTANCE COCOA WOULD BE QUITE POWERLESS TO MASK IT ONE OF THE JURY WANTED TO KNOW IF THE SAME OBJECTION APPLIED TO COFFEE NO COFFEE HAS A BITTER TASTE OF ITS OWN WHICH WOULD PROBABLY COVER THE TASTE OF STRYCHNINE THEN YOU CONSIDER IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE DRUG WAS ADMINISTERED IN THE COFFEE BUT THAT FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON ITS ACTION WAS DELAYED YES BUT THE CUP BEING COMPLETELY SMASHED THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF ANALYZING ITS CONTENTS THIS CONCLUDED DR BAUERSTEINS EVIDENCE DR WILKINS CORROBORATED IT ON ALL POINTS SOUNDED AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SUICIDE HE REPUDIATED IT UTTERLY THE DECEASED HE SAID SUFFERED FROM A WEAK HEART BUT OTHERWISE ENJOYED PERFECT HEALTH AND WAS OF A CHEERFUL AND WELLBALANCED DISPOSITION SHE WOULD BE ONE OF THE LAST PEOPLE TO TAKE HER OWN LIFE LAWRENCE CAVENDISH WAS NEXT CALLED HIS EVIDENCE WAS QUITE UNIMPORTANT BEING A MERE REPETITION OF THAT OF HIS BROTHER JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO STEP DOWN HE PAUSED AND SAID RATHER HESITATINGLY I SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE A SUGGESTION IF I MAY HE GLANCED DEPRECATINGLY AT THE CORONER WHO REPLIED BRISKLY CERTAINLY MR CAVENDISH WE ARE HERE TO ARRIVE AT THE TRUTH OF THIS MATTER AND WELCOME ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO FURTHER ELUCIDATION IT IS JUST AN IDEA OF MINE EXPLAINED LAWRENCE OF COURSE I MAY BE QUITE WRONG BUT IT STILL SEEMS TO ME THAT MY MOTHERS DEATH MIGHT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY NATURAL MEANS HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT OUT MR CAVENDISH MY MOTHER AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH AND FOR SOME TIME BEFORE IT WAS TAKING A TONIC CONTAINING STRYCHNINE AH SAID THE CORONER THE JURY LOOKED UP INTERESTED I BELIEVE CONTINUED LAWRENCE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A DRUG ADMINISTERED FOR SOME TIME HAS ENDED BY CAUSING DEATH ALSO IS IT NOT POSSIBLE THAT SHE MAY HAVE TAKEN AN OVERDOSE OF HER MEDICINE BY ACCIDENT THIS IS THE FIRST WE HAVE HEARD OF THE DECEASED TAKING STRYCHNINE AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH WE ARE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU MR CAVENDISH DR WILKINS WAS RECALLED AND RIDICULED THE IDEA WHAT MR CAVENDISH SUGGESTS IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE ANY DOCTOR WOULD TELL YOU THE SAME STRYCHNINE IS IN A CERTAIN SENSE A CUMULATIVE POISON BUT IT WOULD BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT TO RESULT IN SUDDEN DEATH IN THIS WAY THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A LONG PERIOD OF CHRONIC SYMPTOMS WHICH WOULD AT ONCE HAVE ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION THE WHOLE THING IS ABSURD AND THE SECOND SUGGESTION THAT MRS INGLETHORP MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY TAKEN AN OVERDOSE THREE OR EVEN FOUR DOSES WOULD NOT HAVE RESULTED IN DEATH MRS INGLETHORP ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRA LARGE AMOUNT OF MEDICINE MADE UP AT A TIME AS SHE DEALT WITH COOTS THE CASH CHEMISTS IN TADMINSTER SHE WOULD HAVE HAD TO TAKE VERY NEARLY THE WHOLE BOTTLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE AMOUNT OF STRYCHNINE FOUND AT THE POSTMORTEM THEN YOU CONSIDER THAT WE MAY DISMISS THE TONIC AS NOT BEING IN ANY WAY INSTRUMENTAL IN CAUSING HER DEATH CERTAINLY THE SUPPOSITION IS RIDICULOUS THE SAME JURYMAN WHO HAD INTERRUPTED BEFORE HERE SUGGESTED THAT THE CHEMIST WHO MADE UP THE MEDICINE MIGHT HAVE COMMITTED AN ERROR THAT OF COURSE IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE REPLIED THE DOCTOR BUT DORCAS WHO WAS THE NEXT WITNESS CALLED DISPELLED EVEN THAT POSSIBILITY THE MEDICINE HAD NOT BEEN NEWLY MADE UP ON THE CONTRARY MRS INGLETHORP HAD TAKEN THE LAST DOSE ON THE DAY OF HER DEATH SO THE QUESTION OF THE TONIC WAS FINALLY ABANDONED AND THE CORONER PROCEEDED WITH HIS TASK HAVING ELICITED FROM DORCAS HOW SHE HAD BEEN AWAKENED BY THE VIOLENT RINGING OF HER MISTRESSS BELL AND HAD SUBSEQUENTLY ROUSED THE HOUSEHOLD HE PASSED TO THE SUBJECT OF THE QUARREL ON THE PRECEDING AFTERNOON DORCASS EVIDENCE ON THIS POINT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY WHAT POIROT AND I HAD ALREADY HEARD SO I WILL NOT REPEAT IT HERE THE NEXT WITNESS WAS MARY CAVENDISH SHE STOOD VERY UPRIGHT AND SPOKE IN A LOW CLEAR AND PERFECTLY COMPOSED VOICE IN ANSWER TO THE CORONERS QUESTION SHE TOLD HOW HER ALARM CLOCK HAVING AROUSED HER AT FOURTHIRTY AS USUAL SHE WAS DRESSING WHEN SHE WAS STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF SOMETHING HEAVY FALLING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TABLE BY THE BED COMMENTED THE CORONER I OPENED MY DOOR CONTINUED MARY AND LISTENED IN A FEW MINUTES A BELL RANG VIOLENTLY DORCAS CAME RUNNING DOWN AND WOKE MY HUSBAND AND WE ALL WENT TO MY MOTHERINLAWS ROOM BUT IT WAS LOCKED THE CORONER INTERRUPTED HER I REALLY DO NOT THINK WE NEED TROUBLE YOU FURTHER ON THAT POINT WE KNOW ALL THAT CAN BE KNOWN OF THE SUBSEQUENT HAPPENINGS BUT I SHOULD BE OBLIGED IF YOU WOULD TELL US ALL YOU OVERHEARD OF THE QUARREL THE DAY BEFORE I THERE WAS A FAINT INSOLENCE IN HER VOICE SHE RAISED HER HAND AND ADJUSTED THE RUFFLE OF LACE AT HER NECK TURNING HER HEAD A LITTLE AS SHE DID SO AND QUITE SPONTANEOUSLY THE THOUGHT FLASHED ACROSS MY MIND SHE IS GAINING TIME YES I UNDERSTAND CONTINUED THE CORONER DELIBERATELY THAT YOU WERE SITTING READING ON THE BENCH JUST OUTSIDE THE LONG WINDOW OF THE BOUDOIR THAT IS SO IS IT NOT THIS WAS NEWS TO ME AND GLANCING SIDEWAYS AT POIROT I FANCIED THAT IT WAS NEWS TO HIM AS WELL THERE WAS THE FAINTEST PAUSE THE MERE HESITATION OF A MOMENT BEFORE SHE ANSWERED YES THAT IS SO AND THE BOUDOIR WINDOW WAS OPEN WAS IT NOT SURELY HER FACE GREW A LITTLE PALER AS SHE ANSWERED YES THEN YOU CANNOT HAVE FAILED TO HEAR THE VOICES INSIDE ESPECIALLY AS THEY WERE RAISED IN ANGER IN FACT THEY WOULD BE MORE AUDIBLE WHERE YOU WERE THAN IN THE HALL POSSIBLY WILL YOU REPEAT TO US WHAT YOU OVERHEARD OF THE QUARREL I REALLY DO NOT REMEMBER HEARING ANYTHING DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU DID NOT HEAR VOICES OH YES I HEARD THE VOICES BUT I DID NOT HEAR WHAT THEY SAID A FAINT SPOT OF COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEK I AM NOT IN THE HABIT OF LISTENING TO PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS THE CORONER PERSISTED AND YOU REMEMBER NOTHING AT ALL NOTHING MRS CAVENDISH NOT ONE STRAY WORD OR PHRASE TO MAKE YOU REALIZE THAT IT WAS A PRIVATE CONVERSATION SHE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO REFLECT STILL OUTWARDLY AS CALM AS EVER YES I REMEMBER MRS INGLETHORP SAID SOMETHINGI DO NOT REMEMBER EXACTLY WHATABOUT CAUSING SCANDAL BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE AH THE CORONER LEANT BACK SATISFIED THAT CORRESPONDS WITH WHAT DORCAS HEARD BUT EXCUSE ME MRS CAVENDISH ALTHOUGH YOU REALIZED IT WAS A PRIVATE CONVERSATION YOU DID NOT MOVE AWAY YOU REMAINED WHERE YOU WERE I CAUGHT THE MOMENTARY GLEAM OF HER TAWNY EYES AS SHE RAISED THEM I FELT CERTAIN THAT AT THAT MOMENT SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE TORN THE LITTLE LAWYER WITH HIS INSINUATIONS INTO PIECES BUT SHE REPLIED QUIETLY ENOUGH NO I WAS VERY COMFORTABLE WHERE I WAS I FIXED MY MIND ON MY BOOK AND THAT IS ALL YOU CAN TELL US THAT IS ALL THE EXAMINATION WAS OVER THOUGH I DOUBTED IF THE CORONER WAS ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH IT I THINK HE SUSPECTED THAT MARY CAVENDISH COULD TELL MORE IF SHE CHOSE AMY HILL SHOP ASSISTANT WAS NEXT CALLED AND DEPOSED TO HAVING SOLD A WILL FORM ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE TH TO WILLIAM EARL UNDERGARDENER AT STYLES WILLIAM EARL AND MANNING SUCCEEDED HER AND TESTIFIED TO WITNESSING A DOCUMENT MANNING FIXED THE TIME AT ABOUT FOURTHIRTY WILLIAM WAS OF THE OPINION THAT IT WAS RATHER EARLIER CYNTHIA MURDOCH CAME NEXT SHE HAD HOWEVER LITTLE TO TELL SHE HAD KNOWN NOTHING OF THE TRAGEDY UNTIL AWAKENED BY MRS CAVENDISH YOU DID NOT HEAR THE TABLE FALL NO I WAS FAST ASLEEP THE CORONER SMILED A GOOD CONSCIENCE MAKES A SOUND SLEEPER HE OBSERVED THANK YOU MISS MURDOCH THAT IS ALL MISS HOWARD MISS HOWARD PRODUCED THE LETTER WRITTEN TO HER BY MRS INGLETHORP ON THE EVENING OF THE TH POIROT AND I HAD OF COURSE ALREADY SEEN IT IT ADDED NOTHING TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRAGEDY THE

MENTION OF ANY OF THE EVENTS OF THAT AFTERNOON PLAIN AS A PIKESTAFF TO ME SAID MISS HOWARD SHORTLY IT SHOWS CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT MY POOR OLD FRIEND HAD JUST FOUND OUT SHED BEEN MADE A FOOL OF IT SAYS NOTHING OF THE KIND IN THE LETTER THE CORONER POINTED OUT NO BECAUSE EMILY NEVER COULD BEAR TO PUT HERSELF IN THE WRONG BUT I KNOW HER SHE WANTED ME BACK BUT SHE WASNT GOING TO OWN THAT ID BEEN RIGHT SHE WENT ROUND ABOUT MOST PEOPLE DO DONT BELIEVE IN IT MYSELF MR WELLS SMILED FAINTLY SO I NOTICED DID SEVERAL OF THE JURY MISS HOWARD WAS OBVIOUSLY QUITE A PUBLIC CHARACTER ANYWAY ALL THIS TOMFOOLERY IS A GREAT WASTE OF TIME CONTINUED THE LADY GLANCING UP AND DOWN THE JURY DISPARAGINGLY TALKTALKTALK WHEN ALL THE TIME WE KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THE CORONER INTERRUPTED HER IN AN AGONY OF APPREHENSION THANK YOU MISS HOWARD THAT IS ALL I FANCY HE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF WHEN SHE COMPLIED THEN CAME THE SENSATION OF THE DAY THE CORONER CALLED ALBERT MACE CHEMISTS ASSISTANT IT WAS OUR AGITATED YOUNG MAN OF THE PALE FACE IN ANSWER TO THE CORONERS QUESTIONS HE EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS A QUALIFIED PHARMACIST BUT HAD ONLY RECENTLY COME TO THIS PARTICULAR SHOP AS THE ASSISTANT FORMERLY THERE HAD JUST

WAS SITTING IMPASSIVE AND WOODEN HE STARTED SLIGHTLY AS THE DAMNING WORDS FELL FROM THE YOUNG MANS LIPS I HALF THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO RISE FROM HIS CHAIR BUT HE REMAINED SEATED ALTHOUGH A REMARKABLY WELL ACTED EXPRESSION OF ASTONISHMENT ROSE ON HIS FACE YOU ARE SURE OF WHAT YOU SAY ASKED THE CORONER STERNLY QUITE SURE SIR ARE YOU IN THE HABIT OF SELLING STRYCHNINE INDISCRIMINATELY OVER THE COUNTER THE WRETCHED YOUNG MAN WILTED VISIBLY UNDER THE CORONERS FROWN OH NO SIROF COURSE NOT BUT SEEING IT WAS MR INGLETHORP OF THE HALL I THOUGHT THERE WAS NO HARM IN IT HE SAID IT WAS TO POISON A DOG INWARDLY I SYMPATHIZED IT WAS ONLY HUMAN NATURE TO ENDEAVOUR TO PLEASE THE HALLESPECIALLY WHEN IT MIGHT RESULT IN CUSTOM BEING TRANSFERRED FROM COOTS TO THE LOCAL ESTABLISHMENT IS IT NOT CUSTOMARY FOR ANYONE PURCHASING POISON TO SIGN A BOOK YES SIR MR INGLETHORP DID SO HAVE YOU GOT THE BOOK HERE YES SIR IT WAS PRODUCED AND WITH A FEW WORDS OF STERN CENSURE THE CORONER DISMISSED THE WRETCHED MR MACE THEN AMIDST A BREATHLESS SILENCE ALFRED INGLETHORP WAS CALLED DID HE REALIZE I WONDERED HOW CLOSELY THE HALTER WAS BEING DRAWN AROUND HIS NECK THE CORONER WENT STRAIGHT TO THE POINT ON MONDAY EVENING LAST DID YOU PURCHASE STRYCHNINE FOR THE PURPOSE OF POISONING A DOG INGLETHORP REPLIED WITH PERFECT CALMNESS NO I DID NOT THERE IS NO DOG AT STYLES EXCEPT AN OUTDOOR SHEEPDOG WHICH IS IN PERFECT HEALTH YOU DENY ABSOLUTELY HAVING PURCHASED STRYCHNINE FROM ALBERT MACE ON MONDAY LAST I DO DO YOU ALSO DENY THIS THE CORONER HANDED HIM THE REGISTER IN WHICH HIS SIGNATURE WAS INSCRIBED CERTAINLY I DO THE HANDWRITING IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM MINE I WILL SHOW YOU HE TOOK AN OLD ENVELOPE OUT OF HIS POCKET AND WROTE HIS NAME ON IT HANDING IT TO THE JURY IT WAS CERTAINLY UTTERLY DISSIMILAR THEN WHAT IS YOUR EXPLANATION OF MR MACES STATEMENT ALFRED INGLETHORP REPLIED IMPERTURBABLY MR MACE MUST HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN THE CORONER HESITATED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID MR INGLETHORP AS A MERE MATTER OF FORM WOULD YOU MIND TELLING US WHERE YOU WERE ON THE EVENING OF MONDAY JULY TH REALLYI CANNOT REMEMBER THAT IS ABSURD MR INGLETHORP SAID THE CORONER SHARPLY THINK AGAIN INGLETHORP SHOOK HIS HEAD I CANNOT TELL YOU I HAVE AN IDEA THAT I WAS OUT WALKING IN WHAT DIRECTION I REALLY CANT REMEMBER THE CORONERS FACE GREW GRAVER WERE YOU IN COMPANY WITH ANYONE NO DID YOU MEET ANYONE ON YOUR WALK NO THAT IS A PITY SAID THE CORONER DRYLY I AM TO TAKE IT THEN THAT YOU DECLINE TO SAY WHERE YOU WERE AT THE TIME THAT MR MACE POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED YOU AS ENTERING THE SHOP TO PURCHASE STRYCHNINE IF YOU LIKE TO TAKE IT THAT WAY YES BE CAREFUL MR INGLETHORP POIROT WAS FIDGETING NERVOUSLY SACR HE MURMURED DOES THIS IMBECILE OF A MAN WANT TO BE ARRESTED INGLETHORP WAS INDEED CREATING A BAD IMPRESSION HIS FUTILE DENIALS WOULD NOT HAVE CONVINCED A CHILD THE CORONER HOWEVER PASSED BRISKLY TO THE NEXT POINT AND POIROT DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF YOU HAD A DISCUSSION WITH YOUR WIFE ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON PARDON ME INTERRUPTED ALFRED INGLETHORP YOU HAVE BEEN MISINFORMED I HAD NO QUARREL WITH MY DEAR WIFE THE WHOLE STORY IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE I WAS ABSENT FROM THE HOUSE THE ENTIRE AFTERNOON HAVE YOU ANYONE WHO CAN TESTIFY TO THAT YOU HAVE MY WORD SAID INGLETHORP HAUGHTILY THE CORONER DID NOT TROUBLE TO REPLY THERE ARE TWO WITNESSES WHO WILL SWEAR TO HAVING HEARD YOUR DISAGREEMENT WITH MRS INGLETHORP THOSE WITNESSES WERE MISTAKEN I WAS PUZZLED THE MAN SPOKE WITH SUCH QUIET ASSURANCE THAT I WAS STAGGERED I LOOKED AT POIROT THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF EXULTATION ON HIS FACE WHICH I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WAS HE AT LAST CONVINCED OF ALFRED INGLETHORPS GUILT MR INGLETHORP SAID THE CORONER YOU HAVE HEARD YOUR WIFES DYING WORDS REPEATED HERE CAN YOU EXPLAIN THEM IN ANY WAY CERTAINLY I CAN YOU CAN IT SEEMS TO ME VERY SIMPLE THE ROOM WAS DIMLY LIGHTED DR BAUERSTEIN IS MUCH OF MY HEIGHT AND BUILD AND LIKE ME WEARS A BEARD IN THE DIM LIGHT AND SUFFERING AS SHE WAS MY POOR WIFE MISTOOK HIM FOR ME AH MURMURED POIROT TO HIMSELF BUT IT IS AN IDEA THAT YOU THINK IT IS TRUE I WHISPERED I DO NOT SAY THAT BUT IT IS TRULY AN INGENIOUS SUPPOSITION YOU READ MY WIFES LAST WORDS AS AN ACCUSATIONINGLETHORP WAS CONTINUINGTHEY WERE ON THE CONTRARY AN APPEAL TO ME THE CORONER REFLECTED A MOMENT THEN HE SAID I BELIEVE MR INGLETHORP THAT YOU YOURSELF POURED OUT THE COFFEE AND TOOK IT TO YOUR WIFE THAT EVENING I POURED IT OUT YES BUT I DID NOT TAKE IT TO HER I MEANT TO DO SO BUT I WAS TOLD THAT A FRIEND WAS AT THE HALL DOOR SO I LAID DOWN THE COFFEE ON THE HALL TABLE WHEN I CAME THROUGH THE HALL AGAIN A FEW MINUTES LATER IT WAS GONE THIS STATEMENT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE TRUE BUT IT DID NOT SEEM TO ME TO IMPROVE MATTERS MUCH FOR INGLETHORP IN ANY CASE HE HAD HAD AMPLE TIME TO INTRODUCE THE POISON AT THAT POINT POIROT NUDGED ME GENTLY INDICATING TWO MEN WHO WERE SITTING TOGETHER NEAR THE DOOR ONE WAS A LITTLE SHARP DARK FERRETFACED MAN THE OTHER WAS TALL AND FAIR I QUESTIONED POIROT MUTELY HE PUT HIS LIPS TO MY EAR DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT LITTLE MAN IS I SHOOK MY HEAD THAT IS DETECTIVE INSPECTOR JAMES JAPP OF SCOTLAND YARDJIMMY JAPP THE OTHER MAN IS FROM SCOTLAND YARD TOO THINGS ARE MOVING QUICKLY MY FRIEND I STARED AT THE TWO MEN INTENTLY THERE WAS CERTAINLY NOTHING OF THE POLICEMAN ABOUT THEM I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SUSPECTED THEM OF BEING OFFICIAL PERSONAGES I WAS STILL STARING WHEN I WAS STARTLED AND RECALLED BY THE VERDICT BEING GIVEN WILFUL MURDER AGAINST SOME PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN CHAPTER VII POIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS AS WE CAME OUT OF THE STYLITES ARMS POIROT DREW ME ASIDE BY A GENTLE PRESSURE OF THE ARM I UNDERSTOOD HIS OBJECT HE WAS WAITING FOR THE SCOTLAND YARD MEN IN A FEW MOMENTS THEY EMERGED AND POIROT AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD AND ACCOSTED THE SHORTER OF THE TWO I FEAR YOU DO NOT REMEMBER ME INSPECTOR JAPP WHY IF IT ISNT MR POIROT CRIED THE INSPECTOR HE TURNED TO THE OTHER MAN YOUVE HEARD ME SPEAK OF MR POIROT IT WAS IN HE AND I WORKED TOGETHERTHE ABERCROMBIE FORGERY CASEYOU REMEMBER HE WAS RUN DOWN IN BRUSSELS AH THOSE WERE GREAT DAYS MOOSIER THEN DO YOU REMEMBER BARON ALTARA THERE WAS A PRETTY ROGUE FOR YOU HE ELUDED THE CLUTCHES OF HALF THE POLICE IN EUROPE BUT WE NAILED HIM IN ANTWERPTHANKS TO MR POIROT HERE AS THESE FRIENDLY REMINISCENCES WERE BEING INDULGED IN I DREW NEARER AND WAS INTRODUCED TO DETECTIVEINSPECTOR JAPP WHO

HE COULD BE SUCH A FOOL BEATS ME BUT JAPP WAS LOOKING ATTENTIVELY AT POIROT HOLD YOUR FIRE SUMMERHAYE HE REMARKED JOCULARLY ME AND MOOSIER HERE HAVE MET BEFOREAND THERES NO MANS JUDGMENT ID SOONER TAKE THAN HIS IF IM NOT GREATLY MISTAKEN HES GOT SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVE ISNT THAT SO MOOSIER POIROT SMILED I HAVE DRAWN CERTAIN CONCLUSIONSYES SUMMERHAYE WAS STILL LOOKING RATHER SCEPTICAL BUT JAPP CONTINUED HIS SCRUTINY OF POIROT ITS THIS WAY HE SAID SO FAR WEVE ONLY SEEN THE CASE FROM THE OUTSIDE THATS WHERE THE YARDS AT A DISADVANTAGE IN A CASE OF THIS KIND WHERE THE MURDERS ONLY OUT SO TO SPEAK AFTER THE INQUEST A LOT DEPENDS ON BEING ON THE SPOT FIRST THING AND THATS WHERE MR POIROTS HAD THE START OF US WE SHOULDNT HAVE BEEN HERE AS SOON AS THIS EVEN IF IT HADNT BEEN FOR THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A SMART DOCTOR ON THE SPOT WHO GAVE US THE TIP THROUGH THE CORONER BUT YOUVE BEEN ON THE SPOT FROM THE FIRST AND YOU MAY HAVE PICKED UP SOME LITTLE HINTS FROM THE EVIDENCE AT THE INQUEST MR INGLETHORP MURDERED HIS WIFE AS SURE AS I STAND HERE AND IF ANYONE BUT YOU HINTED THE CONTRARY ID LAUGH IN HIS FACE I MUST SAY I WAS SURPRISED THE JURY DIDNT BRING IT IN WILFUL MURDER AGAINST HIM RIGHT OFF I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE IF IT HADNT BEEN FOR THE CORONERHE SEEMED TO BE HOLDING THEM BACK PERHAPS THOUGH YOU HAVE A WARRANT FOR HIS ARREST IN YOUR POCKET NOW SUGGESTED POIROT A KIND OF WOODEN SHUTTER OF OFFICIALDOM CAME DOWN FROM JAPPS EXPRESSIVE COUNTENANCE PERHAPS I HAVE AND PERHAPS I HAVENT HE REMARKED DRYLY POIROT LOOKED AT HIM THOUGHTFULLY I AM VERY ANXIOUS MESSIEURS THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE ARRESTED I DARE SAY OBSERVED SUMMERHAYE SARCASTICALLY JAPP WAS REGARDING POIROT WITH COMICAL PERPLEXITY CANT YOU GO A LITTLE FURTHER MR POIROT A WINKS AS GOOD AS A NODFROM YOU YOUVE BEEN ON THE SPOTAND THE YARD DOESNT WANT TO MAKE ANY MISTAKES YOU KNOW POIROT NODDED GRAVELY THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT WELL I WILL TELL YOU THIS USE YOUR WARRANT ARREST MR INGLETHORP BUT IT WILL BRING YOU NO KUDOSTHE CASE AGAINST HIM WILL BE DISMISSED AT ONCE COMME A AND HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERS EXPRESSIVELY JAPPS FACE GREW GRAVE THOUGH SUMMERHAYE GAVE AN INCREDULOUS SNORT AS FOR ME I WAS LITERALLY DUMB WITH ASTONISHMENT I COULD ONLY CONCLUDE THAT POIROT WAS MAD JAPP HAD TAKEN OUT A HANDKERCHIEF AND WAS GENTLY DABBING HIS BROW I DARENT DO IT MR POIROT ID TAKE YOUR WORD BUT THERES OTHERS OVER ME WHOLL BE ASKING WHAT THE DEVIL I MEAN BY IT CANT YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE TO GO ON POIROT REFLECTED A MOMENT IT CAN BE DONE HE SAID AT LAST I ADMIT I DO NOT WISH IT IT FORCES MY HAND I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO WORK IN THE DARK JUST FOR THE PRESENT BUT WHAT YOU SAY IS VERY JUSTTHE WORD OF A BELGIAN POLICEMAN WHOSE DAY IS PAST IS NOT ENOUGH AND ALFRED INGLETHORP MUST NOT BE ARRESTED THAT I HAVE SWORN AS MY FRIEND HASTINGS HERE KNOWS SEE THEN MY GOOD JAPP YOU GO AT ONCE TO STYLES WELL IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WERE SEEING THE CORONER AND THE DOCTOR FIRST GOOD CALL FOR ME IN PASSINGTHE LAST HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE I WILL GO WITH YOU AT STYLES MR INGLETHORP WILL GIVE YOU OR IF HE REFUSESAS IS PROBABLEI WILL GIVE YOU SUCH PROOFS THAT SHALL SATISFY YOU THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE SUSTAINED IS THAT A BARGAIN THATS A BARGAIN SAID JAPP HEARTILY AND ON BEHALF OF THE YARD IM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU THOUGH IM BOUND TO CONFESS I CANT AT PRESENT SEE THE FAINTEST POSSIBLE LOOPHOLE IN THE EVIDENCE BUT YOU ALWAYS WERE A MARVEL SO LONG THEN MOOSIER THE TWO DETECTIVES STRODE AWAY SUMMERHAYE WITH AN INCREDULOUS GRIN ON HIS FACE WELL MY FRIEND CRIED POIROT BEFORE I COULD GET IN A WORD WHAT DO YOU THINK MON DIEU I HAD SOME WARM MOMENTS IN THAT COURT I DID NOT FIGURE TO MYSELF THAT THE MAN WOULD BE SO PIGHEADED AS TO REFUSE TO SAY ANYTHING AT ALL DECIDEDLY IT WAS THE POLICY OF AN IMBECILE HM THERE ARE OTHER EXPLANATIONS BESIDES THAT OF IMBECILITY I REMARKED FOR IF THE CASE AGAINST HIM IS TRUE HOW COULD HE DEFEND HIMSELF EXCEPT BY SILENCE WHY IN A THOUSAND INGENIOUS WAYS CRIED POIROT SEE SAY THAT IT IS I WHO HAVE COMMITTED THIS MURDER I CAN THINK OF SEVEN MOST PLAUSIBLE STORIES FAR MORE CONVINCING THAN MR INGLETHORPS STONY DENIALS I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING MY DEAR POIROT I AM SURE YOU ARE CAPABLE OF THINKING OF SEVENTY BUT SERIOUSLY IN SPITE OF WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY TO THE DETECTIVES YOU SURELY CANNOT STILL BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF ALFRED INGLETHORPS INNOCENCE WHY NOT NOW AS MUCH AS BEFORE NOTHING HAS CHANGED BUT THE EVIDENCE IS SO CONCLUSIVE YES TOO CONCLUSIVE WE TURNED IN AT THE GATE OF LEASTWAYS COTTAGE AND PROCEEDED UP THE NOW FAMILIAR STAIRS YES YES TOO CONCLUSIVE CONTINUED POIROT ALMOST TO HIMSELF REAL EVIDENCE IS USUALLY VAGUE AND UNSATISFACTORY IT HAS TO BE EXAMINEDSIFTED BUT HERE THE WHOLE THING IS CUT AND DRIED NO MY FRIEND THIS EVIDENCE HAS BEEN VERY CLEVERLY MANUFACTUREDSO CLEVERLY THAT IT HAS DEFEATED ITS OWN ENDS HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT OUT BECAUSE SO LONG AS THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM WAS VAGUE AND INTANGIBLE IT WAS VERY HARD TO DISPROVE BUT IN HIS ANXIETY THE CRIMINAL HAS DRAWN THE NET SO CLOSELY THAT ONE CUT WILL SET INGLETHORP FREE I WAS SILENT AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO POIROT CONTINUED LET US LOOK AT THE MATTER LIKE THIS HERE IS A MAN LET US SAY WHO SETS OUT TO POISON HIS WIFE HE HAS LIVED BY HIS WITS AS THE SAYING GOES PRESUMABLY THEREFORE HE HAS SOME WITS HE IS NOT ALTOGETHER A FOOL WELL HOW DOES HE SET ABOUT IT HE GOES BOLDLY TO THE VILLAGE CHEMISTS AND PURCHASES STRYCHNINE UNDER HIS OWN NAME WITH A TRUMPED UP STORY ABOUT A DOG WHICH IS BOUND TO BE PROVED ABSURD HE DOES NOT EMPLOY THE POISON THAT NIGHT NO HE WAITS UNTIL HE HAS HAD A VIOLENT QUARREL WITH HER OF WHICH THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD IS COGNISANT AND WHICH NATURALLY DIRECTS THEIR SUSPICIONS UPON HIM HE PREPARES NO DEFENCENO SHADOW OF AN ALIBI YET HE KNOWS THE CHEMISTS ASSISTANT MUST NECESSARILY COME FORWARD WITH THE FACTS BAH DO NOT ASK ME TO BELIEVE THAT ANY MAN COULD BE SO IDIOTIC ONLY A LUNATIC WHO WISHED TO COMMIT SUICIDE BY CAUSING HIMSELF TO BE HANGED WOULD ACT SO STILLI DO NOT SEE I BEGAN NEITHER DO I SEE I TELL YOU MON AMI IT PUZZLES ME MEHERCULE POIROT BUT IF YOU BELIEVE HIM INNOCENT HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN HIS BUYING THE STRYCHNINE VERY SIMPLY HE DID NOT BUY IT BUT MACE RECOGNIZED HIM I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAW A MAN WITH A BLACK BEARD LIKE MR INGLETHORPS AND WEARING GLASSES LIKE MR INGLETHORP AND DRESSED IN MR INGLETHORPS RATHER NOTICEABLE CLOTHES HE COULD NOT RECOGNIZE A MAN WHOM HE HAD PROBABLY ONLY SEEN IN THE DISTANCE SINCE YOU REMEMBER HE HIMSELF HAD ONLY BEEN IN THE VILLAGE A FORTNIGHT AND MRS INGLETHORP DEALT PRINCIPALLY WITH COOTS IN TADMINSTER THEN YOU THINK MON AMI DO YOU REMEMBER THE TWO POINTS I LAID STRESS UPON LEAVE THE FIRST ONE FOR THE MOMENT WHAT WAS THE SECOND THE IMPORTANT FACT THAT ALFRED INGLETHORP WEARS PECULIAR CLOTHES HAS A BLACK BEARD AND USES GLASSES I QUOTED EXACTLY NOW SUPPOSE ANYONE WISHED TO PASS HIMSELF OFF AS JOHN OR LAWRENCE CAVENDISH WOULD IT BE EASY NO I SAID THOUGHTFULLY OF COURSE AN ACTOR BUT POIROT CUT ME SHORT RUTHLESSLY AND WHY WOULD IT NOT BE EASY I WILL TELL YOU MY FRIEND BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH CLEANSHAVEN MEN TO MAKE UP SUCCESSFULLY AS ONE OF THESE TWO IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IT WOULD NEED AN ACTOR OF GENIUS AND A CERTAIN INITIAL FACIAL RESEMBLANCE BUT IN THE CASE OF ALFRED INGLETHORP ALL THAT IS CHANGED HIS CLOTHES HIS BEARD THE GLASSES WHICH HIDE HIS EYESTHOSE ARE THE SALIENT POINTS ABOUT HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE NOW WHAT IS THE FIRST INSTINCT OF THE CRIMINAL TO DIVERT SUSPICION FROM HIMSELF IS IT NOT SO AND HOW CAN HE BEST DO THAT BY THROWING IT ON SOMEONE ELSE IN THIS INSTANCE THERE WAS A MAN READY TO HIS HAND EVERYBODY WAS PREDISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN MR INGLETHORPS GUILT IT WAS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION THAT HE WOULD BE SUSPECTED BUT TO MAKE IT A SURE THING THERE MUST BE TANGIBLE PROOFSUCH AS THE ACTUAL BUYING OF THE POISON AND THAT WITH A MAN OF THE PECULIAR APPEARANCE OF MR INGLETHORP WAS NOT DIFFICULT REMEMBER THIS YOUNG MACE HAD NEVER ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO MR INGLETHORP HOW SHOULD HE DOUBT THAT THE MAN IN HIS CLOTHES WITH HIS BEARD AND HIS GLASSES WAS NOT ALFRED INGLETHORP IT MAY BE SO I SAID FASCINATED BY POIROTS ELOQUENCE BUT IF THAT WAS THE CASE WHY DOES HE NOT SAY WHERE HE WAS AT SIX OCLOCK ON MONDAY EVENING AH WHY INDEED SAID POIROT CALMING DOWN IF HE WERE ARRESTED HE PROBABLY WOULD SPEAK BUT I DO NOT WANT IT TO COME TO THAT I MUST MAKE HIM SEE THE GRAVITY OF HIS POSITION THERE IS OF COURSE SOMETHING DISCREDITABLE BEHIND HIS SILENCE IF HE DID NOT MURDER HIS WIFE HE IS NEVERTHELESS A SCOUNDREL AND HAS SOMETHING OF HIS OWN TO CONCEAL QUITE APART FROM THE MURDER WHAT CAN IT BE I MUSED WON OVER TO POIROTS VIEWS FOR THE MOMENT ALTHOUGH STILL RETAINING A FAINT CONVICTION THAT THE OBVIOUS DEDUCTION WAS THE CORRECT ONE CAN YOU NOT GUESS ASKED POIROT SMILING NO CAN YOU OH YES I HAD A LITTLE IDEA SOMETIME AGOAND IT HAS TURNED OUT TO BE CORRECT YOU NEVER TOLD ME I SAID REPROACHFULLY POIROT SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS APOLOGETICALLY PARDON ME MON AMI YOU WERE NOT PRECISELY SYMPATHIQUE HE TURNED TO ME EARNESTLY TELL MEYOU SEE NOW THAT HE MUST NOT BE ARRESTED PERHAPS I SAID DOUBTFULLY FOR I WAS REALLY QUITE INDIFFERENT TO THE FATE OF ALFRED INGLETHORP AND THOUGHT THAT A GOOD FRIGHT WOULD DO HIM NO HARM POIROT WHO WAS WATCHING ME INTENTLY GAVE A SIGH COME MY FRIEND HE SAID CHANGING THE SUBJECT APART FROM MR INGLETHORP HOW DID THE EVIDENCE AT THE INQUEST STRIKE YOU OH PRETTY MUCH WHAT I EXPECTED DID NOTHING STRIKE YOU AS PECULIAR ABOUT IT MY THOUGHTS FLEW TO MARY CAVENDISH AND I HEDGED IN WHAT WAY WELL MR LAWRENCE CAVENDISHS EVIDENCE FOR INSTANCE I WAS RELIEVED OH LAWRENCE NO I DONT THINK SO HES ALWAYS A NERVOUS CHAP HIS SUGGESTION THAT HIS MOTHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN POISONED ACCIDENTALLY BY MEANS OF THE TONIC SHE WAS TAKING THAT DID NOT STRIKE YOU AS STRANGE HEIN NO I CANT SAY IT DID THE DOCTORS RIDICULED IT OF COURSE BUT IT WAS QUITE A NATURAL SUGGESTION FOR A LAYMAN TO MAKE BUT MONSIEUR LAWRENCE IS NOT A LAYMAN YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF THAT HE HAD STARTED BY STUDYING MEDICINE AND THAT HE HAD TAKEN HIS DEGREE YES THATS TRUE I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT I WAS RATHER STARTLED IT IS ODD POIROT NODDED FROM THE FIRST HIS BEHAVIOUR HAS BEEN PECULIAR OF ALL THE HOUSEHOLD HE ALONE WOULD BE LIKELY TO RECOGNIZE THE SYMPTOMS OF STRYCHNINE POISONING AND YET WE FIND HIM THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY TO UPHOLD STRENUOUSLY THE THEORY OF DEATH FROM NATURAL CAUSES IF IT HAD BEEN MONSIEUR JOHN I COULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT HE HAS NO TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AND IS BY NATURE UNIMAGINATIVE BUT MONSIEUR LAWRENCENO AND NOW TODAY HE PUTS FORWARD A SUGGESTION THAT HE HIMSELF MUST HAVE KNOWN WAS RIDICULOUS THERE IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN THIS MON AMI ITS VERY CONFUSING I AGREED THEN THERE IS MRS CAVENDISH CONTINUED POIROT THATS ANOTHER WHO IS NOT TELLING ALL SHE KNOWS WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HER ATTITUDE I DONT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT IT SEEMS INCONCEIVABLE THAT SHE SHOULD BE SHIELDING ALFRED INGLETHORP YET THAT IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE POIROT NODDED REFLECTIVELY YES IT IS QUEER ONE THING IS CERTAIN SHE OVERHEARD A GOOD DEAL MORE OF THAT PRIVATE CONVERSATION THAN SHE WAS WILLING TO ADMIT AND YET SHE IS THE LAST PERSON ONE WOULD ACCUSE OF STOOPING TO EAVESDROP EXACTLY ONE THING HER EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN ME I MADE A MISTAKE DORCAS WAS QUITE RIGHT THE QUARREL DID TAKE PLACE EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON ABOUT FOUR OCLOCK AS SHE SAID I LOOKED AT HIM CURIOUSLY I HAD NEVER UNDERSTOOD HIS INSISTENCE ON THAT POINT YES A GOOD DEAL THAT WAS PECULIAR CAME OUT TODAY CONTINUED POIROT DR BAUERSTEIN NOW WHAT WAS HE DOING UP AND DRESSED AT THAT HOUR IN THE MORNING IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME THAT NO ONE COMMENTED ON THE FACT HE HAS INSOMNIA I BELIEVE I SAID DOUBTFULLY WHICH IS A VERY GOOD OR A VERY BAD EXPLANATION REMARKED POIROT IT COVERS EVERYTHING AND EXPLAINS NOTHING I SHALL KEEP MY EYE ON OUR CLEVER DR BAUERSTEIN ANY MORE FAULTS TO FIND WITH THE EVIDENCE I INQUIRED SATIRICALLY MON AMI REPLIED POIROT GRAVELY WHEN YOU FIND THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT TELLING YOU THE TRUTHLOOK OUT NOW UNLESS I AM MUCH MISTAKEN AT THE INQUEST TODAY ONLY ONEAT MOST TWO PERSONS WERE SPEAKING THE TRUTH WITHOUT RESERVATION OR SUBTERFUGE OH COME NOW POIROT I WONT CITE LAWRENCE OR MRS CAVENDISH BUT THERES JOHNAND MISS HOWARD SURELY THEY WERE SPEAKING THE TRUTH BOTH OF THEM MY FRIEND ONE I GRANT YOU BUT BOTH HIS WORDS GAVE ME AN UNPLEASANT SHOCK MISS HOWARDS EVIDENCE UNIMPORTANT AS IT WAS HAD BEEN GIVEN IN SUCH A DOWNRIGHT STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER THAT IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO DOUBT HER SINCERITY STILL I HAD A GREAT RESPECT FOR POIROTS SAGACITYEXCEPT ON THE OCCASIONS WHEN HE WAS WHAT I DESCRIBED TO MYSELF AS FOOLISHLY PIGHEADED DO YOU REALLY THINK SO I ASKED MISS HOWARD HAD ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME SO ESSENTIALLY HONESTALMOST UNCOMFORTABLY SO POIROT GAVE ME A CURIOUS LOOK WHICH I COULD NOT QUITE FATHOM HE SEEMED TO SPEAK AND THEN CHECKED HIMSELF MISS MURDOCH TOO I CONTINUED THERES NOTHING UNTRUTHFUL ABOUT HER NO BUT IT WAS STRANGE THAT SHE NEVER HEARD A SOUND SLEEPING NEXT DOOR WHEREAS MRS CAVENDISH IN THE OTHER WING OF THE BUILDING DISTINCTLY HEARD THE TABLE FALL WELL SHES YOUNG AND SHE SLEEPS SOUNDLY AH YES INDEED SHE MUST BE A FAMOUS SLEEPER THAT ONE I DID NOT QUITE LIKE THE TONE OF HIS VOICE BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SMART KNOCK REACHED OUR EARS AND LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW WE PERCEIVED THE TWO DETECTIVES WAITING FOR US BELOW POIROT SEIZED HIS HAT GAVE A FEROCIOUS TWIST TO HIS MOUSTACHE AND CAREFULLY BRUSHING AN IMAGINARY SPECK OF DUST FROM HIS SLEEVE MOTIONED ME TO PRECEDE HIM DOWN THE STAIRS THERE WE JOINED THE DETECTIVES AND SET OUT FOR STYLES I THINK THE APPEARANCE OF THE TWO SCOTLAND YARD MEN WAS RATHER A SHOCKESPECIALLY TO JOHN THOUGH OF COURSE AFTER THE VERDICT HE HAD REALIZED THAT IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME STILL THE PRESENCE OF THE DETECTIVES BROUGHT THE TRUTH HOME TO HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE COULD HAVE DONE POIROT HAD CONFERRED WITH JAPP IN A LOW TONE ON THE WAY UP AND IT WAS THE LATTER FUNCTIONARY WHO REQUESTED THAT THE HOUSEHOLD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SERVANTS SHOULD BE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER IN THE DRAWINGROOM I REALIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS IT WAS UP TO POIROT TO MAKE HIS BOAST GOOD PERSONALLY I WAS NOT SANGUINE POIROT MIGHT HAVE EXCELLENT REASONS FOR HIS BELIEF IN INGLETHORPS INNOCENCE BUT A MAN OF THE TYPE OF SUMMERHAYE WOULD REQUIRE TANGIBLE PROOFS AND THESE I DOUBTED IF POIROT COULD SUPPLY BEFORE VERY LONG WE HAD ALL TROOPED INTO THE DRAWINGROOM THE DOOR OF WHICH JAPP CLOSED POIROT POLITELY SET CHAIRS FOR EVERYONE THE SCOTLAND YARD MEN WERE THE CYNOSURE OF ALL EYES I THINK THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE REALIZED THAT THE THING WAS NOT A BAD DREAM BUT A TANGIBLE REALITY WE HAD READ OF SUCH THINGSNOW WE OURSELVES WERE ACTORS IN THE DRAMA TOMORROW THE DAILY PAPERS ALL OVER ENGLAND WOULD BLAZON OUT THE NEWS IN STARING HEADLINES MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX WEALTHY LADY POISONED THERE WOULD BE PICTURES OF STYLES SNAPSHOTS OF THE FAMILY LEAVING THE INQUESTTHE VILLAGE PHOTOGRAPHER HAD NOT BEEN IDLE ALL THE THINGS THAT ONE HAD READ A HUNDRED TIMESTHINGS THAT HAPPEN TO OTHER PEOPLE NOT TO ONESELF AND NOW IN THIS HOUSE A MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED IN FRONT OF US WERE THE DETECTIVES IN CHARGE OF THE CASE THE WELLKNOWN GLIB PHRASEOLOGY PASSED RAPIDLY THROUGH MY MIND IN THE INTERVAL BEFORE POIROT OPENED THE PROCEEDINGS I THINK EVERYONE WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT IT SHOULD BE HE AND NOT ONE OF THE OFFICIAL DETECTIVES WHO TOOK THE INITIATIVE MESDAMES AND MESSIEURS SAID POIROT BOWING AS THOUGH HE WERE A CELEBRITY ABOUT TO DELIVER A LECTURE I HAVE ASKED YOU TO COME HERE ALL TOGETHER FOR A CERTAIN OBJECT THAT OBJECT IT CONCERNS MR ALFRED INGLETHORP INGLETHORP WAS SITTING A LITTLE BY HIMSELFI THINK UNCONSCIOUSLY EVERYONE HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR SLIGHTLY AWAY FROM HIMAND HE GAVE A FAINT START AS POIROT PRONOUNCED HIS NAME MR INGLETHORP SAID POIROT ADDRESSING HIM DIRECTLY A VERY DARK SHADOW IS RESTING ON THIS HOUSETHE SHADOW OF MURDER INGLETHORP SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY MY POOR WIFE HE MURMURED POOR EMILY IT IS TERRIBLE I DO NOT THINK MONSIEUR SAID POIROT POINTEDLY THAT YOU QUITE REALIZE HOW TERRIBLE IT MAY BEFOR YOU AND AS INGLETHORP DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HE ADDED MR INGLETHORP YOU ARE STANDING IN VERY GRAVE DANGER THE TWO DETECTIVES FIDGETED I SAW THE OFFICIAL CAUTION ANYTHING YOU SAY WILL BE USED IN EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU ACTUALLY HOVERING ON SUMMERHAYES LIPS POIROT WENT ON DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW MONSIEUR NO WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN SAID POIROT DELIBERATELY THAT YOU ARE SUSPECTED OF POISONING YOUR WIFE A LITTLE GASP RAN ROUND THE CIRCLE AT THIS PLAIN SPEAKING GOOD HEAVENS CRIED INGLETHORP STARTING UP WHAT A MONSTROUS IDEA IPOISON MY DEAREST EMILY I DO NOT THINKPOIROT WATCHED HIM NARROWLYTHAT YOU QUITE REALIZE THE UNFAVOURABLE NATURE OF YOUR EVIDENCE AT THE INQUEST MR INGLETHORP KNOWING WHAT I HAVE NOW TOLD YOU DO YOU STILL REFUSE TO SAY WHERE YOU WERE AT SIX OCLOCK ON MONDAY AFTERNOON WITH A GROAN ALFRED INGLETHORP SANK DOWN AGAIN AND BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS POIROT APPROACHED AND STOOD OVER HIM SPEAK HE CRIED MENACINGLY WITH AN EFFORT INGLETHORP RAISED HIS FACE FROM HIS HANDS THEN SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY HE SHOOK HIS HEAD YOU WILL NOT SPEAK NO I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANYONE COULD BE SO MONSTROUS AS TO ACCUSE ME OF WHAT YOU SAY POIROT NODDED THOUGHTFULLY LIKE A MAN WHOSE MIND IS MADE UP SOIT HE SAID THEN I MUST SPEAK FOR YOU ALFRED INGLETHORP SPRANG UP AGAIN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK YOU DO NOT KNOW HE BROKE OFF ABRUPTLY POIROT TURNED TO FACE US MESDAMES AND MESSIEURS I SPEAK LISTEN I HERCULE POIROT AFFIRM THAT THE MAN WHO ENTERED THE CHEMISTS SHOP AND PURCHASED STRYCHNINE AT SIX OCLOCK ON MONDAY LAST WAS NOT MR INGLETHORP FOR AT SIX OCLOCK ON THAT DAY MR INGLETHORP WAS ESCORTING MRS RAIKES BACK TO HER HOME FROM A NEIGHBOURING FARM I CAN PRODUCE NO LESS THAN FIVE WITNESSES TO SWEAR TO HAVING SEEN THEM TOGETHER EITHER AT SIX OR JUST AFTER AND AS YOU MAY KNOW THE ABBEY FARM MRS RAIKESS HOME IS AT LEAST TWO AND A HALF MILES DISTANT FROM THE VILLAGE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION AS TO THE ALIBI CHAPTER VIII FRESH SUSPICIONS THERE WAS A MOMENTS STUPEFIED SILENCE JAPP WHO WAS THE LEAST SURPRISED OF ANY OF US WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK MY WORD HE CRIED YOURE THE GOODS AND NO MISTAKE MR POIROT THESE WITNESSES OF YOURS ARE ALL RIGHT I SUPPOSE VOIL I HAVE PREPARED A LIST OF THEMNAMES AND ADDRESSES YOU MUST SEE THEM OF COURSE BUT YOU WILL FIND IT ALL RIGHT IM SURE OF THAT JAPP LOWERED HIS VOICE IM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU A PRETTY MARES NEST ARRESTING HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN HE TURNED TO INGLETHORP BUT IF YOULL EXCUSE ME SIR WHY COULDNT YOU SAY ALL THIS AT THE INQUEST I WILL TELL YOU WHY INTERRUPTED POIROT THERE WAS A CERTAIN RUMOUR A MOST MALICIOUS AND UTTERLY UNTRUE ONE INTERRUPTED ALFRED INGLETHORP IN AN AGITATED VOICE AND MR INGLETHORP WAS ANXIOUS TO HAVE NO SCANDAL REVIVED JUST AT PRESENT AM I RIGHT QUITE RIGHT INGLETHORP NODDED WITH MY POOR EMILY NOT YET BURIED CAN YOU WONDER I WAS ANXIOUS THAT NO MORE LYING RUMOURS SHOULD BE STARTED BETWEEN YOU AND ME SIR REMARKED JAPP ID SOONER HAVE ANY AMOUNT OF RUMOURS THAN BE ARRESTED FOR MURDER AND I VENTURE TO THINK YOUR POOR LADY WOULD HAVE FELT THE SAME AND IF IT HADNT BEEN FOR MR POIROT

SCOTLAND YARD FELLOWS GONE DOWN TO INTERVIEW THE SERVANTS I SHOWED THEM ALL OUR EXHIBITS I AM DISAPPOINTED IN JAPP HE HAS NO METHOD HULLO I SAID LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW HERES DR BAUERSTEIN I BELIEVE YOURE RIGHT ABOUT THAT MAN POIROT I DONT LIKE HIM HE IS CLEVER OBSERVED POIROT MEDITATIVELY OH CLEVER AS THE DEVIL I MUST SAY I WAS OVERJOYED TO SEE HIM IN THE PLIGHT HE WAS IN ON TUESDAY YOU NEVER SAW SUCH A SPECTACLE AND I DESCRIBED THE DOCTORS ADVENTURE HE LOOKED A REGULAR SCARECROW PLASTERED WITH MUD FROM HEAD TO FOOT YOU SAW HIM THEN YES OF COURSE HE DIDNT WANT TO COME INIT WAS JUST AFTER DINNERBUT MR INGLETHORP INSISTED WHAT POIROT CAUGHT ME VIOLENTLY BY THE SHOULDERS WAS DR BAUERSTEIN HERE ON TUESDAY EVENING HERE AND YOU NEVER TOLD ME WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME WHY WHY HE APPEARED TO BE IN AN ABSOLUTE FRENZY MY DEAR POIROT I EXPOSTULATED I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD INTEREST YOU I DIDNT KNOW IT WAS OF ANY IMPORTANCE IMPORTANCE IT IS OF THE FIRST IMPORTANCE SO DR BAUERSTEIN WAS HERE ON TUESDAY NIGHTTHE NIGHT OF THE MURDER HASTINGS DO YOU NOT SEE THAT ALTERS EVERYTHINGEVERYTHING I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SO UPSET LOOSENING HIS HOLD OF ME HE MECHANICALLY STRAIGHTENED A PAIR OF CANDLESTICKS STILL MURMURING TO HIMSELF YES THAT ALTERS EVERYTHINGEVERYTHING SUDDENLY HE SEEMED TO COME TO A DECISION ALLONS HE SAID WE MUST ACT AT ONCE WHERE IS MR CAVENDISH JOHN WAS IN THE SMOKINGROOM POIROT WENT STRAIGHT TO HIM MR CAVENDISH I HAVE SOME IMPORTANT BUSINESS IN TADMINSTER A NEW CLUE MAY I TAKE YOUR MOTOR WHY OF COURSE DO YOU MEAN AT ONCE IF YOU PLEASE JOHN RANG THE BELL AND ORDERED ROUND THE CAR IN ANOTHER TEN MINUTES WE WERE RACING DOWN THE PARK AND ALONG THE HIGH ROAD TO TADMINSTER NOW POIROT I REMARKED RESIGNEDLY PERHAPS YOU WILL TELL ME WHAT ALL THIS IS ABOUT WELL MON AMI A GOOD DEAL YOU CAN GUESS FOR YOURSELF OF COURSE YOU REALIZE THAT NOW MR INGLETHORP IS OUT OF IT THE WHOLE POSITION IS GREATLY CHANGED WE ARE FACE TO FACE WITH AN ENTIRELY NEW PROBLEM WE KNOW NOW THAT THERE IS ONE PERSON WHO DID NOT BUY THE POISON WE HAVE CLEARED AWAY THE MANUFACTURED CLUES NOW FOR THE REAL ONES I HAVE ASCERTAINED THAT ANYONE IN THE HOUSEHOLD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MRS CAVENDISH WHO WAS PLAYING TENNIS WITH YOU COULD HAVE PERSONATED MR INGLETHORP ON MONDAY EVENING IN THE SAME WAY WE HAVE HIS STATEMENT THAT HE PUT THE COFFEE DOWN IN THE HALL NO ONE TOOK MUCH NOTICE OF THAT AT THE INQUESTBUT NOW IT HAS A VERY DIFFERENT SIGNIFICANCE WE MUST FIND OUT WHO DID TAKE THAT COFFEE TO MRS INGLETHORP EVENTUALLY OR WHO PASSED THROUGH THE HALL WHILST IT WAS STANDING THERE FROM YOUR ACCOUNT THERE ARE ONLY TWO PEOPLE WHOM WE CAN POSITIVELY SAY DID NOT GO NEAR THE COFFEEMRS CAVENDISH AND MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA YES THAT IS SO I FELT AN INEXPRESSIBLE LIGHTENING OF THE HEART MARY CAVENDISH COULD CERTAINLY NOT REST UNDER SUSPICION IN CLEARING ALFRED INGLETHORP CONTINUED POIROT I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SHOW MY HAND SOONER THAN I INTENDED AS LONG AS I MIGHT BE THOUGHT TO BE PURSUING HIM THE CRIMINAL WOULD BE OFF HIS GUARD NOW HE WILL BE DOUBLY CAREFUL YESDOUBLY CAREFUL HE TURNED TO ME ABRUPTLY TELL ME HASTINGS YOU YOURSELFHAVE YOU NO SUSPICIONS OF ANYBODY I HESITATED TO TELL THE TRUTH AN IDEA WILD AND EXTRAVAGANT IN ITSELF HAD ONCE OR TWICE THAT MORNING FLASHED THROUGH MY BRAIN I HAD REJECTED IT AS ABSURD NEVERTHELESS IT PERSISTED YOU COULDNT CALL IT A SUSPICION I MURMURED ITS SO UTTERLY FOOLISH COME NOW URGED POIROT ENCOURAGINGLY DO NOT FEAR SPEAK YOUR MIND YOU SHOULD ALWAYS PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR INSTINCTS WELL THEN I BLURTED OUT ITS ABSURDBUT I SUSPECT MISS HOWARD OF NOT TELLING ALL SHE KNOWS MISS HOWARD YESYOULL LAUGH AT ME NOT AT ALL WHY SHOULD I I CANT HELP FEELING I CONTINUED BLUNDERINGLY THAT WEVE RATHER LEFT HER OUT OF THE POSSIBLE SUSPECTS SIMPLY ON THE STRENGTH OF HER HAVING BEEN AWAY FROM THE PLACE BUT AFTER ALL SHE WAS ONLY FIFTEEN MILES AWAY A CAR WOULD DO IT IN HALF AN HOUR CAN WE SAY POSITIVELY THAT SHE WAS AWAY FROM STYLES ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER YES MY FRIEND SAID POIROT UNEXPECTEDLY WE CAN ONE OF MY FIRST ACTIONS WAS TO RING UP THE HOSPITAL WHERE SHE WAS WORKING WELL WELL I LEARNT THAT MISS HOWARD HAD BEEN ON AFTERNOON DUTY ON TUESDAY AND THATA CONVOY COMING IN UNEXPECTEDLYSHE HAD KINDLY OFFERED TO REMAIN ON NIGHT DUTY WHICH OFFER WAS GRATEFULLY ACCEPTED THAT DISPOSES OF THAT OH I SAID RATHER NONPLUSSED REALLY I CONTINUED ITS HER EXTRAORDINARY VEHEMENCE AGAINST INGLETHORP THAT STARTED ME OFF SUSPECTING HER I CANT HELP FEELING SHED DO ANYTHING AGAINST HIM AND I HAD AN IDEA SHE MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE DESTROYING OF THE WILL SHE MIGHT HAVE BURNT THE NEW ONE MISTAKING IT FOR THE EARLIER ONE IN HIS FAVOUR SHE IS SO TERRIBLY BITTER AGAINST HIM YOU CONSIDER HER VEHEMENCE UNNATURAL YES SHE IS SO VERY VIOLENT I WONDERED REALLY WHETHER SHE IS QUITE SANE ON THAT POINT POIROT SHOOK HIS HEAD ENERGETICALLY NO NO YOU ARE ON A WRONG TACK THERE THERE IS NOTHING WEAKMINDED OR DEGENERATE ABOUT MISS HOWARD SHE IS AN EXCELLENT SPECIMEN OF WELLBALANCED ENGLISH BEEF AND BRAWN SHE IS SANITY ITSELF YET HER HATRED OF INGLETHORP SEEMS ALMOST A MANIA MY IDEA WASA VERY RIDICULOUS ONE NO DOUBTTHAT SHE HAD INTENDED TO POISON HIMAND THAT IN SOME WAY MRS INGLETHORP GOT HOLD OF IT BY MISTAKE BUT I DONT AT ALL SEE HOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE THE WHOLE THING IS ABSURD AND RIDICULOUS TO THE LAST DEGREE STILL YOU ARE RIGHT IN ONE THING IT IS ALWAYS WISE TO SUSPECT EVERYBODY UNTIL YOU CAN PROVE LOGICALLY AND TO YOUR OWN SATISFACTION THAT THEY ARE INNOCENT NOW WHAT REASONS ARE THERE AGAINST MISS HOWARDS HAVING DELIBERATELY POISONED MRS INGLETHORP WHY SHE WAS DEVOTED TO HER I EXCLAIMED TCHA TCHA CRIED POIROT IRRITABLY YOU ARGUE LIKE A CHILD IF MISS HOWARD WERE CAPABLE OF POISONING THE OLD LADY SHE WOULD BE QUITE EQUALLY CAPABLE OF SIMULATING DEVOTION NO WE MUST LOOK ELSEWHERE YOU ARE PERFECTLY CORRECT IN YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT HER VEHEMENCE AGAINST ALFRED INGLETHORP IS TOO VIOLENT TO BE NATURAL BUT YOU ARE QUITE WRONG IN THE DEDUCTION YOU DRAW FROM IT I HAVE DRAWN MY OWN DEDUCTIONS WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE CORRECT BUT I WILL NOT SPEAK OF THEM AT PRESENT HE PAUSED A MINUTE THEN WENT ON NOW TO MY WAY OF THINKING THERE IS ONE INSUPERABLE OBJECTION TO MISS HOWARDS BEING THE MURDERESS AND THAT IS THAT IN NO POSSIBLE WAY COULD MRS INGLETHORPS DEATH BENEFIT MISS HOWARD NOW THERE IS NO MURDER WITHOUT A MOTIVE I REFLECTED COULD NOT MRS INGLETHORP HAVE MADE A WILL IN HER FAVOUR POIROT SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT YOU YOURSELF SUGGESTED THAT POSSIBILITY TO MR WELLS POIROT SMILED THAT WAS FOR A REASON I DID NOT WANT TO MENTION THE NAME OF THE PERSON WHO WAS ACTUALLY IN MY MIND MISS HOWARD OCCUPIED VERY MUCH THE SAME POSITION SO I USED HER NAME INSTEAD STILL MRS INGLETHORP MIGHT HAVE DONE SO WHY THAT WILL MADE ON THE AFTERNOON OF HER DEATH MAY BUT POIROTS SHAKE OF THE HEAD WAS SO ENERGETIC THAT I STOPPED NO MY FRIEND I HAVE CERTAIN LITTLE IDEAS OF MY OWN ABOUT THAT WILL BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS MUCHIT WAS NOT IN MISS HOWARDS FAVOUR I ACCEPTED HIS ASSURANCE THOUGH I DID NOT REALLY SEE HOW HE COULD BE SO POSITIVE ABOUT THE MATTER WELL I SAID WITH A SIGH WE WILL ACQUIT MISS HOWARD THEN IT IS PARTLY YOUR FAULT THAT I EVER CAME TO SUSPECT HER IT WAS WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT HER EVIDENCE AT THE INQUEST THAT SET ME OFF POIROT LOOKED PUZZLED WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT HER EVIDENCE AT THE INQUEST DONT YOU REMEMBER WHEN I CITED HER AND JOHN CAVENDISH AS BEING ABOVE SUSPICION OHAHYES HE SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED BUT RECOVERED HIMSELF BY THE WAY HASTINGS THERE IS SOMETHING I WANT YOU TO DO FOR ME CERTAINLY WHAT IS IT NEXT TIME YOU HAPPEN TO BE ALONE WITH LAWRENCE CAVENDISH I WANT YOU TO SAY THIS TO HIM I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU FROM POIROT HE SAYS FIND THE EXTRA COFFEECUP AND YOU CAN REST IN PEACE NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS FIND THE EXTRA COFFEECUP AND YOU CAN REST IN PEACE IS THAT RIGHT I ASKED MUCH MYSTIFIED EXCELLENT BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN AH THAT I WILL LEAVE YOU TO FIND OUT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE FACTS JUST SAY THAT TO HIM AND SEE WHAT HE SAYS VERY WELLBUT ITS ALL EXTREMELY MYSTERIOUS WE WERE RUNNING INTO TADMINSTER NOW AND POIROT DIRECTED THE CAR TO THE ANALYTICAL CHEMIST POIROT HOPPED DOWN BRISKLY AND WENT INSIDE IN A FEW MINUTES HE WAS BACK AGAIN THERE HE SAID THAT IS ALL MY BUSINESS WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE I ASKED IN LIVELY CURIOSITY I LEFT SOMETHING TO BE ANALYSED YES BUT WHAT THE SAMPLE OF COCOA I TOOK FROM THE SAUCEPAN IN THE BEDROOM BUT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TESTED I CRIED STUPEFIED DR BAUERSTEIN HAD IT TESTED AND YOU YOURSELF LAUGHED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THERE BEING STRYCHNINE IN IT I KNOW DR BAUERSTEIN HAD IT TESTED REPLIED POIROT QUIETLY WELL THEN WELL I HAVE A FANCY FOR HAVING IT ANALYSED AGAIN THAT IS ALL AND NOT ANOTHER WORD ON THE SUBJECT COULD I DRAG OUT OF HIM THIS PROCEEDING OF POIROTS IN RESPECT OF THE COCOA PUZZLED ME INTENSELY I COULD SEE NEITHER RHYME NOR REASON IN IT HOWEVER MY CONFIDENCE IN HIM WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD RATHER WANED WAS FULLY RESTORED SINCE HIS BELIEF IN ALFRED INGLETHORPS INNOCENCE HAD BEEN SO TRIUMPHANTLY VINDICATED THE FUNERAL OF MRS INGLETHORP TOOK PLACE THE FOLLOWING DAY AND ON MONDAY AS I CAME DOWN TO A LATE BREAKFAST JOHN DREW ME ASIDE AND INFORMED ME THAT MR INGLETHORP WAS LEAVING THAT MORNING TO TAKE UP HIS QUARTERS AT THE STYLITES ARMS UNTIL HE SHOULD HAVE COMPLETED HIS PLANS AND REALLY ITS A GREAT RELIEF TO THINK HES GOING HASTINGS CONTINUED MY HONEST FRIEND IT WAS BAD ENOUGH BEFORE WHEN WE THOUGHT HED DONE IT BUT IM HANGED IF IT ISNT WORSE NOW WHEN WE ALL FEEL GUILTY FOR HAVING BEEN SO DOWN ON THE FELLOW THE FACT IS WEVE TREATED HIM ABOMINABLY OF COURSE THINGS DID LOOK BLACK AGAINST HIM I DONT SEE HOW ANYONE COULD BLAME US FOR JUMPING TO THE CONCLUSIONS WE DID STILL THERE IT IS WE WERE IN THE WRONG AND NOW THERES A BEASTLY FEELING THAT ONE OUGHT TO MAKE AMENDS WHICH IS DIFFICULT WHEN ONE DOESNT LIKE THE FELLOW A BIT BETTER THAN ONE DID BEFORE THE WHOLE THINGS DAMNED AWKWARD AND IM THANKFUL HES HAD THE TACT TO TAKE HIMSELF OFF ITS A GOOD THING STYLES WASNT THE MATERS TO LEAVE TO HIM COULDNT BEAR TO THINK OF THE FELLOW LORDING IT HERE HES WELCOME TO HER MONEY YOULL BE ABLE TO KEEP UP THE PLACE ALL RIGHT I ASKED OH YES THERE ARE THE DEATH DUTIES OF COURSE BUT HALF MY FATHERS MONEY GOES WITH THE PLACE AND LAWRENCE WILL STAY WITH US FOR THE PRESENT SO THERE IS HIS SHARE AS WELL WE SHALL BE PINCHED AT FIRST OF COURSE BECAUSE AS I ONCE TOLD YOU I AM IN A BIT OF A HOLE FINANCIALLY MYSELF STILL THE JOHNNIES WILL WAIT NOW IN THE GENERAL RELIEF AT INGLETHORPS APPROACHING DEPARTURE WE HAD THE MOST GENIAL BREAKFAST WE HAD EXPERIENCED SINCE THE TRAGEDY CYNTHIA WHOSE YOUNG SPIRITS WERE NATURALLY BUOYANT WAS LOOKING QUITE HER PRETTY SELF AGAIN AND WE ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LAWRENCE WHO SEEMED

BLAST OF PUBLICITY THE SCOTLAND YARD MEN CAME AND WENT EXAMINING QUESTIONING LYNXEYED AND RESERVED OF TONGUE TOWARDS WHAT END THEY WERE WORKING WE DID NOT KNOW HAD THEY ANY CLUE OR WOULD THE WHOLE

TO US THEY ARE KEPT LOCKED UP IN A LITTLE CUPBOARD I BELIEVE THEY HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THEY ALWAYS TAKE OUT THE KEY BEFORE LEAVING THE ROOM INDEED IT IS NEAR THE WINDOW THIS CUPBOARD NO RIGHT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHY POIROT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I WONDERED THAT IS ALL WILL YOU COME IN WE HAD REACHED THE COTTAGE NO I THINK ILL BE GETTING BACK I SHALL GO ROUND THE LONG WAY THROUGH THE WOODS THE WOODS ROUND STYLES WERE VERY BEAUTIFUL AFTER THE WALK ACROSS THE OPEN PARK IT WAS PLEASANT TO SAUNTER LAZILY THROUGH THE COOL GLADES THERE WAS HARDLY A BREATH OF WIND THE VERY CHIRP OF THE BIRDS WAS FAINT AND SUBDUED I STROLLED ON A LITTLE WAY AND FINALLY FLUNG MYSELF DOWN AT THE FOOT OF A GRAND OLD BEECHTREE MY THOUGHTS OF MANKIND WERE KINDLY AND CHARITABLE I EVEN FORGAVE POIROT FOR HIS ABSURD SECRECY IN FACT I WAS AT PEACE WITH THE WORLD THEN I YAWNED I THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRIME AND IT STRUCK ME AS BEING VERY UNREAL AND FAR OFF I YAWNED AGAIN PROBABLY I THOUGHT IT REALLY NEVER HAPPENED OF COURSE IT WAS ALL A BAD DREAM THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT IT WAS LAWRENCE WHO HAD MURDERED ALFRED INGLETHORP WITH A CROQUET MALLET BUT IT WAS ABSURD OF JOHN TO MAKE SUCH A FUSS ABOUT IT AND TO GO SHOUTING OUT I TELL YOU I WONT HAVE IT I WOKE UP WITH A START AT ONCE I REALIZED THAT I WAS IN A VERY AWKWARD PREDICAMENT FOR ABOUT TWELVE FEET AWAY FROM ME JOHN AND MARY CAVENDISH WERE STANDING FACING EACH OTHER AND THEY WERE EVIDENTLY QUARRELLING AND QUITE AS EVIDENTLY THEY WERE UNAWARE OF MY VICINITY FOR BEFORE I COULD MOVE OR SPEAK JOHN REPEATED THE WORDS WHICH HAD AROUSED ME FROM MY DREAM I TELL YOU MARY I WONT HAVE IT MARYS VOICE CAME COOL AND LIQUID HAVE YOU ANY RIGHT TO CRITICIZE MY ACTIONS IT WILL BE THE TALK OF THE VILLAGE MY MOTHER WAS ONLY BURIED ON SATURDAY AND HERE YOU ARE GADDING ABOUT WITH THE FELLOW OH SHE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS IF IT IS ONLY VILLAGE GOSSIP THAT YOU MIND BUT IT ISNT IVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE FELLOW HANGING ABOUT HES A POLISH JEW ANYWAY A TINGE OF JEWISH BLOOD IS NOT A BAD THING IT LEAVENS THESHE LOOKED AT HIMSTOLID STUPIDITY OF THE ORDINARY ENGLISHMAN FIRE IN HER EYES ICE IN HER VOICE I DID NOT WONDER THAT THE BLOOD ROSE TO JOHNS FACE IN A CRIMSON TIDE MARY WELL HER TONE DID NOT CHANGE THE PLEADING DIED OUT OF HIS VOICE AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO SEE BAUERSTEIN AGAINST MY EXPRESS WISHES IF I CHOOSE YOU DEFY ME NO BUT I DENY YOUR RIGHT TO CRITICIZE MY ACTIONS HAVE YOU NO FRIENDS OF WHOM I SHOULD DISAPPROVE JOHN FELL BACK A PACE THE COLOUR EBBED SLOWLY FROM HIS FACE WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SAID IN AN UNSTEADY VOICE YOU SEE SAID MARY QUIETLY YOU DO SEE DONT YOU THAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DICTATE TO ME AS TO THE CHOICE OF MY FRIENDS JOHN GLANCED AT HER PLEADINGLY A STRICKEN LOOK ON HIS FACE NO RIGHT HAVE I NO RIGHT MARY HE SAID UNSTEADILY HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS MARY FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT SHE WAVERED A SOFTER EXPRESSION CAME OVER HER FACE THEN SUDDENLY SHE TURNED ALMOST FIERCELY AWAY NONE SHE WAS WALKING AWAY WHEN JOHN SPRANG AFTER HER AND CAUGHT HER BY THE ARM MARYHIS VOICE WAS VERY QUIET NOWARE YOU IN LOVE WITH THIS FELLOW BAUERSTEIN SHE HESITATED AND SUDDENLY THERE SWEPT ACROSS HER FACE A STRANGE EXPRESSION OLD AS THE HILLS YET WITH SOMETHING ETERNALLY YOUNG ABOUT IT SO MIGHT SOME EGYPTIAN SPHINX HAVE SMILED SHE FREED HERSELF QUIETLY FROM HIS ARM AND SPOKE OVER HER SHOULDER PERHAPS SHE SAID AND THEN SWIFTLY PASSED OUT OF THE LITTLE GLADE LEAVING JOHN STANDING THERE AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN TURNED TO STONE RATHER OSTENTATIOUSLY I STEPPED FORWARD CRACKLING SOME DEAD BRANCHES WITH MY FEET AS I DID SO JOHN TURNED LUCKILY HE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT I HAD ONLY JUST COME UPON THE SCENE HULLO HASTINGS HAVE YOU SEEN THE LITTLE FELLOW SAFELY BACK TO HIS COTTAGE QUAINT LITTLE CHAP IS HE ANY GOOD THOUGH REALLY HE WAS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE FINEST DETECTIVES OF HIS DAY OH WELL I SUPPOSE THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN IT THEN WHAT A ROTTEN WORLD IT IS THOUGH YOU FIND IT SO I ASKED GOOD LORD YES THERES THIS TERRIBLE BUSINESS TO START WITH SCOTLAND YARD MEN IN AND OUT OF THE HOUSE LIKE A JACKINTHEBOX NEVER KNOW WHERE THEY WONT TURN UP NEXT SCREAMING HEADLINES IN EVERY PAPER IN THE COUNTRYDAMN ALL JOURNALISTS I SAY DO YOU KNOW THERE WAS A WHOLE CROWD STARING IN AT THE LODGE GATES THIS MORNING SORT OF MADAME TUSSAUDS CHAMBER OF HORRORS BUSINESS THAT CAN BE SEEN FOR NOTHING PRETTY THICK ISNT IT CHEER UP JOHN I SAID SOOTHINGLY IT CANT LAST FOR EVER CANT IT THOUGH IT CAN LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR US NEVER TO BE ABLE TO HOLD UP OUR HEADS AGAIN NO NO YOURE GETTING MORBID ON THE SUBJECT ENOUGH TO MAKE A MAN MORBID TO BE STALKED BY BEASTLY JOURNALISTS AND STARED AT BY GAPING MOONFACED IDIOTS WHEREVER HE GOES BUT THERES WORSE THAN THAT WHAT JOHN LOWERED HIS VOICE HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT HASTINGSITS A NIGHTMARE TO MEWHO DID IT I CANT HELP FEELING SOMETIMES IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT BECAUSEBECAUSEWHO COULD HAVE DONE IT NOW INGLETHORPS OUT OF THE WAY THERES NO ONE ELSE NO ONE I MEAN EXCEPTONE OF US YES INDEED THAT WAS NIGHTMARE ENOUGH FOR ANY MAN ONE OF US YES SURELY IT MUST BE SO UNLESS A NEW IDEA SUGGESTED ITSELF TO MY MIND RAPIDLY I CONSIDERED IT THE LIGHT INCREASED POIROTS MYSTERIOUS DOINGS HIS HINTSTHEY ALL FITTED IN FOOL THAT I WAS NOT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS POSSIBILITY BEFORE AND WHAT A RELIEF FOR US ALL NO JOHN I SAID IT ISNT ONE OF US HOW COULD IT BE I KNOW BUT STILL WHO ELSE IS THERE CANT YOU GUESS NO I LOOKED CAUTIOUSLY ROUND AND LOWERED MY VOICE DR BAUERSTEIN I WHISPERED IMPOSSIBLE NOT AT ALL BUT WHAT EARTHLY INTEREST COULD HE HAVE IN MY MOTHERS DEATH THAT I DONT SEE I CONFESSED BUT ILL TELL YOU THIS POIROT THINKS SO POIROT DOES HE HOW DO YOU KNOW I TOLD HIM OF POIROTS INTENSE EXCITEMENT ON HEARING THAT DR BAUERSTEIN HAD BEEN AT STYLES ON THE FATAL NIGHT AND ADDED HE SAID TWICE THAT ALTERS EVERYTHING AND IVE BEEN THINKING YOU KNOW INGLETHORP SAID HE HAD PUT DOWN THE COFFEE IN THE HALL WELL IT WAS JUST THEN THAT BAUERSTEIN ARRIVED ISNT IT POSSIBLE THAT AS INGLETHORP BROUGHT HIM THROUGH THE HALL THE DOCTOR DROPPED SOMETHING INTO THE COFFEE IN PASSING HM SAID JOHN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY RISKY YES BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE AND THEN HOW COULD HE KNOW IT WAS HER COFFEE NO OLD FELLOW I DONT THINK THAT WILL WASH BUT I HAD REMEMBERED SOMETHING ELSE YOURE QUITE RIGHT THAT WASNT HOW IT WAS DONE LISTEN AND I THEN TOLD HIM OF THE COCOA SAMPLE WHICH POIROT HAD TAKEN TO BE ANALYSED JOHN INTERRUPTED JUST AS I HAD DONE BUT LOOK HERE BAUERSTEIN HAD HAD IT ANALYSED ALREADY YES YES THATS THE POINT I DIDNT SEE IT EITHER UNTIL NOW DONT YOU UNDERSTAND BAUERSTEIN HAD IT ANALYSEDTHATS JUST IT IF BAUERSTEINS THE MURDERER NOTHING COULD BE SIMPLER THAN FOR HIM TO SUBSTITUTE SOME ORDINARY COCOA FOR HIS SAMPLE AND SEND THAT TO BE TESTED AND OF COURSE THEY WOULD FIND NO STRYCHNINE BUT NO ONE WOULD DREAM OF SUSPECTING BAUERSTEIN OR THINK OF TAKING ANOTHER SAMPLEEXCEPT POIROT I ADDED WITH BELATED RECOGNITION YES BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BITTER TASTE THAT COCOA WONT DISGUISE WELL WEVE ONLY HIS WORD FOR THAT AND THERE ARE OTHER POSSIBILITIES HES ADMITTEDLY ONE OF THE WORLDS GREATEST TOXICOLOGISTS ONE OF THE WORLDS GREATEST WHAT SAY IT AGAIN HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT POISONS THAN ALMOST ANYBODY I EXPLAINED WELL MY IDEA IS THAT PERHAPS HES FOUND SOME WAY OF MAKING STRYCHNINE TASTELESS OR IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN STRYCHNINE AT ALL BUT SOME OBSCURE DRUG NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD OF WHICH PRODUCES MUCH THE SAME SYMPTOMS HM YES THAT MIGHT BE SAID JOHN BUT LOOK HERE HOW COULD HE HAVE GOT AT THE COCOA THAT WASNT DOWNSTAIRS NO IT WASNT I ADMITTED RELUCTANTLY AND THEN SUDDENLY A DREADFUL POSSIBILITY FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND I HOPED AND PRAYED IT WOULD NOT OCCUR TO JOHN ALSO I GLANCED SIDEWAYS AT HIM HE WAS FROWNING PERPLEXEDLY AND I DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF FOR THE TERRIBLE THOUGHT THAT HAD FLASHED ACROSS MY MIND WAS THIS THAT DR BAUERSTEIN MIGHT HAVE HAD AN ACCOMPLICE YET SURELY IT COULD NOT BE SURELY NO WOMAN AS BEAUTIFUL AS MARY CAVENDISH COULD BE A MURDERESS YET BEAUTIFUL WOMEN HAD BEEN KNOWN TO POISON AND SUDDENLY I REMEMBERED THAT FIRST CONVERSATION AT TEA ON THE DAY OF MY ARRIVAL AND THE GLEAM IN HER EYES AS SHE HAD SAID THAT POISON WAS A WOMANS WEAPON HOW AGITATED SHE HAD BEEN ON THAT FATAL TUESDAY EVENING HAD MRS INGLETHORP DISCOVERED SOMETHING BETWEEN HER AND BAUERSTEIN AND THREATENED TO TELL HER HUSBAND WAS IT TO STOP THAT DENUNCIATION THAT THE CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED THEN I REMEMBERED THAT ENIGMATICAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN POIROT AND EVELYN HOWARD WAS THIS WHAT THEY HAD MEANT WAS THIS THE MONSTROUS POSSIBILITY THAT EVELYN HAD TRIED NOT TO BELIEVE YES IT ALL FITTED IN NO WONDER MISS HOWARD HAD SUGGESTED HUSHING IT UP NOW I UNDERSTOOD THAT UNFINISHED SENTENCE OF HERS EMILY HERSELF AND IN MY HEART I AGREED WITH HER WOULD NOT MRS INGLETHORP HAVE PREFERRED TO GO UNAVENGED RATHER THAN HAVE SUCH TERRIBLE DISHONOUR FALL UPON THE NAME OF CAVENDISH THERES ANOTHER THING SAID JOHN SUDDENLY AND THE UNEXPECTED SOUND OF HIS VOICE MADE ME START GUILTILY SOMETHING WHICH MAKES ME DOUBT IF WHAT YOU SAY CAN BE TRUE WHATS THAT I ASKED THANKFUL THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY FROM THE SUBJECT OF HOW THE POISON COULD HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE COCOA WHY THE FACT THAT BAUERSTEIN DEMANDED A POSTMORTEM HE NEEDNT HAVE DONE SO LITTLE WILKINS WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE CONTENT TO LET IT GO AT HEART DISEASE YES I SAID DOUBTFULLY BUT WE DONT KNOW PERHAPS HE THOUGHT IT SAFER IN THE LONG RUN SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE TALKED AFTERWARDS THEN THE HOME OFFICE MIGHT HAVE ORDERED EXHUMATION THE WHOLE THING WOULD HAVE COME OUT THEN AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AN AWKWARD POSITION FOR NO ONE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT A MAN OF HIS REPUTATION COULD HAVE BEEN DECEIVED INTO CALLING IT HEART DISEASE YES THATS POSSIBLE ADMITTED JOHN STILL HE ADDED IM BLEST IF I CAN SEE WHAT HIS MOTIVE COULD HAVE BEEN I TREMBLED LOOK HERE I SAID I MAY BE ALTOGETHER WRONG AND REMEMBER ALL THIS IS IN CONFIDENCE OH OF COURSETHAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING WE HAD WALKED AS WE TALKED AND NOW WE PASSED THROUGH THE LITTLE GATE INTO THE GARDEN VOICES ROSE NEAR AT HAND FOR TEA WAS SPREAD OUT UNDER THE SYCAMORETREE AS IT HAD BEEN ON THE DAY OF MY ARRIVAL CYNTHIA WAS BACK FROM THE HOSPITAL AND I PLACED MY CHAIR BESIDE HER AND TOLD HER OF POIROTS WISH TO VISIT THE DISPENSARY OF COURSE ID LOVE HIM TO SEE IT HED BETTER COME TO TEA THERE ONE DAY I MUST FIX IT UP WITH HIM HES SUCH A DEAR LITTLE MAN BUT HE IS FUNNY HE MADE ME TAKE THE BROOCH OUT OF MY TIE THE OTHER DAY AND PUT IT IN AGAIN BECAUSE HE SAID IT WASNT STRAIGHT I LAUGHED ITS QUITE A MANIA WITH HIM YES ISNT IT WE WERE SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO AND THEN GLANCING IN THE DIRECTION OF MARY CAVENDISH AND DROPPING HER VOICE CYNTHIA SAID MR HASTINGS YES AFTER TEA I WANT TO TALK TO YOU HER GLANCE AT MARY HAD SET ME THINKING I FANCIED THAT BETWEEN THESE TWO THERE EXISTED VERY LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR THE FIRST TIME IT OCCURRED TO ME TO WONDER ABOUT THE GIRLS FUTURE MRS INGLETHORP HAD MADE NO PROVISIONS OF ANY KIND FOR HER BUT I IMAGINED THAT JOHN AND MARY WOULD PROBABLY INSIST ON HER MAKING HER HOME WITH THEMAT ANY RATE UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR JOHN I KNEW WAS VERY FOND OF HER AND WOULD BE SORRY TO LET HER GO JOHN WHO HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE NOW REAPPEARED HIS GOODNATURED FACE WORE AN UNACCUSTOMED FROWN OF ANGER CONFOUND THOSE DETECTIVES I CANT THINK WHAT THEYRE AFTER THEYVE BEEN IN EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSETURNING THINGS INSIDE OUT AND UPSIDE DOWN IT REALLY IS TOO BAD I SUPPOSE THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF OUR ALL BEING OUT I SHALL GO FOR THAT FELLOW JAPP WHEN I NEXT SEE HIM LOT OF PAUL PRYS GRUNTED MISS HOWARD LAWRENCE OPINED THAT THEY HAD TO MAKE A SHOW OF DOING SOMETHING MARY CAVENDISH SAID NOTHING AFTER TEA I INVITED CYNTHIA TO COME FOR A WALK AND WE SAUNTERED OFF INTO THE WOODS TOGETHER WELL I INQUIRED AS SOON AS WE WERE PROTECTED FROM PRYING EYES BY THE LEAFY SCREEN WITH A SIGH CYNTHIA FLUNG HERSELF DOWN AND TOSSED OFF HER HAT THE SUNLIGHT PIERCING THROUGH THE BRANCHES TURNED THE AUBURN OF HER HAIR TO QUIVERING GOLD MR HASTINGSYOU ARE ALWAYS SO KIND AND YOU KNOW SUCH A LOT IT STRUCK ME AT THIS MOMENT THAT CYNTHIA WAS REALLY A VERY CHARMING GIRL MUCH MORE CHARMING THAN MARY WHO NEVER SAID THINGS OF THAT KIND WELL I ASKED BENIGNANTLY AS SHE HESITATED I WANT TO ASK YOUR ADVICE WHAT SHALL I DO DO YES YOU SEE AUNT EMILY ALWAYS TOLD ME I SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR I SUPPOSE SHE FORGOT OR DIDNT THINK SHE WAS LIKELY TO DIEANYWAY I AM NOT PROVIDED FOR AND I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO DO YOU THINK I OUGHT TO GO AWAY FROM HERE AT ONCE GOOD HEAVENS NO THEY DONT WANT TO PART WITH YOU IM SURE CYNTHIA HESITATED A MOMENT PLUCKING UP THE GRASS WITH HER TINY HANDS THEN SHE SAID MRS CAVENDISH DOES SHE HATES ME HATES YOU I CRIED ASTONISHED CYNTHIA NODDED YES I DONT KNOW WHY BUT SHE CANT BEAR ME AND HE CANT EITHER THERE I KNOW YOURE WRONG I SAID WARMLY ON THE CONTRARY JOHN IS VERY FOND OF YOU OH YESJOHN I MEANT LAWRENCE NOT OF COURSE THAT I CARE WHETHER LAWRENCE HATES ME OR NOT STILL ITS RATHER HORRID WHEN NO ONE LOVES YOU ISNT IT BUT THEY DO CYNTHIA DEAR I SAID EARNESTLY IM SURE YOU ARE MISTAKEN LOOK THERE IS JOHNAND MISS HOWARD CYNTHIA NODDED RATHER GLOOMILY YES JOHN LIKES ME I THINK AND OF COURSE EVIE

SHE DOESNT WANT ME ANDANDI DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO SUDDENLY THE POOR CHILD BURST OUT CRYING I DONT KNOW WHAT POSSESSED ME HER BEAUTY PERHAPS AS SHE SAT THERE WITH THE SUNLIGHT GLINTING DOWN ON HER HEAD PERHAPS THE SENSE OF RELIEF AT ENCOUNTERING SOMEONE WHO SO OBVIOUSLY COULD HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH THE TRAGEDY PERHAPS HONEST PITY FOR HER YOUTH AND LONELINESS ANYWAY I LEANT FORWARD AND TAKING HER LITTLE HAND I SAID AWKWARDLY MARRY ME CYNTHIA UNWITTINGLY I HAD HIT UPON A SOVEREIGN REMEDY FOR HER TEARS SHE SAT UP AT ONCE DREW HER HAND AWAY AND SAID WITH SOME ASPERITY DONT BE SILLY I WAS A LITTLE ANNOYED IM NOT BEING SILLY I AM ASKING YOU TO DO ME THE HONOUR OF BECOMING MY WIFE TO MY INTENSE SURPRISE CYNTHIA BURST OUT LAUGHING AND CALLED ME A FUNNY DEAR ITS PERFECTLY SWEET OF YOU SHE SAID BUT YOU KNOW YOU DONT WANT TO YES I DO IVE GOT NEVER MIND WHAT YOUVE GOT YOU DONT REALLY WANT TOAND I DONT EITHER WELL OF COURSE THAT SETTLES IT I SAID STIFFLY BUT I DONT SEE ANYTHING TO LAUGH AT THERES NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT A PROPOSAL NO INDEED SAID CYNTHIA SOMEBODY MIGHT ACCEPT YOU NEXT TIME GOODBYE YOUVE CHEERED ME UP VERY MUCH AND WITH A FINAL UNCONTROLLABLE BURST OF MERRIMENT SHE VANISHED THROUGH THE TREES THINKING OVER THE INTERVIEW IT STRUCK ME AS BEING PROFOUNDLY UNSATISFACTORY IT OCCURRED TO ME SUDDENLY THAT I WOULD GO DOWN TO THE VILLAGE AND LOOK UP BAUERSTEIN SOMEBODY OUGHT TO BE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE FELLOW AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE WISE TO ALLAY ANY SUSPICIONS HE MIGHT HAVE AS TO HIS BEING SUSPECTED I REMEMBERED HOW POIROT HAD RELIED ON MY DIPLOMACY ACCORDINGLY I WENT TO THE LITTLE HOUSE WITH THE APARTMENTS CARD INSERTED IN THE WINDOW WHERE I KNEW HE LODGED AND TAPPED ON THE DOOR AN OLD WOMAN CAME AND OPENED IT GOOD AFTERNOON I SAID PLEASANTLY IS DR BAUERSTEIN IN SHE STARED AT ME HAVENT YOU HEARD HEARD WHAT ABOUT HIM WHAT ABOUT HIM HES TOOK TOOK DEAD NO TOOK BY THE PERLICE BY THE POLICE I GASPED DO YOU MEAN THEYVE ARRESTED HIM YES THATS IT AND I WAITED TO HEAR NO MORE BUT TORE UP THE VILLAGE TO FIND POIROT CHAPTER X THE ARREST TO MY EXTREME ANNOYANCE POIROT WAS NOT IN AND THE OLD BELGIAN WHO ANSWERED MY KNOCK INFORMED ME THAT HE BELIEVED HE HAD GONE TO LONDON I WAS DUMBFOUNDED WHAT ON EARTH COULD POIROT BE DOING IN LONDON WAS IT A SUDDEN DECISION ON HIS PART OR HAD HE ALREADY MADE UP HIS MIND WHEN HE PARTED FROM ME A FEW HOURS EARLIER I RETRACED MY STEPS TO STYLES IN SOME ANNOYANCE WITH POIROT AWAY I WAS UNCERTAIN HOW TO ACT HAD HE FORESEEN THIS ARREST HAD HE NOT IN ALL PROBABILITY BEEN THE CAUSE OF IT THOSE QUESTIONS I COULD NOT RESOLVE BUT IN THE MEANTIME WHAT WAS I TO DO SHOULD I ANNOUNCE THE ARREST OPENLY AT STYLES OR NOT THOUGH I DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IT TO MYSELF THE THOUGHT OF MARY CAVENDISH WAS WEIGHING ON ME WOULD IT NOT BE A TERRIBLE SHOCK TO HER FOR THE MOMENT I SET ASIDE UTTERLY ANY SUSPICIONS OF HER SHE COULD NOT BE IMPLICATEDOTHERWISE I SHOULD HAVE HEARD SOME HINT OF IT OF COURSE THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF BEING ABLE PERMANENTLY TO CONCEAL DR BAUERSTEINS ARREST FROM HER IT WOULD BE ANNOUNCED IN EVERY NEWSPAPER ON THE MORROW STILL I SHRANK FROM BLURTING IT OUT IF ONLY POIROT HAD BEEN ACCESSIBLE I COULD HAVE ASKED HIS ADVICE WHAT POSSESSED HIM TO GO POSTING OFF TO LONDON IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE WAY IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY OPINION OF HIS SAGACITY WAS IMMEASURABLY HEIGHTENED I WOULD NEVER HAVE DREAMT OF SUSPECTING THE DOCTOR HAD NOT POIROT PUT IT INTO MY HEAD YES DECIDEDLY THE LITTLE MAN WAS CLEVER AFTER SOME REFLECTING I DECIDED TO TAKE JOHN INTO MY CONFIDENCE AND LEAVE HIM TO MAKE THE MATTER PUBLIC OR NOT AS HE THOUGHT FIT HE GAVE VENT TO A PRODIGIOUS WHISTLE AS I IMPARTED THE NEWS GREAT SCOTT YOU WERE RIGHT THEN I COULDNT BELIEVE IT AT THE TIME NO IT IS ASTONISHING UNTIL YOU GET USED TO THE IDEA AND SEE HOW IT MAKES EVERYTHING FIT IN NOW WHAT ARE WE TO DO OF COURSE IT WILL BE GENERALLY KNOWN TOMORROW JOHN REFLECTED NEVER MIND HE SAID AT LAST WE WONT SAY ANYTHING AT PRESENT THERE IS NO NEED AS YOU SAY IT WILL BE KNOWN SOON ENOUGH BUT TO MY INTENSE SURPRISE ON GETTING DOWN EARLY THE NEXT MORNING AND EAGERLY OPENING THE NEWSPAPERS THERE WAS NOT A WORD ABOUT THE ARREST THERE WAS A COLUMN OF MERE PADDING ABOUT THE STYLES POISONING CASE BUT NOTHING FURTHER IT WAS RATHER INEXPLICABLE BUT I SUPPOSED THAT FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER JAPP WISHED TO KEEP IT OUT OF THE PAPERS IT WORRIED ME JUST A LITTLE FOR IT SUGGESTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MIGHT BE FURTHER ARRESTS TO COME AFTER BREAKFAST I DECIDED TO GO DOWN TO THE VILLAGE AND SEE IF POIROT HAD RETURNED YET BUT BEFORE I COULD START A WELLKNOWN FACE BLOCKED ONE OF THE WINDOWS AND THE WELLKNOWN VOICE SAID BONJOUR MON AMI POIROT I EXCLAIMED WITH RELIEF AND SEIZING HIM BY BOTH HANDS I DRAGGED HIM INTO THE ROOM I WAS NEVER SO GLAD TO SEE ANYONE LISTEN I HAVE SAID NOTHING TO ANYBODY BUT JOHN IS THAT RIGHT MY FRIEND REPLIED POIROT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT DR BAUERSTEINS ARREST OF COURSE I ANSWERED IMPATIENTLY IS BAUERSTEIN ARRESTED THEN DID YOU NOT KNOW IT NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD BUT PAUSING A MOMENT HE ADDED STILL IT DOES NOT SURPRISE ME AFTER ALL WE ARE ONLY FOUR MILES FROM THE COAST THE COAST I ASKED PUZZLED WHAT HAS THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT POIROT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS SURELY IT IS OBVIOUS NOT TO ME NO DOUBT I AM VERY DENSE BUT I CANNOT SEE WHAT THE PROXIMITY OF THE COAST HAS GOT TO DO WITH THE MURDER OF MRS INGLETHORP NOTHING AT ALL OF COURSE REPLIED POIROT SMILING BUT WE WERE SPEAKING OF THE ARREST OF DR BAUERSTEIN WELL HE IS ARRESTED FOR THE MURDER OF MRS INGLETHORP WHAT CRIED POIROT IN APPARENTLY LIVELY ASTONISHMENT DR BAUERSTEIN ARRESTED FOR THE MURDER OF MRS INGLETHORP YES IMPOSSIBLE THAT WOULD BE TOO GOOD A FARCE WHO TOLD YOU THAT MY FRIEND WELL NO ONE EXACTLY TOLD ME I CONFESSED BUT HE IS ARRESTED OH YES VERY LIKELY BUT FOR ESPIONAGE MON AMI ESPIONAGE I GASPED PRECISELY NOT FOR POISONING MRS INGLETHORP NOT UNLESS OUR FRIEND JAPP HAS TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS SENSES REPLIED POIROT PLACIDLY BUTBUT I THOUGHT YOU THOUGHT SO TOO POIROT GAVE ME ONE LOOK WHICH CONVEYED A WONDERING PITY AND HIS FULL SENSE OF THE UTTER ABSURDITY OF SUCH AN IDEA DO YOU MEAN TO SAY I ASKED SLOWLY ADAPTING MYSELF TO THE NEW IDEA THAT DR BAUERSTEIN IS A SPY POIROT NODDED HAVE YOU NEVER SUSPECTED IT IT NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD IT DID NOT STRIKE YOU AS PECULIAR THAT A FAMOUS LONDON DOCTOR SHOULD BURY HIMSELF IN A LITTLE VILLAGE LIKE THIS AND SHOULD BE IN THE HABIT OF WALKING ABOUT AT ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT FULLY DRESSED NO I CONFESSED I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING HE IS OF COURSE A GERMAN BY BIRTH SAID POIROT THOUGHTFULLY THOUGH HE HAS PRACTISED SO LONG IN THIS COUNTRY THAT NOBODY THINKS OF HIM AS ANYTHING BUT AN ENGLISHMAN HE WAS NATURALIZED ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO A VERY CLEVER MANA JEW OF COURSE THE BLACKGUARD I CRIED INDIGNANTLY NOT AT ALL HE IS ON THE CONTRARY A PATRIOT THINK WHAT HE STANDS TO LOSE I ADMIRE THE MAN MYSELF BUT I COULD NOT LOOK AT IT IN POIROTS PHILOSOPHICAL WAY AND THIS IS

PERHAPSBECAUSE I WANT TO BEFREE AND AS SHE SPOKE I HAD A SUDDEN VISION OF BROAD SPACES VIRGIN TRACTS OF FORESTS UNTRODDEN LANDSAND A REALIZATION OF WHAT FREEDOM WOULD MEAN TO SUCH A NATURE AS MARY CAVENDISH I SEEMED TO SEE HER FOR A MOMENT AS SHE WAS A PROUD WILD CREATURE AS UNTAMED BY CIVILIZATION AS SOME SHY BIRD OF THE HILLS A LITTLE CRY BROKE FROM HER LIPS YOU DONT KNOW YOU DONT KNOW HOW THIS HATEFUL PLACE HAS BEEN PRISON TO ME I UNDERSTAND I SAID BUTBUT DONT DO ANYTHING RASH OH RASH HER VOICE MOCKED AT MY PRUDENCE THEN SUDDENLY I SAID A THING I COULD HAVE BITTEN OUT MY TONGUE FOR YOU

NOT SHE MOVED AWAY A STEP OR TWO AND FINGERED ONE OF THE FLOWER VASES THESE ARE QUITE DEAD I MUST DO THEM AGAIN WOULD YOU MIND MOVINGTHANK YOU MR HASTINGS AND SHE WALKED QUIETLY PAST ME OUT OF THE WINDOW WITH A COOL LITTLE NOD OF DISMISSAL NO SURELY SHE COULD NOT CARE FOR BAUERSTEIN NO WOMAN COULD ACT HER PART WITH THAT ICY UNCONCERN POIROT DID NOT MAKE HIS APPEARANCE THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE SCOTLAND YARD MEN BUT AT LUNCHTIME THERE ARRIVED A NEW PIECE OF EVIDENCEOR RATHER LACK OF EVIDENCE WE HAD VAINLY TRIED TO TRACE THE FOURTH LETTER WHICH MRS INGLETHORP HAD WRITTEN ON THE EVENING PRECEDING HER DEATH OUR EFFORTS HAVING BEEN IN VAIN WE HAD ABANDONED THE MATTER HOPING THAT IT MIGHT TURN UP OF ITSELF ONE DAY AND THIS IS JUST WHAT DID HAPPEN IN THE SHAPE OF A COMMUNICATION WHICH ARRIVED BY THE SECOND POST FROM A FIRM OF FRENCH MUSIC PUBLISHERS ACKNOWLEDGING MRS INGLETHORPS CHEQUE AND REGRETTING THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO TRACE A CERTAIN SERIES OF RUSSIAN FOLKSONGS SO THE LAST HOPE OF SOLVING THE MYSTERY BY MEANS OF MRS INGLETHORPS CORRESPONDENCE ON THE FATAL EVENING HAD TO BE ABANDONED JUST BEFORE TEA I STROLLED DOWN TO TELL POIROT OF THE NEW DISAPPOINTMENT BUT FOUND TO MY ANNOYANCE THAT HE WAS ONCE MORE OUT GONE TO LONDON AGAIN OH NO MONSIEUR HE HAS BUT TAKEN THE TRAIN TO TADMINSTER TO SEE A YOUNG LADYS DISPENSARY HE SAID SILLY ASS I EJACULATED I TOLD HIM WEDNESDAY WAS THE ONE DAY SHE WASNT THERE WELL TELL HIM TO LOOK US UP TOMORROW MORNING WILL YOU CERTAINLY MONSIEUR BUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY NO SIGN OF POIROT I WAS GETTING ANGRY HE WAS REALLY TREATING US IN THE MOST CAVALIER FASHION AFTER LUNCH LAWRENCE DREW ME ASIDE AND ASKED IF I WAS GOING DOWN TO SEE HIM NO I DONT THINK I SHALL HE CAN COME UP HERE IF HE WANTS TO SEE US OH LAWRENCE LOOKED INDETERMINATE SOMETHING UNUSUALLY NERVOUS AND EXCITED IN HIS MANNER ROUSED MY CURIOSITY WHAT IS IT I ASKED I COULD GO IF THERES ANYTHING SPECIAL ITS NOTHING MUCH BUTWELL IF YOU ARE GOING WILL YOU TELL HIM HE DROPPED HIS VOICE TO A WHISPERI THINK IVE FOUND THE EXTRA COFFEECUP I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT ENIGMATICAL MESSAGE OF POIROTS BUT NOW MY CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED AFRESH LAWRENCE WOULD SAY NO MORE SO I DECIDED THAT I WOULD DESCEND FROM MY HIGH HORSE AND ONCE MORE SEEK OUT POIROT AT LEASTWAYS COTTAGE THIS TIME I WAS RECEIVED WITH A SMILE MONSIEUR POIROT WAS WITHIN WOULD I MOUNT I MOUNTED ACCORDINGLY POIROT WAS SITTING BY THE TABLE HIS HEAD BURIED IN HIS HANDS HE SPRANG UP AT MY ENTRANCE WHAT IS IT I ASKED SOLICITOUSLY YOU ARE NOT ILL I TRUST NO NO NOT ILL BUT I DECIDE AN AFFAIR OF GREAT MOMENT WHETHER TO CATCH THE CRIMINAL OR NOT I ASKED FACETIOUSLY BUT TO MY GREAT SURPRISE POIROT NODDED GRAVELY TO SPEAK OR NOT TO SPEAK AS YOUR SO GREAT SHAKESPEARE SAYS THAT IS THE QUESTION I DID NOT TROUBLE TO CORRECT THE QUOTATION YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS POIROT I AM OF THE MOST SERIOUS FOR THE MOST SERIOUS OF ALL THINGS HANGS IN THE BALANCE AND THAT IS A WOMANS HAPPINESS MON AMI HE SAID GRAVELY I DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT TO SAY THE MOMENT HAS COME SAID POIROT THOUGHTFULLY AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR SEE YOU IT IS A BIG STAKE FOR WHICH I PLAY NO ONE BUT I HERCULE POIROT WOULD ATTEMPT IT AND HE TAPPED HIMSELF PROUDLY ON THE BREAST AFTER PAUSING A FEW MINUTES RESPECTFULLY SO AS NOT TO SPOIL HIS EFFECT I GAVE HIM LAWRENCES MESSAGE AHA HE CRIED SO HE HAS FOUND THE EXTRA COFFEECUP THAT IS GOOD HE HAS MORE INTELLIGENCE THAN WOULD APPEAR THIS LONGFACED MONSIEUR LAWRENCE OF YOURS I DID NOT MYSELF THINK VERY HIGHLY OF LAWRENCES INTELLIGENCE BUT I FOREBORE TO CONTRADICT POIROT AND GENTLY TOOK HIM TO TASK FOR FORGETTING MY INSTRUCTIONS AS TO WHICH WERE CYNTHIAS DAYS OFF IT IS TRUE I HAVE THE HEAD OF A SIEVE HOWEVER THE OTHER YOUNG LADY WAS MOST KIND SHE WAS SORRY FOR MY DISAPPOINTMENT AND SHOWED ME EVERYTHING IN THE KINDEST WAY OH WELL THATS ALL RIGHT THEN AND YOU MUST GO TO TEA WITH CYNTHIA ANOTHER DAY I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE LETTER I AM SORRY FOR THAT HE SAID I ALWAYS HAD HOPES OF THAT LETTER BUT NO IT WAS NOT TO BE THIS AFFAIR MUST ALL BE UNRAVELLED FROM WITHIN HE TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD THESE LITTLE GREY CELLS IT IS UP TO THEMAS YOU SAY OVER HERE THEN SUDDENLY HE ASKED ARE YOU A JUDGE OF FINGERMARKS MY FRIEND NO I SAID RATHER SURPRISED I KNOW THAT THERE ARE NO TWO FINGERMARKS ALIKE BUT THATS AS FAR AS MY SCIENCE GOES EXACTLY HE UNLOCKED A LITTLE DRAWER AND TOOK OUT SOME PHOTOGRAPHS WHICH HE LAID ON THE TABLE I HAVE NUMBERED THEM WILL YOU DESCRIBE THEM TO ME I STUDIED THE PROOFS ATTENTIVELY ALL GREATLY MAGNIFIED I SEE NO I SHOULD SAY ARE A MANS FINGERPRINTS THUMB AND FIRST FINGER NO ARE A LADYS THEY ARE MUCH SMALLER AND QUITE DIFFERENT IN EVERY WAY NO I PAUSED FOR SOME TIMETHERE SEEM TO BE A LOT OF CONFUSED FINGERMARKS BUT HERE VERY DISTINCTLY ARE NO S OVERLAPPING THE OTHERS YES YOU RECOGNIZE THEM BEYOND FAIL OH YES THEY ARE IDENTICAL POIROT NODDED AND GENTLY TAKING THE PHOTOGRAPHS FROM ME LOCKED THEM UP AGAIN I SUPPOSE I SAID THAT AS USUAL YOU ARE NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN ON THE CONTRARY NO WERE THE FINGERPRINTS OF MONSIEUR LAWRENCE NO WERE THOSE OF MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA THEY ARE NOT IMPORTANT I MERELY OBTAINED THEM FOR COMPARISON NO IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED YES IT IS AS YOU SEE HIGHLY MAGNIFIED YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED A SORT OF BLUR EXTENDING ALL ACROSS THE PICTURE I WILL NOT DESCRIBE TO YOU THE SPECIAL APPARATUS DUSTING POWDER ETC WHICH I USED IT IS A WELLKNOWN PROCESS TO THE POLICE AND BY MEANS OF IT YOU CAN OBTAIN A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE FINGERPRINTS OF ANY OBJECT IN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME WELL MY FRIEND YOU HAVE SEEN THE FINGERMARKSIT REMAINS TO TELL YOU THE PARTICULAR OBJECT ON WHICH THEY HAD BEEN LEFT GO ONI AM REALLY EXCITED EH BIEN PHOTO NO REPRESENTS THE HIGHLY MAGNIFIED SURFACE OF A TINY BOTTLE IN THE TOP POISON CUPBOARD OF THE DISPENSARY IN THE RED CROSS HOSPITAL AT TADMINSTERWHICH SOUNDS LIKE THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT GOOD HEAVENS I EXCLAIMED BUT WHAT WERE LAWRENCE CAVENDISHS FINGERMARKS DOING ON IT HE NEVER WENT NEAR THE POISON CUPBOARD THE DAY WE WERE THERE OH YES HE DID IMPOSSIBLE WE WERE ALL TOGETHER THE WHOLE TIME POIROT SHOOK HIS HEAD NO MY FRIEND THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE NOT ALL TOGETHER THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN YOU COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALL TOGETHER OR IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO CALL TO MONSIEUR LAWRENCE TO COME AND JOIN YOU ON THE BALCONY ID FORGOTTEN THAT I ADMITTED BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT LONG ENOUGH LONG ENOUGH FOR WHAT POIROTS SMILE BECAME RATHER ENIGMATICAL LONG ENOUGH FOR A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD ONCE STUDIED MEDICINE TO GRATIFY A VERY NATURAL INTEREST AND CURIOSITY OUR EYES MET POIROTS WERE PLEASANTLY VAGUE HE GOT UP AND HUMMED A LITTLE TUNE I WATCHED HIM SUSPICIOUSLY POIROT I SAID WHAT WAS IN THIS PARTICULAR LITTLE BOTTLE POIROT LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW HYDROCHLORIDE OF STRYCHNINE HE SAID OVER HIS SHOULDER CONTINUING TO HUM GOOD HEAVENS I SAID IT QUITE QUIETLY I WAS NOT SURPRISED I HAD EXPECTED THAT ANSWER THEY USE THE PURE HYDROCHLORIDE OF STRYCHNINE VERY LITTLEONLY OCCASIONALLY FOR PILLS IT IS THE OFFICIAL SOLUTION LIQ STRYCHNINE HYDROCLOR THAT IS USED IN MOST MEDICINES THAT IS WHY THE FINGERMARKS HAVE REMAINED UNDISTURBED SINCE THEN HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO TAKE THIS PHOTOGRAPH I DROPPED MY HAT FROM THE BALCONY EXPLAINED POIROT SIMPLY VISITORS WERE NOT PERMITTED BELOW AT THAT HOUR SO IN SPITE OF MY MANY APOLOGIES MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIAS COLLEAGUE HAD TO GO DOWN AND FETCH IT FOR ME THEN YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO FIND NO NOT AT ALL I MERELY REALIZED THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE FROM YOUR STORY FOR MONSIEUR LAWRENCE TO GO TO THE POISON CUPBOARD THE POSSIBILITY HAD TO BE CONFIRMED OR ELIMINATED POIROT I SAID YOUR GAIETY DOES NOT DECEIVE ME THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCOVERY I DO NOT KNOW SAID POIROT BUT ONE THING DOES STRIKE ME NO DOUBT IT HAS STRUCK YOU TOO WHAT IS THAT WHY THAT THERE IS ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH STRYCHNINE ABOUT THIS CASE THIS IS THE THIRD TIME WE RUN UP AGAINST IT THERE WAS STRYCHNINE IN MRS INGLETHORPS TONIC THERE IS THE STRYCHNINE SOLD ACROSS THE COUNTER AT STYLES ST MARY BY MACE NOW WE HAVE MORE STRYCHNINE HANDLED BY ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD IT IS CONFUSING AND AS YOU KNOW I DO NOT LIKE CONFUSION BEFORE I COULD REPLY ONE OF THE OTHER BELGIANS OPENED THE DOOR AND STUCK HIS HEAD IN THERE IS A LADY BELOW ASKING FOR MR HASTINGS A LADY I JUMPED UP POIROT FOLLOWED ME DOWN THE NARROW STAIRS MARY CAVENDISH WAS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY I HAVE BEEN VISITING AN OLD WOMAN IN THE VILLAGE SHE EXPLAINED AND AS LAWRENCE TOLD ME YOU WERE WITH MONSIEUR POIROT I THOUGHT I WOULD CALL FOR YOU ALAS MADAME SAID POIROT I THOUGHT YOU HAD COME TO HONOUR ME WITH A VISIT I WILL SOME DAY IF YOU ASK ME SHE PROMISED HIM SMILING THAT IS WELL IF YOU SHOULD NEED A FATHER CONFESSOR MADAMESHE STARTED EVER SO SLIGHTLYREMEMBER PAPA POIROT IS ALWAYS AT YOUR SERVICE SHE STARED AT HIM FOR A FEW MINUTES AS THOUGH SEEKING TO READ SOME DEEPER MEANING INTO HIS WORDS THEN SHE TURNED ABRUPTLY AWAY COME WILL YOU NOT WALK BACK WITH US TOO MONSIEUR POIROT ENCHANTED MADAME ALL THE WAY TO STYLES MARY TALKED FAST AND FEVERISHLY IT STRUCK ME THAT IN SOME WAY SHE WAS NERVOUS OF POIROTS EYES THE WEATHER HAD BROKEN AND THE SHARP WIND WAS ALMOST AUTUMNAL IN ITS SHREWISHNESS MARY SHIVERED A LITTLE AND BUTTONED HER BLACK SPORTS COAT CLOSER THE WIND THROUGH THE TREES MADE A MOURNFUL NOISE LIKE SOME GREAT GIANT SIGHING WE WALKED UP TO THE GREAT DOOR OF STYLES AND AT ONCE THE KNOWLEDGE CAME TO US THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG DORCAS CAME RUNNING OUT TO MEET US SHE WAS CRYING AND WRINGING HER HANDS I WAS AWARE OF OTHER SERVANTS HUDDLED TOGETHER IN THE BACKGROUND ALL EYES AND EARS OH MAM OH MAM I DONT KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU WHAT IS IT DORCAS I ASKED IMPATIENTLY TELL US AT ONCE ITS THOSE WICKED DETECTIVES THEYVE ARRESTED HIMTHEYVE ARRESTED MR CAVENDISH ARRESTED LAWRENCE I GASPED I SAW A STRANGE LOOK COME INTO DORCASS EYES NO SIR NOT MR LAWRENCEMR JOHN BEHIND ME WITH A WILD CRY MARY CAVENDISH FELL HEAVILY AGAINST ME AND AS I TURNED TO CATCH HER I MET THE QUIET TRIUMPH IN POIROTS EYES CHAPTER XI THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION THE TRIAL OF JOHN CAVENDISH FOR THE MURDER OF HIS STEPMOTHER TOOK PLACE TWO MONTHS LATER OF THE INTERVENING WEEKS I WILL SAY LITTLE BUT MY ADMIRATION AND SYMPATHY WENT OUT UNFEIGNEDLY TO MARY CAVENDISH SHE RANGED HERSELF PASSIONATELY ON HER HUSBANDS SIDE SCORNING THE MERE IDEA OF HIS GUILT AND FOUGHT FOR HIM TOOTH AND NAIL I EXPRESSED MY ADMIRATION TO POIROT AND HE NODDED THOUGHTFULLY YES SHE IS OF THOSE WOMEN WHO SHOW AT THEIR BEST IN ADVERSITY IT BRINGS OUT ALL THAT IS SWEETEST AND TRUEST IN THEM HER PRIDE AND HER JEALOUSY HAVE JEALOUSY I QUERIED YES HAVE YOU NOT REALIZED THAT SHE IS AN UNUSUALLY JEALOUS WOMAN AS I WAS SAYING HER PRIDE AND JEALOUSY HAVE BEEN LAID ASIDE SHE THINKS OF NOTHING BUT HER HUSBAND AND THE TERRIBLE FATE THAT IS HANGING OVER HIM HE SPOKE VERY FEELINGLY AND I LOOKED AT HIM EARNESTLY REMEMBERING THAT LAST AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD BEEN DELIBERATING WHETHER OR NOT TO SPEAK WITH HIS TENDERNESS FOR A WOMANS HAPPINESS I FELT GLAD THAT THE DECISION HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF HIS HANDS EVEN NOW I SAID I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT YOU SEE UP TO THE VERY LAST MINUTE I THOUGHT IT WAS LAWRENCE POIROT GRINNED I KNOW YOU DID BUT JOHN MY OLD FRIEND JOHN EVERY MURDERER IS PROBABLY SOMEBODYS OLD FRIEND OBSERVED POIROT PHILOSOPHICALLY YOU CANNOT MIX UP SENTIMENT AND REASON I MUST SAY I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE GIVEN ME A HINT PERHAPS MON AMI I DID NOT DO SO JUST BECAUSE HE WAS YOUR OLD FRIEND I WAS RATHER DISCONCERTED BY THIS REMEMBERING HOW I HAD BUSILY PASSED ON TO JOHN WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE POIROTS VIEWS CONCERNING BAUERSTEIN HE BY THE WAY HAD BEEN ACQUITTED OF THE CHARGE BROUGHT AGAINST HIM NEVERTHELESS ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN TOO CLEVER FOR THEM THIS TIME AND THE CHARGE OF ESPIONAGE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT HOME TO HIM HIS WINGS WERE PRETTY WELL CLIPPED FOR THE FUTURE I ASKED POIROT WHETHER HE THOUGHT JOHN WOULD BE CONDEMNED TO MY INTENSE SURPRISE HE REPLIED THAT ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS EXTREMELY LIKELY TO BE ACQUITTED BUT POIROT I PROTESTED OH MY FRIEND HAVE I NOT SAID TO YOU ALL ALONG THAT I HAVE NO PROOFS IT IS ONE THING TO KNOW THAT A MAN IS GUILTY IT IS QUITE ANOTHER MATTER TO PROVE HIM SO AND IN THIS CASE THERE IS TERRIBLY LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT IS THE WHOLE TROUBLE I HERCULE POIROT KNOW BUT I LACK THE LAST LINK IN MY CHAIN AND UNLESS I CAN FIND THAT MISSING LINK HE SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY WHEN DID YOU FIRST SUSPECT JOHN CAVENDISH I ASKED AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO DID YOU NOT SUSPECT HIM AT ALL NO INDEED NOT AFTER THAT FRAGMENT OF CONVERSATION YOU OVERHEARD BETWEEN MRS CAVENDISH AND HER MOTHERINLAW AND HER SUBSEQUENT LACK OF FRANKNESS AT THE INQUEST NO DID YOU NOT PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND REFLECT THAT IF IT WAS NOT ALFRED INGLETHORP WHO WAS QUARRELLING WITH HIS WIFEAND YOU REMEMBER HE STRENUOUSLY DENIED IT AT THE INQUESTIT MUST BE EITHER LAWRENCE OR JOHN NOW IF IT WAS LAWRENCE MARY CAVENDISHS CONDUCT WAS JUST AS INEXPLICABLE BUT IF ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS JOHN THE WHOLE THING WAS EXPLAINED QUITE NATURALLY SO I CRIED A LIGHT BREAKING IN UPON ME IT WAS JOHN WHO QUARRELLED WITH HIS MOTHER THAT AFTERNOON EXACTLY AND YOU HAVE KNOWN THIS ALL ALONG CERTAINLY MRS CAVENDISHS BEHAVIOUR COULD ONLY BE EXPLAINED THAT WAY AND YET YOU SAY HE MAY BE ACQUITTED POIROT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS CERTAINLY I DO AT THE POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS WE SHALL HEAR THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION BUT IN ALL PROBABILITY HIS SOLICITORS WILL ADVISE HIM TO RESERVE HIS DEFENCE THAT WILL BE SPRUNG UPON US AT THE TRIAL ANDAH BY THE WAY I HAVE A WORD OF CAUTION TO GIVE YOU MY FRIEND I MUST NOT APPEAR IN THE CASE WHAT NO OFFICIALLY I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT UNTIL I HAVE FOUND THAT LAST LINK IN MY CHAIN I MUST REMAIN BEHIND THE SCENES MRS CAVENDISH MUST THINK I AM WORKING FOR HER HUSBAND NOT AGAINST HIM I SAY THATS PLAYING IT A BIT LOW DOWN I PROTESTED NOT AT ALL WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A MOST CLEVER AND UNSCRUPULOUS MAN AND WE MUST USE ANY MEANS IN OUR POWEROTHERWISE HE WILL SLIP THROUGH OUR FINGERS THAT IS WHY I HAVE BEEN CAREFUL TO REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND ALL THE DISCOVERIES HAVE BEEN MADE BY JAPP AND JAPP WILL TAKE ALL THE CREDIT IF I AM CALLED UPON TO GIVE EVIDENCE AT ALLHE SMILED BROADLYIT WILL PROBABLY BE AS A WITNESS FOR THE DEFENCE I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY EARS IT IS QUITE EN RGLE CONTINUED POIROT STRANGELY ENOUGH I CAN GIVE EVIDENCE THAT WILL DEMOLISH ONE CONTENTION OF THE PROSECUTION WHICH ONE THE ONE THAT RELATES TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WILL JOHN CAVENDISH DID NOT DESTROY THAT WILL POIROT WAS A TRUE PROPHET I WILL NOT GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THE POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS AS IT INVOLVES MANY TIRESOME REPETITIONS I WILL MERELY STATE BALDLY THAT JOHN CAVENDISH RESERVED HIS DEFENCE AND WAS DULY COMMITTED FOR TRIAL SEPTEMBER FOUND US ALL IN LONDON MARY TOOK A HOUSE IN KENSINGTON POIROT BEING INCLUDED IN THE FAMILY PARTY I MYSELF HAD BEEN GIVEN A JOB AT THE WAR OFFICE SO WAS ABLE TO SEE THEM CONTINUALLY AS THE WEEKS WENT BY THE STATE OF POIROTS NERVES GREW WORSE AND WORSE THAT LAST LINK HE TALKED ABOUT WAS STILL LACKING PRIVATELY I HOPED IT MIGHT REMAIN SO FOR WHAT HAPPINESS COULD THERE BE FOR MARY IF JOHN WERE NOT ACQUITTED ON SEPTEMBER TH JOHN CAVENDISH APPEARED IN THE DOCK AT THE OLD BAILEY CHARGED WITH THE WILFUL MURDER OF EMILY AGNES INGLETHORP AND PLEADED NOT GUILTY SIR ERNEST HEAVYWETHER THE FAMOUS KC HAD BEEN ENGAGED TO DEFEND HIM MR PHILIPS KC OPENED THE CASE FOR THE CROWN THE MURDER HE SAID WAS A MOST PREMEDITATED AND COLDBLOODED ONE IT WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN THE DELIBERATE POISONING OF A FOND AND TRUSTING WOMAN BY THE STEPSON TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN MORE THAN A MOTHER EVER SINCE HIS BOYHOOD SHE HAD SUPPORTED HIM HE AND HIS WIFE HAD LIVED AT STYLES COURT IN EVERY LUXURY SURROUNDED BY HER CARE AND ATTENTION SHE HAD BEEN THEIR KIND AND GENEROUS BENEFACTRESS HE PROPOSED TO CALL WITNESSES TO SHOW HOW THE PRISONER A PROFLIGATE AND SPENDTHRIFT HAD BEEN AT THE END OF HIS FINANCIAL TETHER AND HAD ALSO BEEN CARRYING ON AN INTRIGUE WITH A CERTAIN MRS RAIKES A NEIGHBOURING FARMERS WIFE THIS HAVING COME TO HIS STEPMOTHERS EARS SHE TAXED HIM WITH IT ON THE AFTERNOON BEFORE HER DEATH AND A QUARREL ENSUED PART OF WHICH WAS OVERHEARD ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THE PRISONER HAD PURCHASED STRYCHNINE AT THE VILLAGE CHEMISTS SHOP WEARING A DISGUISE BY MEANS OF WHICH HE HOPED TO THROW THE ONUS OF THE CRIME UPON ANOTHER MANTO WIT MRS INGLETHORPS HUSBAND OF WHOM HE HAD BEEN BITTERLY JEALOUS LUCKILY FOR MR INGLETHORP HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE AN UNIMPEACHABLE ALIBI ON THE AFTERNOON OF JULY TH CONTINUED COUNSEL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE QUARREL WITH HER SON MRS INGLETHORP MADE A NEW WILL THIS WILL WAS FOUND DESTROYED IN THE GRATE OF HER BEDROOM THE FOLLOWING MORNING BUT EVIDENCE HAD COME TO LIGHT WHICH SHOWED THAT IT HAD BEEN DRAWN UP IN FAVOUR OF HER HUSBAND DECEASED HAD ALREADY MADE A WILL IN HIS FAVOUR BEFORE HER MARRIAGE BUTAND MR PHILIPS WAGGED AN EXPRESSIVE FOREFINGERTHE PRISONER WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT WHAT HAD INDUCED THE DECEASED TO MAKE A FRESH WILL WITH THE OLD ONE STILL EXTANT HE COULD NOT SAY SHE WAS AN OLD LADY AND MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE FORGOTTEN THE FORMER ONE ORTHIS SEEMED TO HIM MORE LIKELYSHE MAY HAVE HAD AN IDEA THAT IT WAS REVOKED BY HER MARRIAGE AS THERE HAD BEEN SOME CONVERSATION ON THE SUBJECT LADIES WERE NOT ALWAYS VERY WELL VERSED IN LEGAL KNOWLEDGE SHE HAD ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE EXECUTED A WILL IN FAVOUR OF THE PRISONER HE WOULD CALL EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT IT WAS THE PRISONER WHO ULTIMATELY HANDED HIS STEPMOTHER HER COFFEE ON THE FATAL NIGHT LATER IN THE EVENING HE HAD SOUGHT ADMISSION TO HER ROOM ON WHICH OCCASION NO DOUBT HE FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY OF DESTROYING THE WILL WHICH AS FAR AS HE KNEW WOULD RENDER THE ONE IN HIS FAVOUR VALID THE PRISONER HAD BEEN ARRESTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DISCOVERY IN HIS ROOM BY DETECTIVE INSPECTOR JAPPA MOST BRILLIANT OFFICEROF THE IDENTICAL PHIAL OF STRYCHNINE WHICH HAD BEEN SOLD AT THE VILLAGE CHEMISTS TO THE SUPPOSED MR INGLETHORP ON THE DAY BEFORE THE MURDER IT WOULD BE FOR THE JURY TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THESE DAMNING FACTS CONSTITUTED AN OVERWHELMING PROOF OF THE PRISONERS GUILT AND SUBTLY IMPLYING THAT A JURY WHICH DID NOT SO DECIDE WAS QUITE UNTHINKABLE MR PHILIPS SAT DOWN AND WIPED HIS FOREHEAD THE FIRST WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION WERE MOSTLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN CALLED AT THE INQUEST THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE BEING AGAIN TAKEN FIRST SIR ERNEST HEAVYWETHER WHO WAS FAMOUS ALL OVER ENGLAND FOR THE UNSCRUPULOUS MANNER IN WHICH HE BULLIED WITNESSES ONLY ASKED TWO QUESTIONS I TAKE IT DR BAUERSTEIN THAT STRYCHNINE AS A DRUG ACTS QUICKLY YES AND THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DELAY IN THIS CASE YES THANK YOU MR MACE IDENTIFIED THE PHIAL HANDED HIM BY COUNSEL AS THAT SOLD BY HIM TO MR INGLETHORP PRESSED HE ADMITTED THAT HE ONLY KNEW MR INGLETHORP BY SIGHT HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM THE WITNESS WAS NOT CROSSEXAMINED ALFRED INGLETHORP WAS CALLED AND DENIED HAVING PURCHASED THE POISON HE ALSO DENIED HAVING QUARRELLED WITH HIS WIFE VARIOUS WITNESSES TESTIFIED TO THE ACCURACY OF THESE STATEMENTS THE GARDENERS EVIDENCE AS TO THE WITNESSING OF THE WILL WAS TAKEN AND THEN DORCAS WAS CALLED DORCAS FAITHFUL TO HER YOUNG GENTLEMEN DENIED STRENUOUSLY THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN JOHNS VOICE SHE HEARD AND RESOLUTELY DECLARED IN THE TEETH OF EVERYTHING THAT IT WAS MR INGLETHORP WHO HAD BEEN IN THE BOUDOIR WITH HER MISTRESS A RATHER WISTFUL SMILE PASSED ACROSS THE FACE OF THE PRISONER IN THE DOCK HE KNEW ONLY TOO WELL HOW USELESS HER GALLANT DEFIANCE WAS SINCE IT WAS NOT THE OBJECT OF THE DEFENCE TO DENY THIS POINT MRS CAVENDISH OF COURSE COULD NOT BE CALLED UPON TO GIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST HER HUSBAND AFTER VARIOUS QUESTIONS ON OTHER MATTERS MR PHILIPS ASKED IN THE MONTH OF JUNE LAST DO YOU REMEMBER A PARCEL ARRIVING FOR MR LAWRENCE CAVENDISH FROM PARKSONS DORCAS SHOOK HER HEAD I DONT REMEMBER SIR IT MAY HAVE DONE BUT MR LAWRENCE WAS AWAY

HYDROCHLORIDE OF STRYCHNINE LAWRENCE WAS TURNING A SICKLY GREENISH COLOUR NOI AM SURE I DIDNT THEN HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT YOU LEFT THE UNMISTAKABLE IMPRESS OF YOUR FINGERPRINTS ON IT THE BULLYING MANNER WAS HIGHLY EFFICACIOUS WITH A NERVOUS DISPOSITION II SUPPOSE I MUST HAVE TAKEN UP THE BOTTLE I SUPPOSE SO TOO DID YOU ABSTRACT ANY OF THE CONTENTS OF THE BOTTLE CERTAINLY NOT THEN WHY DID YOU TAKE IT UP I ONCE STUDIED TO BE A DOCTOR SUCH THINGS NATURALLY INTEREST ME AH SO POISONS NATURALLY INTEREST YOU DO THEY STILL YOU WAITED TO BE ALONE BEFORE GRATIFYING THAT INTEREST OF YOURS THAT WAS PURE CHANCE IF THE OTHERS HAD BEEN THERE I SHOULD HAVE DONE JUST THE SAME STILL AS IT HAPPENS THE OTHERS WERE NOT THERE NO BUT IN FACT DURING THE WHOLE AFTERNOON YOU WERE ONLY ALONE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND IT HAPPENEDI SAY IT HAPPENEDTO BE DURING THOSE TWO MINUTES THAT YOU DISPLAYED YOUR NATURAL INTEREST IN HYDROCHLORIDE OF STRYCHNINE LAWRENCE STAMMERED PITIABLY II WITH A SATISFIED AND EXPRESSIVE COUNTENANCE SIR ERNEST OBSERVED I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO ASK YOU MR CAVENDISH THIS BIT OF CROSSEXAMINATION HAD CAUSED GREAT EXCITEMENT IN COURT THE HEADS OF THE MANY FASHIONABLY ATTIRED WOMEN PRESENT WERE BUSILY LAID TOGETHER AND THEIR WHISPERS BECAME SO LOUD THAT THE JUDGE ANGRILY THREATENED TO HAVE THE COURT CLEARED IF THERE WAS NOT IMMEDIATE SILENCE THERE WAS LITTLE MORE EVIDENCE THE HANDWRITING EXPERTS WERE CALLED UPON FOR THEIR OPINION OF THE SIGNATURE OF ALFRED INGLETHORP IN THE CHEMISTS POISON REGISTER THEY ALL DECLARED UNANIMOUSLY THAT IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT HIS HANDWRITING AND GAVE IT AS THEIR VIEW THAT IT MIGHT BE THAT OF THE PRISONER DISGUISED CROSSEXAMINED THEY ADMITTED THAT IT MIGHT BE THE PRISONERS HANDWRITING CLEVERLY COUNTERFEITED SIR ERNEST HEAVYWETHERS SPEECH IN OPENING THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE WAS NOT A LONG ONE BUT IT WAS BACKED BY THE FULL FORCE OF HIS EMPHATIC MANNER NEVER HE SAID IN THE COURSE OF HIS LONG EXPERIENCE HAD HE KNOWN A CHARGE OF MURDER REST ON SLIGHTER EVIDENCE NOT ONLY WAS IT ENTIRELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL BUT THE GREATER PART OF IT WAS PRACTICALLY UNPROVED LET THEM TAKE THE TESTIMONY THEY HAD HEARD AND SIFT IT IMPARTIALLY THE STRYCHNINE HAD BEEN FOUND IN A DRAWER IN THE PRISONERS ROOM THAT DRAWER WAS AN UNLOCKED ONE AS HE HAD POINTED OUT AND HE SUBMITTED THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT IT WAS THE PRISONER WHO HAD CONCEALED THE POISON THERE IT WAS IN FACT A WICKED AND MALICIOUS ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF SOME THIRD PERSON TO FIX THE CRIME ON THE PRISONER THE PROSECUTION HAD BEEN UNABLE TO PRODUCE A SHRED OF EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THEIR CONTENTION THAT IT WAS THE PRISONER WHO ORDERED THE BLACK BEARD FROM PARKSONS THE QUARREL WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN PRISONER AND HIS STEPMOTHER WAS FREELY ADMITTED BUT BOTH IT AND HIS FINANCIAL EMBARRASSMENTS HAD BEEN GROSSLY EXAGGERATED HIS LEARNED FRIENDSIR ERNEST NODDED CARELESSLY AT MR PHILIPSHAD STATED THAT IF THE PRISONER WERE AN INNOCENT MAN HE WOULD HAVE COME FORWARD AT THE INQUEST TO EXPLAIN THAT IT WAS HE AND NOT MR INGLETHORP WHO HAD BEEN THE PARTICIPATOR IN THE QUARREL HE THOUGHT THE FACTS HAD BEEN MISREPRESENTED WHAT HAD ACTUALLY OCCURRED WAS THIS THE PRISONER RETURNING TO THE HOUSE ON TUESDAY EVENING HAD BEEN AUTHORITATIVELY TOLD THAT THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLENT QUARREL BETWEEN MR AND MRS INGLETHORP NO SUSPICION HAD ENTERED THE PRISONERS HEAD THAT ANYONE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE MISTAKEN HIS VOICE FOR THAT OF MR INGLETHORP HE NATURALLY CONCLUDED THAT HIS STEPMOTHER HAD HAD TWO QUARRELS THE PROSECUTION AVERRED THAT ON MONDAY JULY TH THE PRISONER HAD ENTERED THE CHEMISTS SHOP IN THE VILLAGE DISGUISED AS MR INGLETHORP THE PRISONER ON THE CONTRARY WAS AT THAT TIME AT A LONELY SPOT CALLED MARSTONS SPINNEY WHERE HE HAD BEEN SUMMONED BY AN ANONYMOUS NOTE COUCHED IN BLACKMAILING TERMS AND THREATENING TO REVEAL CERTAIN MATTERS TO HIS WIFE UNLESS HE COMPLIED WITH ITS DEMANDS THE PRISONER HAD ACCORDINGLY GONE TO THE APPOINTED SPOT AND AFTER WAITING THERE VAINLY FOR HALF AN HOUR HAD RETURNED HOME UNFORTUNATELY HE HAD MET WITH NO ONE ON THE WAY THERE OR BACK WHO COULD VOUCH FOR THE TRUTH OF HIS STORY BUT LUCKILY HE HAD KEPT THE NOTE AND IT WOULD BE PRODUCED AS EVIDENCE AS FOR THE STATEMENT RELATING TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WILL THE PRISONER HAD FORMERLY PRACTISED AT THE BAR AND WAS PERFECTLY WELL AWARE THAT THE WILL MADE IN HIS FAVOUR A YEAR BEFORE WAS AUTOMATICALLY REVOKED BY HIS STEPMOTHERS REMARRIAGE HE WOULD CALL EVIDENCE TO SHOW WHO DID DESTROY THE WILL AND IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THAT MIGHT OPEN UP QUITE A NEW VIEW OF THE CASE FINALLY HE WOULD POINT OUT TO THE JURY THAT THERE WAS EVIDENCE AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES JOHN CAVENDISH HE WOULD DIRECT THEIR ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST MR LAWRENCE CAVENDISH WAS QUITE AS STRONG IF NOT STRONGER THAN THAT AGAINST HIS BROTHER HE WOULD NOW CALL THE PRISONER JOHN ACQUITTED HIMSELF WELL IN THE WITNESSBOX UNDER SIR ERNESTS SKILFUL HANDLING HE TOLD HIS TALE CREDIBLY AND WELL THE ANONYMOUS NOTE RECEIVED BY HIM WAS PRODUCED AND HANDED TO THE JURY TO EXAMINE THE READINESS WITH WHICH HE ADMITTED HIS FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES AND THE DISAGREEMENT WITH HIS STEPMOTHER LENT VALUE TO HIS DENIALS AT THE CLOSE OF HIS EXAMINATION HE PAUSED AND SAID I SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE THING CLEAR I UTTERLY REJECT AND DISAPPROVE OF SIR ERNEST HEAVYWETHERS INSINUATIONS AGAINST MY BROTHER MY BROTHER I AM CONVINCED HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH THE CRIME THAN I HAVE SIR ERNEST MERELY SMILED AND NOTED WITH A SHARP EYE THAT JOHNS PROTEST HAD PRODUCED A VERY FAVOURABLE IMPRESSION ON THE JURY THEN THE CROSSEXAMINATION BEGAN I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT IT NEVER ENTERED YOUR HEAD THAT THE WITNESSES AT THE INQUEST COULD POSSIBLY HAVE MISTAKEN YOUR VOICE FOR THAT OF MR INGLETHORP IS NOT THAT VERY SURPRISING NO I DONT THINK SO I WAS TOLD THERE HAD BEEN A QUARREL BETWEEN MY MOTHER AND MR INGLETHORP AND IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT SUCH WAS NOT REALLY THE CASE NOT WHEN THE SERVANT DORCAS REPEATED CERTAIN FRAGMENTS OF THE CONVERSATIONFRAGMENTS WHICH YOU MUST HAVE RECOGNIZED I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THEM YOUR MEMORY MUST BE UNUSUALLY SHORT NO BUT WE WERE BOTH ANGRY AND I THINK SAID MORE THAN WE MEANT I PAID VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO MY MOTHERS ACTUAL WORDS MR PHILIPS INCREDULOUS SNIFF WAS A TRIUMPH OF FORENSIC SKILL HE PASSED ON TO THE SUBJECT OF THE NOTE YOU HAVE PRODUCED THIS NOTE VERY OPPORTUNELY TELL ME IS THERE NOTHING FAMILIAR ABOUT THE HANDWRITING OF IT NOT THAT I KNOW OF DO YOU NOT THINK THAT IT BEARS A MARKED RESEMBLANCE TO YOUR OWN HANDWRITINGCARELESSLY DISGUISED NO I DO NOT THINK SO I PUT IT TO YOU THAT IT IS YOUR OWN HANDWRITING NO I PUT IT TO YOU THAT ANXIOUS TO PROVE AN ALIBI YOU CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF A FICTITIOUS AND RATHER INCREDIBLE APPOINTMENT AND WROTE THIS NOTE YOURSELF IN ORDER TO BEAR OUT YOUR STATEMENT NO IS IT NOT A FACT THAT AT THE TIME YOU CLAIM TO HAVE BEEN WAITING ABOUT AT A SOLITARY AND UNFREQUENTED SPOT YOU WERE REALLY IN THE CHEMISTS SHOP IN STYLES ST MARY WHERE YOU PURCHASED STRYCHNINE IN THE NAME OF ALFRED INGLETHORP NO THAT IS A LIE I PUT IT TO YOU THAT WEARING A SUIT OF MR INGLETHORPS CLOTHES WITH A BLACK BEARD TRIMMED TO RESEMBLE HIS YOU WERE THEREAND SIGNED THE REGISTER IN HIS NAME THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE THEN I WILL LEAVE THE REMARKABLE SIMILARITY OF HANDWRITING BETWEEN THE NOTE THE REGISTER AND YOUR OWN TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE JURY SAID MR PHILIPS AND SAT DOWN WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO HAS DONE HIS DUTY BUT WHO WAS NEVERTHELESS HORRIFIED BY SUCH DELIBERATE PERJURY AFTER THIS AS IT WAS GROWING LATE THE CASE WAS ADJOURNED TILL MONDAY POIROT I NOTICED WAS LOOKING PROFOUNDLY DISCOURAGED HE HAD THAT LITTLE FROWN BETWEEN THE EYES THAT I KNEW SO WELL WHAT IS IT POIROT I INQUIRED AH MON AMI THINGS ARE GOING BADLY BADLY IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY HEART GAVE A LEAP OF RELIEF EVIDENTLY THERE WAS A LIKELIHOOD OF JOHN CAVENDISH BEING ACQUITTED WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE MY LITTLE FRIEND WAVED ASIDE MARYS OFFER OF TEA NO I THANK YOU MADAME I WILL MOUNT TO MY ROOM I FOLLOWED HIM STILL FROWNING HE WENT ACROSS TO THE DESK AND TOOK OUT A SMALL PACK OF PATIENCE CARDS THEN HE DREW UP A CHAIR TO THE TABLE AND TO MY UTTER AMAZEMENT BEGAN SOLEMNLY TO BUILD CARD HOUSES MY JAW DROPPED INVOLUNTARILY AND HE SAID AT ONCE NO MON AMI I AM NOT IN MY SECOND CHILDHOOD I STEADY MY NERVES THAT IS ALL THIS EMPLOYMENT REQUIRES PRECISION OF THE FINGERS WITH PRECISION OF THE FINGERS GOES PRECISION OF THE BRAIN AND NEVER HAVE I NEEDED THAT MORE THAN NOW WHAT IS THE TROUBLE I ASKED WITH A GREAT THUMP ON THE TABLE POIROT DEMOLISHED HIS CAREFULLY BUILT UP EDIFICE IT IS THIS MON AMI THAT I CAN BUILD CARD HOUSES SEVEN STORIES HIGH BUT I CANNOTTHUMPFINDTHUMP THAT LAST LINK OF WHICH I SPOKE TO YOU I COULD NOT QUITE TELL WHAT TO SAY SO I HELD MY PEACE AND HE BEGAN SLOWLY BUILDING UP THE CARDS AGAIN SPEAKING IN JERKS AS HE DID SO IT IS DONESO BY PLACINGONE CARDON ANOTHERWITH MATHEMATICALPRECISION I WATCHED THE CARD HOUSE RISING UNDER HIS HANDS STORY BY STORY HE NEVER HESITATED OR FALTERED IT WAS REALLY ALMOST LIKE A CONJURING TRICK WHAT A STEADY HAND YOUVE GOT I REMARKED I BELIEVE IVE ONLY SEEN YOUR HAND SHAKE ONCE ON AN OCCASION WHEN I WAS ENRAGED WITHOUT DOUBT OBSERVED POIROT WITH GREAT PLACIDITY YES INDEED YOU WERE IN A TOWERING RAGE DO YOU REMEMBER IT WAS WHEN YOU DISCOVERED THAT THE LOCK OF THE DESPATCHCASE IN MRS INGLETHORPS BEDROOM HAD BEEN FORCED YOU STOOD BY THE MANTELPIECE TWIDDLING THE THINGS ON IT IN YOUR USUAL FASHION AND YOUR HAND SHOOK LIKE A LEAF I MUST SAY BUT I STOPPED SUDDENLY FOR POIROT UTTERING A HOARSE AND INARTICULATE CRY AGAIN ANNIHILATED HIS MASTERPIECE OF CARDS AND PUTTING HIS HANDS OVER HIS EYES SWAYED BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS APPARENTLY SUFFERING THE KEENEST AGONY GOOD HEAVENS POIROT I CRIED WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE YOU TAKEN ILL NO NO HE GASPED IT ISIT ISTHAT I HAVE AN IDEA OH I EXCLAIMED MUCH RELIEVED ONE OF YOUR LITTLE IDEAS AH MA FOI NO REPLIED POIROT FRANKLY THIS TIME IT IS AN IDEA GIGANTIC STUPENDOUS AND YOUYOU MY FRIEND HAVE GIVEN IT TO ME SUDDENLY CLASPING ME IN HIS ARMS HE KISSED ME WARMLY ON BOTH CHEEKS AND BEFORE I HAD RECOVERED FROM MY SURPRISE RAN HEADLONG FROM THE ROOM MARY CAVENDISH ENTERED AT THAT MOMENT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH MONSIEUR POIROT HE RUSHED PAST ME CRYING OUT A GARAGE FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN DIRECT ME TO A GARAGE MADAME AND BEFORE I COULD ANSWER HE HAD DASHED OUT INTO THE STREET I HURRIED TO THE WINDOW TRUE ENOUGH THERE HE WAS TEARING DOWN THE STREET HATLESS AND GESTICULATING AS HE WENT I TURNED TO MARY WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR HELL BE STOPPED BY A POLICEMAN IN ANOTHER MINUTE THERE HE GOES ROUND THE CORNER OUR EYES MET AND WE STARED HELPLESSLY AT ONE ANOTHER WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER I SHOOK MY HEAD I DONT KNOW HE WAS BUILDING CARD HOUSES WHEN SUDDENLY HE SAID HE HAD AN IDEA AND RUSHED OFF AS YOU SAW WELL SAID MARY I EXPECT HE WILL BE BACK BEFORE DINNER BUT NIGHT FELL AND POIROT HAD NOT RETURNED CHAPTER XII THE LAST LINK POIROTS ABRUPT DEPARTURE HAD INTRIGUED US ALL GREATLY SUNDAY MORNING WORE AWAY AND STILL HE DID NOT REAPPEAR BUT ABOUT THREE OCLOCK A FEROCIOUS AND PROLONGED HOOTING OUTSIDE DROVE US TO THE WINDOW TO SEE POIROT ALIGHTING FROM A CAR ACCOMPANIED BY JAPP AND SUMMERHAYE THE LITTLE MAN WAS TRANSFORMED HE RADIATED AN ABSURD COMPLACENCY HE BOWED WITH EXAGGERATED RESPECT TO MARY CAVENDISH MADAME I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO HOLD A LITTLE RUNION IN THE SALON IT IS NECESSARY FOR EVERYONE TO ATTEND MARY SMILED SADLY YOU KNOW MONSIEUR POIROT THAT YOU HAVE CARTE BLANCHE IN EVERY WAY YOU ARE TOO AMIABLE MADAME STILL BEAMING POIROT MARSHALLED US ALL INTO THE DRAWINGROOM BRINGING FORWARD CHAIRS AS HE DID SO MISS HOWARDHERE MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA MONSIEUR LAWRENCE THE GOOD DORCAS AND ANNIE BIEN WE MUST DELAY OUR PROCEEDINGS A FEW MINUTES UNTIL MR INGLETHORP ARRIVES I HAVE SENT HIM A NOTE MISS HOWARD ROSE IMMEDIATELY FROM HER SEAT IF THAT MAN COMES INTO THE HOUSE I LEAVE IT NO NO POIROT WENT UP TO HER AND PLEADED IN A LOW VOICE FINALLY MISS HOWARD CONSENTED TO RETURN TO HER CHAIR A FEW MINUTES LATER ALFRED INGLETHORP ENTERED THE ROOM THE COMPANY ONCE ASSEMBLED POIROT ROSE FROM HIS SEAT WITH THE AIR OF A POPULAR LECTURER AND BOWED POLITELY TO HIS AUDIENCE MESSIEURS MESDAMES AS YOU ALL KNOW I WAS CALLED IN BY MONSIEUR JOHN CAVENDISH TO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE I AT ONCE EXAMINED THE BEDROOM OF THE DECEASED WHICH BY THE ADVICE OF THE DOCTORS HAD BEEN KEPT LOCKED AND WAS CONSEQUENTLY EXACTLY AS IT HAD BEEN WHEN THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED I FOUND FIRST A FRAGMENT OF GREEN MATERIAL SECOND A STAIN ON THE CARPET NEAR THE WINDOW STILL DAMP THIRDLY AN EMPTY BOX OF BROMIDE POWDERS TO TAKE THE FRAGMENT OF GREEN MATERIAL FIRST I FOUND IT CAUGHT IN THE BOLT OF THE COMMUNICATING DOOR BETWEEN THAT ROOM AND THE ADJOINING ONE OCCUPIED BY MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA I HANDED THE FRAGMENT OVER TO THE POLICE WHO DID NOT CONSIDER IT OF MUCH IMPORTANCE NOR DID THEY RECOGNIZE IT FOR WHAT IT WASA PIECE TORN FROM A GREEN LAND ARMLET THERE WAS A LITTLE STIR OF EXCITEMENT NOW THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON AT STYLES WHO WORKED ON THE LANDMRS CAVENDISH THEREFORE IT MUST HAVE BEEN MRS CAVENDISH WHO ENTERED THE DECEASEDS ROOM THROUGH THE DOOR COMMUNICATING WITH MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIAS ROOM BUT THAT DOOR WAS BOLTED ON THE INSIDE I CRIED WHEN I EXAMINED THE ROOM YES BUT IN THE FIRST PLACE WE HAVE ONLY HER WORD FOR IT SINCE IT WAS SHE WHO TRIED THAT PARTICULAR DOOR AND REPORTED IT FASTENED IN THE ENSUING CONFUSION SHE WOULD HAVE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOOT THE BOLT ACROSS I TOOK AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY OF VERIFYING MY CONJECTURES TO BEGIN WITH THE FRAGMENT CORRESPONDS EXACTLY WITH A TEAR IN MRS CAVENDISHS ARMLET ALSO AT THE INQUEST MRS CAVENDISH DECLARED THAT SHE HAD HEARD FROM HER OWN ROOM THE FALL OF THE TABLE BY THE BED I TOOK AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY OF TESTING THAT STATEMENT BY STATIONING MY FRIEND MONSIEUR HASTINGS IN THE LEFT WING OF THE BUILDING JUST OUTSIDE MRS CAVENDISHS DOOR I MYSELF IN COMPANY WITH THE POLICE WENT TO THE DECEASEDS ROOM AND WHILST THERE I APPARENTLY ACCIDENTALLY KNOCKED OVER THE TABLE IN QUESTION BUT FOUND THAT AS I HAD EXPECTED MONSIEUR HASTINGS HAD HEARD NO SOUND AT ALL THIS CONFIRMED MY BELIEF THAT MRS CAVENDISH WAS NOT SPEAKING THE TRUTH WHEN SHE DECLARED THAT SHE HAD BEEN DRESSING IN HER ROOM AT THE TIME OF THE TRAGEDY IN FACT I WAS CONVINCED THAT FAR FROM HAVING BEEN IN HER OWN ROOM MRS CAVENDISH WAS ACTUALLY IN THE DECEASEDS ROOM WHEN THE ALARM WAS GIVEN I SHOT A QUICK GLANCE AT MARY SHE WAS VERY PALE BUT SMILING I PROCEEDED TO REASON ON THAT ASSUMPTION MRS CAVENDISH IS IN HER MOTHERINLAWS ROOM WE WILL SAY THAT SHE IS SEEKING FOR SOMETHING AND HAS NOT YET FOUND IT SUDDENLY MRS INGLETHORP AWAKENS AND IS SEIZED WITH AN ALARMING PAROXYSM SHE FLINGS OUT HER ARM OVERTURNING THE BED TABLE AND THEN PULLS DESPERATELY AT THE BELL MRS CAVENDISH STARTLED DROPS HER CANDLE SCATTERING THE GREASE ON THE CARPET SHE PICKS IT UP AND RETREATS QUICKLY TO MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIAS ROOM CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER SHE HURRIES OUT INTO THE PASSAGE FOR THE SERVANTS MUST NOT FIND HER WHERE SHE IS BUT IT IS TOO LATE ALREADY FOOTSTEPS ARE ECHOING ALONG THE GALLERY WHICH CONNECTS THE TWO WINGS WHAT CAN SHE DO QUICK AS THOUGHT SHE HURRIES BACK TO THE YOUNG GIRLS ROOM AND STARTS SHAKING HER AWAKE THE HASTILY AROUSED HOUSEHOLD COME TROOPING DOWN THE PASSAGE THEY ARE ALL BUSILY BATTERING AT MRS INGLETHORPS DOOR IT OCCURS TO NOBODY THAT MRS CAVENDISH HAS NOT ARRIVED WITH THE REST BUTAND THIS IS SIGNIFICANTI CAN FIND NO ONE WHO SAW HER COME FROM THE OTHER WING HE LOOKED AT MARY CAVENDISH AM I RIGHT MADAME SHE BOWED HER HEAD QUITE RIGHT MONSIEUR YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF I HAD THOUGHT I WOULD DO MY HUSBAND ANY GOOD BY REVEALING THESE FACTS I WOULD HAVE DONE SO BUT IT DID NOT SEEM TO ME TO BEAR UPON THE QUESTION OF HIS GUILT OR INNOCENCE IN A SENSE THAT IS CORRECT MADAME BUT IT CLEARED MY MIND OF MANY MISCONCEPTIONS AND LEFT ME FREE TO SEE OTHER FACTS IN THEIR TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THE WILL CRIED LAWRENCE THEN IT WAS YOU MARY WHO DESTROYED THE WILL SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND POIROT SHOOK HIS ALSO NO HE SAID QUIETLY THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON WHO COULD POSSIBLY HAVE DESTROYED THAT WILLMRS INGLETHORP HERSELF IMPOSSIBLE I EXCLAIMED SHE HAD ONLY MADE IT OUT THAT VERY AFTERNOON NEVERTHELESS MON AMI IT WAS MRS INGLETHORP BECAUSE IN NO OTHER WAY CAN YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT ON ONE OF THE HOTTEST DAYS OF THE YEAR MRS INGLETHORP ORDERED A FIRE TO BE LIGHTED IN HER ROOM I GAVE A GASP WHAT IDIOTS WE HAD BEEN NEVER TO THINK OF THAT FIRE AS BEING INCONGRUOUS POIROT WAS CONTINUING THE TEMPERATURE ON THAT DAY MESSIEURS WAS DEGREES IN THE SHADE YET MRS INGLETHORP ORDERED A FIRE WHY BECAUSE SHE WISHED TO DESTROY SOMETHING AND COULD THINK OF NO OTHER WAY YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE WAR ECONOMICS PRACTICED AT STYLES NO WASTE PAPER WAS THROWN AWAY THERE WAS THEREFORE NO MEANS OF DESTROYING A THICK DOCUMENT SUCH AS A WILL THE MOMENT I HEARD OF A FIRE BEING LIGHTED IN MRS INGLETHORPS ROOM I LEAPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS TO DESTROY SOME IMPORTANT DOCUMENTPOSSIBLY A WILL SO THE DISCOVERY OF THE CHARRED FRAGMENT IN THE GRATE WAS NO SURPRISE TO ME I DID NOT OF COURSE KNOW AT THE TIME THAT THE WILL IN QUESTION HAD ONLY BEEN MADE THIS AFTERNOON AND I WILL ADMIT THAT WHEN I LEARNT THAT FACT I FELL INTO A GRIEVOUS ERROR I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MRS INGLETHORPS DETERMINATION TO DESTROY HER WILL AROSE AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE QUARREL SHE HAD THAT AFTERNOON AND THAT THEREFORE THE QUARREL TOOK PLACE AFTER AND NOT BEFORE THE MAKING OF THE WILL HERE AS WE KNOW I WAS WRONG AND I WAS FORCED TO ABANDON THAT IDEA I FACED THE PROBLEM FROM A NEW STANDPOINT NOW AT FOUR OCLOCK DORCAS OVERHEARD HER MISTRESS SAYING ANGRILY YOU NEED NOT THINK THAT ANY FEAR OF PUBLICITY OR SCANDAL BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE WILL DETER ME I CONJECTURED AND CONJECTURED RIGHTLY THAT THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED NOT TO HER HUSBAND BUT TO MR JOHN CAVENDISH AT FIVE OCLOCK AN HOUR LATER SHE USES ALMOST THE SAME WORDS BUT THE STANDPOINT IS DIFFERENT SHE ADMITS TO DORCAS I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO SCANDAL BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE IS A DREADFUL THING AT FOUR OCLOCK SHE HAS BEEN ANGRY BUT COMPLETELY MISTRESS OF HERSELF AT FIVE OCLOCK SHE IS IN VIOLENT DISTRESS AND SPEAKS OF HAVING HAD A GREAT SHOCK LOOKING AT THE MATTER PSYCHOLOGICALLY I DREW ONE DEDUCTION WHICH I WAS CONVINCED WAS CORRECT THE SECOND SCANDAL SHE SPOKE OF WAS NOT THE SAME AS THE FIRSTAND IT CONCERNED HERSELF LET US RECONSTRUCT AT FOUR OCLOCK MRS INGLETHORP QUARRELS WITH HER SON AND THREATENS TO DENOUNCE HIM TO HIS WIFEWHO BY THE WAY OVERHEARD THE GREATER PART OF THE CONVERSATION AT FOURTHIRTY MRS INGLETHORP IN CONSEQUENCE OF A CONVERSATION ON THE VALIDITY OF WILLS MAKES A WILL IN FAVOUR OF HER HUSBAND WHICH THE TWO GARDENERS WITNESS AT FIVE OCLOCK DORCAS FINDS HER MISTRESS IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE AGITATION WITH A SLIP OF PAPERA LETTER DORCAS THINKSIN HER HAND AND IT IS THEN THAT SHE ORDERS THE FIRE IN HER ROOM TO BE LIGHTED PRESUMABLY THEN BETWEEN FOURTHIRTY AND FIVE OCLOCK SOMETHING HAS OCCURRED TO OCCASION A COMPLETE REVOLUTION OF FEELING SINCE SHE IS NOW AS ANXIOUS TO DESTROY THE WILL AS SHE WAS BEFORE TO MAKE IT WHAT WAS THAT SOMETHING AS FAR AS WE KNOW SHE WAS QUITE ALONE DURING THAT HALFHOUR NOBODY ENTERED OR LEFT THAT BOUDOIR WHAT THEN OCCASIONED THIS SUDDEN CHANGE OF SENTIMENT ONE CAN ONLY GUESS BUT I BELIEVE MY GUESS TO BE CORRECT MRS INGLETHORP HAD NO STAMPS IN HER DESK WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE LATER SHE ASKED DORCAS TO BRING HER SOME NOW IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE ROOM STOOD HER HUSBANDS DESKLOCKED SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO FIND SOME STAMPS AND ACCORDING TO MY THEORY SHE TRIED HER OWN KEYS IN THE DESK THAT ONE OF THEM FITTED I KNOW SHE THEREFORE OPENED THE DESK AND IN SEARCHING FOR THE STAMPS SHE CAME ACROSS SOMETHING ELSETHAT SLIP OF PAPER WHICH DORCAS SAW IN HER HAND AND WHICH ASSUREDLY WAS NEVER MEANT FOR MRS INGLETHORPS EYES ON THE OTHER HAND MRS CAVENDISH BELIEVED THAT THE SLIP OF PAPER TO WHICH HER MOTHERINLAW CLUNG SO TENACIOUSLY WAS A WRITTEN PROOF OF HER OWN HUSBANDS INFIDELITY SHE DEMANDED IT FROM MRS INGLETHORP WHO ASSURED HER QUITE TRULY THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT MATTER MRS CAVENDISH DID NOT BELIEVE HER SHE THOUGHT THAT MRS INGLETHORP WAS SHIELDING HER STEPSON NOW MRS CAVENDISH IS A VERY RESOLUTE WOMAN AND BEHIND HER MASK OF RESERVE SHE WAS MADLY JEALOUS OF HER HUSBAND SHE DETERMINED TO GET HOLD OF THAT PAPER AT ALL COSTS AND IN THIS RESOLUTION CHANCE CAME TO HER AID SHE HAPPENED TO PICK UP THE KEY OF MRS INGLETHORPS DESPATCHCASE WHICH HAD BEEN LOST THAT MORNING SHE KNEW THAT HER MOTHERINLAW INVARIABLY KEPT ALL IMPORTANT PAPERS IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE MRS CAVENDISH THEREFORE MADE HER PLANS AS ONLY A WOMAN DRIVEN DESPERATE THROUGH JEALOUSY COULD HAVE DONE SOME TIME IN THE EVENING SHE UNBOLTED THE DOOR LEADING INTO MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIAS ROOM POSSIBLY SHE APPLIED OIL TO THE HINGES FOR I FOUND THAT IT OPENED QUITE NOISELESSLY WHEN I TRIED IT SHE PUT OFF HER PROJECT UNTIL THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING AS BEING SAFER SINCE THE SERVANTS WERE ACCUSTOMED TO HEARING HER MOVE ABOUT HER ROOM AT THAT TIME SHE DRESSED COMPLETELY IN HER LAND KIT AND MADE HER WAY QUIETLY THROUGH MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIAS ROOM INTO THAT OF MRS INGLETHORP HE PAUSED A MOMENT AND CYNTHIA INTERRUPTED BUT I SHOULD HAVE WOKEN UP IF ANYONE HAD COME THROUGH MY ROOM NOT IF YOU WERE DRUGGED MADEMOISELLE DRUGGED MAIS OUI YOU REMEMBERHE ADDRESSED US COLLECTIVELY AGAINTHAT THROUGH ALL THE TUMULT AND NOISE NEXT DOOR MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA SLEPT THAT ADMITTED OF TWO POSSIBILITIES EITHER HER SLEEP WAS FEIGNEDWHICH I DID NOT BELIEVEOR HER UNCONSCIOUSNESS WAS INDEED BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS WITH THIS LATTER IDEA IN MY MIND I EXAMINED ALL THE COFFEECUPS MOST CAREFULLY REMEMBERING THAT IT WAS MRS CAVENDISH WHO HAD BROUGHT MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA HER COFFEE THE NIGHT BEFORE I TOOK A SAMPLE FROM EACH CUP AND HAD THEM ANALYSEDWITH NO RESULT I HAD COUNTED THE CUPS CAREFULLY IN THE EVENT OF ONE HAVING BEEN REMOVED SIX PERSONS HAD TAKEN COFFEE AND SIX CUPS WERE DULY FOUND I HAD TO CONFESS MYSELF MISTAKEN THEN I DISCOVERED THAT I HAD BEEN GUILTY OF A VERY GRAVE OVERSIGHT COFFEE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FOR SEVEN PERSONS NOT SIX FOR DR BAUERSTEIN HAD BEEN THERE THAT EVENING THIS CHANGED THE FACE OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS NOW ONE CUP MISSING THE SERVANTS NOTICED NOTHING SINCE ANNIE THE HOUSEMAID WHO TOOK IN THE COFFEE BROUGHT IN SEVEN CUPS NOT KNOWING THAT MR INGLETHORP NEVER DRANK IT WHEREAS DORCAS WHO CLEARED THEM AWAY THE FOLLOWING MORNING FOUND SIX AS USUALOR STRICTLY SPEAKING SHE FOUND FIVE THE SIXTH BEING THE ONE FOUND BROKEN IN MRS INGLETHORPS ROOM I WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE MISSING CUP WAS THAT OF MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA I HAD AN ADDITIONAL REASON FOR THAT BELIEF IN THE FACT THAT ALL THE CUPS FOUND CONTAINED SUGAR WHICH MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA NEVER TOOK IN HER COFFEE MY ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY THE STORY OF ANNIE ABOUT SOME SALT ON THE TRAY OF COCOA WHICH SHE TOOK EVERY NIGHT TO MRS INGLETHORPS ROOM I ACCORDINGLY SECURED A SAMPLE OF THAT COCOA AND SENT IT TO BE ANALYSED BUT THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE BY DR BAUERSTEIN SAID LAWRENCE QUICKLY NOT EXACTLY THE ANALYST WAS ASKED BY HIM TO REPORT WHETHER STRYCHNINE WAS OR WAS NOT PRESENT HE DID NOT HAVE IT TESTED AS I DID FOR A NARCOTIC FOR A NARCOTIC YES HERE IS THE ANALYSTS REPORT MRS CAVENDISH ADMINISTERED A SAFE BUT EFFECTUAL NARCOTIC TO BOTH MRS INGLETHORP AND MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE HAD A MAUVAIS QUART DHEURE IN CONSEQUENCE IMAGINE HER FEELINGS WHEN HER MOTHERINLAW IS SUDDENLY TAKEN ILL AND DIES AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER SHE HEARS THE WORD POISON SHE HAS BELIEVED THAT THE SLEEPING DRAUGHT SHE ADMINISTERED WAS PERFECTLY HARMLESS BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT FOR ONE TERRIBLE MOMENT SHE MUST HAVE FEARED THAT MRS INGLETHORPS DEATH LAY AT HER DOOR SHE IS SEIZED WITH PANIC AND UNDER ITS INFLUENCE SHE HURRIES DOWNSTAIRS AND QUICKLY DROPS THE COFFEECUP AND SAUCER USED BY MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA INTO A LARGE BRASS VASE WHERE IT IS DISCOVERED LATER BY MONSIEUR LAWRENCE THE REMAINS OF THE COCOA SHE DARE NOT TOUCH TOO MANY EYES ARE UPON HER GUESS AT HER RELIEF WHEN STRYCHNINE IS MENTIONED AND SHE DISCOVERS THAT AFTER ALL THE TRAGEDY IS NOT HER DOING WE ARE NOW ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF STRYCHNINE POISONING BEING SO LONG IN MAKING THEIR APPEARANCE A NARCOTIC TAKEN WITH STRYCHNINE WILL DELAY THE ACTION OF THE POISON FOR SOME HOURS POIROT PAUSED MARY LOOKED UP AT HIM THE COLOUR SLOWLY RISING IN HER FACE ALL YOU HAVE SAID IS QUITE TRUE MONSIEUR POIROT IT WAS THE MOST AWFUL HOUR OF MY LIFE I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT BUT YOU ARE WONDERFUL I UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT I MEANT WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD SAFELY CONFESS TO PAPA POIROT EH BUT YOU WOULD NOT TRUST ME I SEE EVERYTHING NOW SAID LAWRENCE THE DRUGGED COCOA TAKEN ON TOP OF THE POISONED COFFEE AMPLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE DELAY EXACTLY BUT WAS THE COFFEE POISONED OR WAS IT NOT WE COME TO A LITTLE DIFFICULTY HERE SINCE MRS INGLETHORP NEVER DRANK IT WHAT THE CRY OF SURPRISE WAS UNIVERSAL NO YOU WILL REMEMBER MY SPEAKING OF A STAIN ON THE CARPET IN MRS INGLETHORPS ROOM THERE WERE SOME PECULIAR POINTS ABOUT THAT STAIN IT WAS STILL DAMP IT EXHALED A STRONG ODOUR OF COFFEE AND IMBEDDED IN THE NAP OF THE CARPET I FOUND SOME LITTLE SPLINTERS OF CHINA WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS PLAIN TO ME FOR NOT TWO MINUTES BEFORE I HAD PLACED MY LITTLE CASE ON THE TABLE NEAR THE WINDOW AND THE TABLE TILTING UP HAD DEPOSITED IT UPON THE FLOOR ON PRECISELY THE IDENTICAL SPOT IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY MRS INGLETHORP HAD LAID DOWN HER CUP OF COFFEE ON REACHING HER ROOM THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE TREACHEROUS TABLE HAD PLAYED HER THE SAME TRICK WHAT HAPPENED NEXT IS MERE GUESS WORK ON MY PART BUT I SHOULD SAY THAT MRS INGLETHORP PICKED UP THE BROKEN CUP AND PLACED IT ON THE TABLE BY THE BED FEELING IN NEED OF A STIMULANT OF SOME KIND SHE HEATED UP HER COCOA AND DRANK IT OFF THEN AND THERE NOW WE ARE FACED WITH A NEW PROBLEM WE KNOW THE COCOA CONTAINED NO STRYCHNINE THE COFFEE WAS NEVER DRUNK YET THE STRYCHNINE MUST HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED BETWEEN SEVEN AND NINE OCLOCK THAT EVENING WHAT THIRD MEDIUM WAS THEREA MEDIUM SO SUITABLE FOR DISGUISING THE TASTE OF STRYCHNINE THAT IT IS EXTRAORDINARY NO ONE HAS THOUGHT OF IT POIROT LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM AND THEN ANSWERED HIMSELF IMPRESSIVELY HER MEDICINE DO YOU MEAN THAT THE MURDERER INTRODUCED THE STRYCHNINE INTO HER TONIC I CRIED THERE WAS NO NEED TO INTRODUCE IT IT WAS ALREADY THEREIN THE MIXTURE THE STRYCHNINE THAT KILLED MRS INGLETHORP WAS THE IDENTICAL STRYCHNINE PRESCRIBED BY DR WILKINS TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO YOU I WILL READ YOU AN EXTRACT FROM A BOOK ON DISPENSING WHICH I FOUND IN THE DISPENSARY OF THE RED CROSS HOSPITAL AT TADMINSTER THE FOLLOWING PRESCRIPTION HAS BECOME FAMOUS IN TEXT BOOKS STRYCHNINAE SULPH GR POTASS BROMIDE VI AQUA AD VIII FIAT MISTURA THIS SOLUTION DEPOSITS IN A FEW HOURS THE GREATER PART OF THE STRYCHNINE SALT AS AN INSOLUBLE BROMIDE IN TRANSPARENT CRYSTALS A LADY IN ENGLAND LOST HER LIFE BY TAKING A SIMILAR MIXTURE THE PRECIPITATED STRYCHNINE COLLECTED AT THE BOTTOM AND IN TAKING THE LAST DOSE SHE SWALLOWED NEARLY ALL OF IT NOW THERE WAS OF COURSE NO BROMIDE IN DR WILKINS PRESCRIPTION BUT YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT I MENTIONED AN EMPTY BOX OF BROMIDE POWDERS ONE OR TWO OF THOSE POWDERS INTRODUCED INTO THE FULL BOTTLE OF MEDICINE WOULD EFFECTUALLY PRECIPITATE THE STRYCHNINE AS THE BOOK DESCRIBES AND CAUSE IT TO BE TAKEN IN THE LAST DOSE YOU WILL LEARN LATER THAT THE PERSON WHO USUALLY POURED OUT MRS INGLETHORPS MEDICINE WAS ALWAYS EXTREMELY CAREFUL NOT TO SHAKE THE BOTTLE BUT TO LEAVE THE SEDIMENT AT THE BOTTOM OF IT UNDISTURBED THROUGHOUT THE CASE THERE HAVE BEEN EVIDENCES THAT THE TRAGEDY WAS INTENDED TO TAKE PLACE ON MONDAY EVENING ON THAT DAY MRS INGLETHORPS BELL WIRE WAS NEATLY CUT AND ON MONDAY EVENING MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA WAS SPENDING THE NIGHT WITH FRIENDS SO THAT MRS INGLETHORP WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE ALONE IN THE RIGHT WING COMPLETELY SHUT OFF FROM HELP OF ANY KIND AND WOULD HAVE DIED IN ALL PROBABILITY BEFORE MEDICAL AID COULD HAVE BEEN SUMMONED BUT IN HER HURRY TO BE IN TIME FOR THE VILLAGE ENTERTAINMENT MRS INGLETHORP FORGOT TO TAKE HER MEDICINE AND THE NEXT DAY SHE LUNCHED AWAY FROM HOME SO THAT THE LASTAND FATALDOSE WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN TWENTYFOUR HOURS LATER THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED BY THE MURDERER AND IT IS OWING TO THAT DELAY THAT THE FINAL PROOFTHE LAST LINK OF THE CHAINIS NOW IN MY HANDS AMID BREATHLESS EXCITEMENT HE HELD OUT THREE THIN STRIPS OF PAPER A LETTER IN THE MURDERERS OWN HANDWRITING MES AMIS HAD IT BEEN A LITTLE CLEARER IN ITS TERMS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MRS INGLETHORP WARNED IN TIME WOULD HAVE ESCAPED AS IT WAS SHE REALIZED HER DANGER BUT NOT THE MANNER OF IT IN THE DEATHLY SILENCE POIROT PIECED TOGETHER THE SLIPS OF PAPER AND CLEARING HIS THROAT READ DEAREST EVELYN YOU WILL BE ANXIOUS AT HEARING NOTHING IT IS ALL RIGHTONLY IT WILL BE TONIGHT INSTEAD OF LAST NIGHT YOU UNDERSTAND THERES A GOOD TIME COMING ONCE THE OLD WOMAN IS DEAD AND OUT OF THE WAY NO ONE CAN POSSIBLY BRING HOME THE CRIME TO ME THAT IDEA OF YOURS ABOUT THE BROMIDES WAS A STROKE OF GENIUS BUT WE MUST BE VERY CIRCUMSPECT A FALSE STEP HERE MY FRIENDS THE LETTER BREAKS OFF DOUBTLESS THE WRITER WAS INTERRUPTED BUT THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION AS TO HIS IDENTITY WE ALL KNOW THIS HANDWRITING AND A HOWL THAT WAS ALMOST A SCREAM BROKE THE SILENCE YOU DEVIL HOW DID YOU GET IT A CHAIR WAS OVERTURNED POIROT SKIPPED NIMBLY ASIDE A QUICK MOVEMENT ON HIS PART AND HIS ASSAILANT FELL WITH A CRASH MESSIEURS MESDAMES SAID POIROT WITH A FLOURISH LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO THE MURDERER MR ALFRED INGLETHORP CHAPTER XIII POIROT EXPLAINS POIROT YOU OLD VILLAIN I SAID IVE HALF A MIND TO STRANGLE YOU WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DECEIVING ME AS YOU HAVE DONE WE WERE SITTING IN THE LIBRARY SEVERAL HECTIC DAYS LAY BEHIND US IN THE ROOM BELOW JOHN AND MARY WERE TOGETHER ONCE MORE WHILE ALFRED INGLETHORP AND MISS HOWARD WERE IN CUSTODY NOW AT LAST I HAD POIROT TO MYSELF AND COULD RELIEVE MY STILL BURNING CURIOSITY POIROT DID NOT ANSWER ME FOR A MOMENT BUT AT LAST HE SAID I DID NOT DECEIVE YOU MON AMI AT MOST I PERMITTED YOU TO DECEIVE YOURSELF YES BUT WHY WELL IT IS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN YOU SEE MY FRIEND YOU HAVE A NATURE SO HONEST AND A COUNTENANCE SO TRANSPARENT THATENFIN TO CONCEAL YOUR FEELINGS IS IMPOSSIBLE IF I HAD TOLD YOU MY IDEAS THE VERY FIRST TIME YOU SAW MR ALFRED INGLETHORP THAT ASTUTE GENTLEMAN WOULD HAVEIN YOUR SO EXPRESSIVE IDIOMSMELT A RAT AND THEN BONJOUR TO OUR CHANCES OF CATCHING HIM I THINK THAT I HAVE MORE DIPLOMACY THAN YOU GIVE ME CREDIT FOR MY FRIEND BESOUGHT POIROT I IMPLORE YOU DO NOT ENRAGE YOURSELF YOUR HELP HAS BEEN OF THE MOST INVALUABLE IT IS BUT THE EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL NATURE THAT YOU HAVE WHICH MADE ME PAUSE WELL I GRUMBLED A LITTLE MOLLIFIED I STILL THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE GIVEN ME A HINT BUT I DID MY FRIEND SEVERAL HINTS YOU WOULD NOT TAKE THEM THINK NOW DID I EVER SAY TO YOU THAT I BELIEVED JOHN CAVENDISH GUILTY DID I NOT ON THE CONTRARY TELL YOU THAT HE WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE ACQUITTED YES BUT AND DID I NOT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS SPEAK OF THE DIFFICULTY OF BRINGING THE MURDERER TO JUSTICE WAS IT NOT PLAIN TO YOU THAT I WAS SPEAKING OF TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PERSONS NO I SAID IT WAS NOT PLAIN TO ME THEN AGAIN CONTINUED POIROT AT THE BEGINNING DID I NOT REPEAT TO YOU SEVERAL TIMES THAT I DIDNT WANT MR INGLETHORP ARRESTED NOW THAT SHOULD HAVE CONVEYED SOMETHING TO YOU DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU SUSPECTED HIM AS LONG AGO AS THAT YES TO BEGIN WITH WHOEVER ELSE MIGHT BENEFIT BY MRS INGLETHORPS DEATH HER HUSBAND WOULD BENEFIT THE MOST THERE WAS NO GETTING AWAY FROM THAT WHEN I WENT UP TO STYLES WITH YOU THAT FIRST DAY I HAD NO IDEA AS TO HOW THE CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED BUT FROM WHAT I KNEW OF MR INGLETHORP I FANCIED THAT IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO FIND ANYTHING TO CONNECT HIM WITH IT WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE CHTEAU I REALIZED AT ONCE THAT IT WAS MRS INGLETHORP WHO HAD BURNT THE WILL AND THERE BY THE WAY YOU CANNOT COMPLAIN MY FRIEND FOR I TRIED MY BEST TO FORCE ON YOU THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT BEDROOM FIRE IN MIDSUMMER YES YES I SAID IMPATIENTLY GO ON WELL MY FRIEND AS I SAY MY VIEWS AS TO MR INGLETHORPS GUILT WERE VERY MUCH SHAKEN THERE WAS IN FACT SO MUCH EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM THAT I WAS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD NOT DONE IT WHEN DID YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND WHEN I FOUND THAT THE MORE EFFORTS I MADE TO CLEAR HIM THE MORE EFFORTS HE MADE TO GET HIMSELF ARRESTED THEN WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT INGLETHORP HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MRS RAIKES AND THAT IN FACT IT WAS JOHN CAVENDISH WHO WAS INTERESTED IN THAT QUARTER I WAS QUITE SURE BUT WHY SIMPLY THIS IF IT HAD BEEN INGLETHORP WHO WAS CARRYING ON AN INTRIGUE WITH MRS RAIKES HIS SILENCE WAS PERFECTLY COMPREHENSIBLE BUT WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS KNOWN ALL OVER THE VILLAGE THAT IT WAS JOHN WHO WAS ATTRACTED BY THE FARMERS PRETTY WIFE HIS SILENCE BORE QUITE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION IT WAS NONSENSE TO PRETEND THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE SCANDAL AS NO POSSIBLE SCANDAL COULD ATTACH TO HIM THIS ATTITUDE OF HIS GAVE ME FURIOUSLY TO THINK AND I WAS SLOWLY FORCED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ALFRED INGLETHORP WANTED TO BE ARRESTED EH BIEN FROM THAT MOMENT I WAS EQUALLY DETERMINED THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE ARRESTED WAIT A MINUTE I DONT SEE WHY HE WISHED TO BE ARRESTED BECAUSE MON AMI IT IS THE LAW OF YOUR COUNTRY THAT A MAN ONCE ACQUITTED CAN NEVER BE TRIED AGAIN FOR THE SAME OFFENCE AHA BUT IT WAS CLEVERHIS IDEA ASSUREDLY HE IS A MAN OF METHOD SEE HERE HE KNEW THAT IN HIS POSITION HE WAS BOUND TO BE SUSPECTED SO HE CONCEIVED THE EXCEEDINGLY CLEVER IDEA OF PREPARING A LOT OF MANUFACTURED EVIDENCE AGAINST HIMSELF HE WISHED TO BE ARRESTED HE WOULD THEN PRODUCE HIS IRREPROACHABLE ALIBIAND HEY PRESTO HE WAS SAFE FOR LIFE BUT I STILL DONT SEE HOW HE MANAGED TO PROVE HIS ALIBI AND YET GO TO THE CHEMISTS SHOP POIROT STARED AT ME IN SURPRISE IS IT POSSIBLE MY POOR FRIEND YOU HAVE NOT YET REALIZED THAT IT WAS MISS HOWARD WHO WENT TO THE CHEMISTS SHOP MISS HOWARD BUT CERTAINLY WHO ELSE IT WAS MOST EASY FOR HER SHE IS OF A GOOD HEIGHT HER VOICE IS DEEP AND MANLY MOREOVER REMEMBER SHE AND INGLETHORP ARE COUSINS AND THERE IS A DISTINCT RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THEM ESPECIALLY IN THEIR GAIT AND BEARING IT WAS SIMPLICITY ITSELF THEY ARE A CLEVER PAIR I AM STILL A LITTLE FOGGED AS TO HOW EXACTLY THE BROMIDE BUSINESS WAS DONE I REMARKED BON I WILL RECONSTRUCT FOR YOU AS FAR AS POSSIBLE I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT MISS HOWARD WAS THE MASTER MIND IN THAT AFFAIR YOU REMEMBER HER ONCE MENTIONING THAT HER FATHER WAS A DOCTOR POSSIBLY SHE DISPENSED HIS MEDICINES FOR HIM OR SHE MAY HAVE TAKEN THE IDEA FROM ONE OF THE MANY BOOKS LYING ABOUT WHEN MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA WAS STUDYING FOR HER EXAM ANYWAY SHE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT THE ADDITION OF A BROMIDE TO A MIXTURE CONTAINING STRYCHNINE WOULD CAUSE THE PRECIPITATION OF THE LATTER PROBABLY THE IDEA CAME TO HER QUITE SUDDENLY MRS INGLETHORP HAD A BOX OF BROMIDE POWDERS WHICH SHE OCCASIONALLY TOOK AT NIGHT WHAT COULD BE EASIER THAN QUIETLY TO DISSOLVE ONE OR MORE OF THOSE POWDERS IN MRS INGLETHORPS LARGE SIZED BOTTLE OF MEDICINE WHEN IT CAME FROM COOTS THE RISK IS PRACTICALLY NIL THE TRAGEDY WILL NOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL NEARLY A FORTNIGHT LATER IF ANYONE HAS SEEN EITHER OF THEM TOUCHING THE MEDICINE THEY WILL HAVE FORGOTTEN IT BY THAT TIME MISS HOWARD WILL HAVE ENGINEERED HER QUARREL AND DEPARTED FROM THE HOUSE THE LAPSE OF TIME AND HER ABSENCE WILL DEFEAT ALL SUSPICION YES IT WAS A CLEVER IDEA IF THEY HAD LEFT IT ALONE IT IS POSSIBLE THE CRIME MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN BROUGHT HOME TO THEM BUT THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED THEY TRIED TO BE TOO CLEVERAND THAT WAS THEIR UNDOING POIROT PUFFED AT HIS TINY CIGARETTE HIS EYES FIXED ON THE CEILING THEY ARRANGED A PLAN TO THROW SUSPICION ON JOHN CAVENDISH BY BUYING STRYCHNINE AT THE VILLAGE CHEMISTS AND SIGNING THE REGISTER IN HIS HANDWRITING ON MONDAY MRS INGLETHORP WILL TAKE THE LAST DOSE OF HER MEDICINE ON MONDAY THEREFORE AT SIX OCLOCK ALFRED INGLETHORP ARRANGES TO BE SEEN BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT A SPOT FAR REMOVED FROM THE VILLAGE MISS HOWARD HAS PREVIOUSLY MADE UP A COCK AND BULL STORY ABOUT HIM AND MRS RAIKES TO ACCOUNT FOR HIS HOLDING HIS TONGUE AFTERWARDS AT SIX OCLOCK MISS HOWARD DISGUISED AS ALFRED INGLETHORP ENTERS THE CHEMISTS SHOP WITH HER STORY ABOUT A DOG OBTAINS THE STRYCHNINE AND WRITES THE NAME OF ALFRED INGLETHORP IN JOHNS HANDWRITING WHICH SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY STUDIED CAREFULLY BUT AS IT WILL NEVER DO IF JOHN TOO CAN PROVE AN ALIBI SHE WRITES HIM AN ANONYMOUS NOTESTILL COPYING HIS HANDWRITINGWHICH TAKES HIM TO A REMOTE SPOT WHERE IT IS EXCEEDINGLY UNLIKELY THAT ANYONE WILL SEE HIM SO FAR ALL GOES WELL MISS HOWARD GOES BACK TO MIDDLINGHAM ALFRED INGLETHORP RETURNS TO STYLES THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN COMPROMISE HIM IN ANY WAY SINCE IT IS MISS HOWARD WHO HAS THE STRYCHNINE WHICH AFTER ALL IS ONLY WANTED AS A BLIND TO THROW SUSPICION ON JOHN CAVENDISH BUT NOW A HITCH OCCURS MRS INGLETHORP DOES NOT TAKE HER MEDICINE THAT NIGHT THE BROKEN BELL CYNTHIAS ABSENCEARRANGED BY INGLETHORP THROUGH HIS WIFEALL THESE ARE WASTED AND THENHE MAKES HIS SLIP MRS INGLETHORP IS OUT AND HE SITS DOWN TO WRITE TO HIS ACCOMPLICE WHO HE FEARS MAY BE IN A PANIC AT THE NONSUCCESS OF THEIR PLAN IT IS PROBABLE THAT MRS INGLETHORP RETURNED EARLIER THAN HE EXPECTED CAUGHT IN THE ACT AND SOMEWHAT FLURRIED HE HASTILY SHUTS AND LOCKS HIS DESK HE FEARS THAT IF HE REMAINS IN THE ROOM HE MAY HAVE TO OPEN IT AGAIN AND THAT MRS INGLETHORP MIGHT CATCH SIGHT OF THE LETTER BEFORE HE COULD SNATCH IT UP SO HE GOES OUT AND WALKS IN THE WOODS LITTLE DREAMING THAT MRS INGLETHORP WILL OPEN HIS DESK AND DISCOVER THE INCRIMINATING DOCUMENT BUT THIS AS WE KNOW IS WHAT HAPPENED MRS INGLETHORP READS IT AND BECOMES AWARE OF THE PERFIDY OF HER HUSBAND AND EVELYN HOWARD THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY THE SENTENCE ABOUT THE BROMIDES CONVEYS NO WARNING TO HER MIND SHE KNOWS THAT SHE IS IN DANGERBUT IS IGNORANT OF WHERE THE DANGER LIES SHE DECIDES TO SAY NOTHING TO HER HUSBAND BUT SITS DOWN AND WRITES TO HER SOLICITOR ASKING HIM TO COME ON THE MORROW AND SHE ALSO DETERMINES TO DESTROY IMMEDIATELY THE WILL WHICH SHE HAS JUST MADE SHE KEEPS THE FATAL LETTER IT WAS TO DISCOVER THAT LETTER THEN THAT HER HUSBAND FORCED THE LOCK OF THE DESPATCHCASE YES AND FROM THE ENORMOUS RISK HE RAN WE CAN SEE HOW FULLY HE REALIZED ITS IMPORTANCE THAT LETTER EXCEPTED THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO CONNECT HIM WITH THE CRIME THERES ONLY ONE THING I CANT MAKE OUT WHY DIDNT HE DESTROY IT AT ONCE WHEN HE GOT HOLD OF IT BECAUSE HE DID NOT DARE TAKE THE BIGGEST RISK OF ALLTHAT OF KEEPING IT ON HIS OWN PERSON I DONT UNDERSTAND LOOK AT IT FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE ONLY FIVE SHORT MINUTES IN WHICH HE COULD HAVE TAKEN ITTHE FIVE MINUTES IMMEDIATELY BEFORE OUR OWN ARRIVAL ON THE SCENE FOR BEFORE THAT TIME ANNIE WAS BRUSHING THE STAIRS AND WOULD HAVE SEEN ANYONE WHO PASSED GOING TO THE RIGHT WING FIGURE TO YOURSELF THE SCENE HE ENTERS THE ROOM UNLOCKING THE DOOR BY MEANS OF ONE OF THE OTHER DOORKEYSTHEY WERE ALL MUCH ALIKE HE HURRIES TO THE DESPATCHCASEIT IS LOCKED AND THE KEYS ARE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN THAT IS A TERRIBLE BLOW TO HIM FOR IT MEANS THAT HIS PRESENCE IN THE ROOM CANNOT BE CONCEALED AS HE HAD HOPED BUT HE SEES CLEARLY THAT EVERYTHING MUST BE RISKED FOR THE SAKE OF THAT DAMNING PIECE OF EVIDENCE QUICKLY HE FORCES THE LOCK WITH A PENKNIFE AND TURNS OVER THE PAPERS UNTIL HE FINDS WHAT HE IS LOOKING FOR BUT NOW A FRESH DILEMMA ARISES HE DARE NOT KEEP THAT PIECE OF PAPER ON HIM HE MAY BE SEEN LEAVING THE ROOMHE MAY BE SEARCHED IF THE PAPER IS FOUND ON HIM IT IS CERTAIN DOOM PROBABLY AT THIS MINUTE TOO HE HEARS THE SOUNDS BELOW OF MR WELLS AND JOHN LEAVING THE BOUDOIR HE MUST ACT QUICKLY WHERE CAN HE HIDE THIS TERRIBLE SLIP OF PAPER THE CONTENTS OF THE WASTEPAPERBASKET ARE KEPT AND IN ANY CASE ARE SURE TO BE EXAMINED THERE ARE NO MEANS OF DESTROYING IT AND HE DARE NOT KEEP IT HE LOOKS ROUND AND HE SEESWHAT DO YOU THINK MON AMI I SHOOK MY HEAD IN A MOMENT HE HAS TORN THE LETTER INTO LONG THIN STRIPS AND ROLLING THEM UP INTO SPILLS HE THRUSTS THEM HURRIEDLY IN AMONGST THE OTHER SPILLS IN THE VASE ON THE MANTLEPIECE I UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION NO ONE WOULD THINK OF LOOKING THERE POIROT CONTINUED AND HE WILL BE ABLE AT HIS LEISURE TO COME BACK AND DESTROY THIS SOLITARY PIECE OF EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM THEN ALL THE TIME IT WAS IN THE SPILL VASE IN MRS INGLETHORPS BEDROOM UNDER OUR VERY NOSES I CRIED POIROT NODDED YES MY FRIEND THAT IS WHERE I DISCOVERED MY LAST LINK AND I OWE THAT VERY FORTUNATE DISCOVERY TO YOU TO ME YES DO YOU REMEMBER TELLING ME THAT MY HAND SHOOK AS I WAS STRAIGHTENING THE ORNAMENTS ON THE MANTELPIECE YES BUT I DONT SEE NO BUT I SAW DO YOU KNOW MY FRIEND I REMEMBERED THAT EARLIER IN THE MORNING WHEN WE HAD BEEN THERE TOGETHER I HAD STRAIGHTENED ALL THE OBJECTS ON THE MANTELPIECE AND IF THEY WERE ALREADY STRAIGHTENED THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO STRAIGHTEN THEM AGAIN UNLESS IN THE MEANTIME SOMEONE ELSE HAD TOUCHED THEM DEAR ME I MURMURED SO THAT IS THE EXPLANATION OF YOUR EXTRAORDINARY BEHAVIOUR YOU RUSHED DOWN TO STYLES AND FOUND IT STILL THERE YES AND IT WAS A RACE FOR TIME BUT I STILL CANT UNDERSTAND WHY INGLETHORP WAS SUCH A FOOL AS TO LEAVE IT THERE WHEN HE HAD PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO DESTROY IT AH BUT HE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY I SAW TO THAT YOU YES DO YOU REMEMBER REPROVING ME FOR TAKING THE HOUSEHOLD INTO MY CONFIDENCE ON THE SUBJECT YES WELL MY FRIEND I SAW THERE WAS JUST ONE CHANCE I WAS NOT SURE THEN IF INGLETHORP WAS THE CRIMINAL OR NOT BUT IF HE WAS I REASONED THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE THE PAPER ON HIM BUT WOULD HAVE HIDDEN IT SOMEWHERE AND BY ENLISTING THE SYMPATHY OF THE HOUSEHOLD I COULD EFFECTUALLY PREVENT HIS DESTROYING IT HE WAS ALREADY UNDER SUSPICION AND BY MAKING THE MATTER PUBLIC I SECURED THE SERVICES OF ABOUT TEN AMATEUR DETECTIVES WHO WOULD BE WATCHING HIM UNCEASINGLY AND BEING HIMSELF AWARE OF THEIR WATCHFULNESS HE WOULD NOT DARE SEEK FURTHER TO DESTROY THE DOCUMENT HE WAS THEREFORE FORCED TO DEPART FROM THE HOUSE LEAVING IT IN THE SPILL VASE BUT SURELY MISS HOWARD HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES OF AIDING HIM YES BUT MISS HOWARD DID NOT KNOW OF THE PAPERS EXISTENCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PREARRANGED PLAN SHE NEVER SPOKE TO ALFRED INGLETHORP THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DEADLY ENEMIES AND UNTIL JOHN CAVENDISH WAS SAFELY CONVICTED THEY NEITHER OF THEM DARED RISK A MEETING OF COURSE I HAD A WATCH KEPT ON MR INGLETHORP HOPING THAT SOONER OR LATER HE WOULD LEAD ME TO THE HIDINGPLACE BUT HE WAS TOO CLEVER TO TAKE ANY CHANCES THE PAPER WAS SAFE WHERE IT WAS SINCE NO ONE HAD THOUGHT OF LOOKING THERE IN THE FIRST WEEK IT WAS NOT LIKELY THEY WOULD DO SO AFTERWARDS BUT FOR YOUR LUCKY REMARK WE MIGHT NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BRING HIM TO JUSTICE I UNDERSTAND THAT NOW BUT WHEN DID YOU FIRST BEGIN TO SUSPECT MISS HOWARD WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT SHE HAD TOLD A LIE AT THE INQUEST ABOUT THE LETTER SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM MRS INGLETHORP WHY WHAT WAS THERE TO LIE ABOUT YOU SAW THAT LETTER DO YOU RECALL ITS GENERAL APPEARANCE YESMORE OR LESS YOU WILL RECOLLECT THEN THAT MRS INGLETHORP WROTE A VERY DISTINCTIVE HAND AND LEFT LARGE CLEAR SPACES BETWEEN HER WORDS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATE AT THE TOP OF THE LETTER YOU WILL NOTICE THAT JULY TH IS QUITE DIFFERENT IN THIS RESPECT DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN NO I CONFESSED I DONT YOU DO NOT SEE THAT THAT LETTER WAS NOT WRITTEN ON THE TH BUT ON THE THTHE DAY AFTER MISS HOWARDS DEPARTURE THE WAS WRITTEN IN BEFORE THE TO TURN IT INTO THE TH BUT WHY THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I ASKED MYSELF WHY DOES MISS HOWARD SUPPRESS THE LETTER WRITTEN ON THE TH AND PRODUCE THIS FAKED ONE INSTEAD BECAUSE SHE DID NOT WISH TO SHOW THE LETTER OF THE TH WHY AGAIN AND AT ONCE A SUSPICION DAWNED IN MY MIND YOU WILL REMEMBER MY SAYING THAT IT WAS WISE TO BEWARE OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT TELLING YOU THE TRUTH AND YET I CRIED INDIGNANTLY AFTER THAT YOU GAVE ME TWO REASONS WHY MISS HOWARD COULD NOT HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME AND VERY GOOD REASONS TOO REPLIED POIROT FOR A LONG TIME THEY WERE A STUMBLINGBLOCK TO ME UNTIL I REMEMBERED A VERY SIGNIFICANT FACT THAT SHE AND ALFRED INGLETHORP WERE COUSINS SHE COULD NOT HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME SINGLEHANDED BUT THE REASONS AGAINST THAT DID NOT DEBAR HER FROM BEING AN ACCOMPLICE AND THEN THERE WAS THAT RATHER OVERVEHEMENT HATRED OF HERS IT CONCEALED A VERY OPPOSITE EMOTION THERE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A TIE OF PASSION BETWEEN THEM LONG BEFORE HE CAME TO STYLES THEY HAD ALREADY ARRANGED THEIR INFAMOUS PLOTTHAT HE SHOULD MARRY THIS RICH BUT RATHER FOOLISH OLD LADY INDUCE HER TO MAKE A WILL LEAVING HER MONEY TO HIM AND THEN GAIN THEIR ENDS BY A VERY CLEVERLY CONCEIVED CRIME IF ALL HAD GONE AS THEY PLANNED THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LEFT ENGLAND AND LIVED TOGETHER ON THEIR POOR VICTIMS MONEY THEY ARE A VERY ASTUTE AND UNSCRUPULOUS PAIR WHILE SUSPICION WAS TO BE DIRECTED AGAINST HIM SHE WOULD BE MAKING QUIET PREPARATIONS FOR A VERY DIFFERENT DNOUEMENT SHE ARRIVES FROM MIDDLINGHAM WITH ALL THE COMPROMISING ITEMS IN HER POSSESSION NO SUSPICION ATTACHES TO HER NO NOTICE IS PAID TO HER COMING AND GOING IN THE HOUSE SHE HIDES THE STRYCHNINE AND GLASSES IN JOHNS ROOM SHE PUTS THE BEARD IN THE ATTIC SHE WILL SEE TO IT THAT SOONER OR LATER THEY ARE DULY DISCOVERED I DONT QUITE SEE WHY THEY TRIED TO FIX THE BLAME ON JOHN I REMARKED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO BRING THE CRIME HOME TO LAWRENCE YES BUT THAT WAS MERE CHANCE ALL THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM AROSE OUT OF PURE ACCIDENT IT MUST IN FACT HAVE BEEN DISTINCTLY ANNOYING TO THE PAIR OF SCHEMERS HIS MANNER WAS UNFORTUNATE I OBSERVED THOUGHTFULLY YES YOU REALIZE OF COURSE WHAT WAS AT THE BACK OF THAT NO YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT HE BELIEVED MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA GUILTY OF THE CRIME NO I EXCLAIMED ASTONISHED IMPOSSIBLE NOT AT ALL I MYSELF NEARLY HAD THE SAME IDEA IT WAS IN MY MIND WHEN I ASKED MR WELLS THAT FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE WILL THEN THERE WERE THE BROMIDE POWDERS WHICH SHE HAD MADE UP AND HER CLEVER MALE IMPERSONATIONS AS DORCAS RECOUNTED THEM TO US THERE WAS REALLY MORE EVIDENCE AGAINST HER THAN ANYONE ELSE YOU ARE JOKING POIROT NO SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT MADE MONSIEUR LAWRENCE TURN SO PALE WHEN HE FIRST ENTERED HIS MOTHERS ROOM ON THE FATAL NIGHT IT WAS BECAUSE WHILST HIS MOTHER LAY THERE OBVIOUSLY POISONED HE SAW OVER YOUR SHOULDER THAT THE DOOR INTO MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIAS ROOM WAS UNBOLTED BUT HE DECLARED THAT HE SAW IT BOLTED I CRIED EXACTLY SAID POIROT DRYLY AND THAT WAS JUST WHAT CONFIRMED MY SUSPICION THAT IT WAS NOT HE WAS SHIELDING MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA BUT WHY SHOULD HE SHIELD HER BECAUSE HE IS IN LOVE WITH HER I LAUGHED THERE POIROT YOU ARE QUITE WRONG I HAPPEN TO KNOW FOR A FACT THAT FAR FROM BEING IN LOVE WITH HER HE POSITIVELY DISLIKES HER WHO TOLD YOU THAT MON AMI CYNTHIA HERSELF LA PAUVRE PETITE AND SHE WAS CONCERNED SHE SAID THAT SHE DID NOT MIND AT ALL THEN SHE CERTAINLY DID MIND VERY MUCH REMARKED POIROT THEY ARE LIKE THATLES FEMMES WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT LAWRENCE IS A GREAT SURPRISE TO ME I SAID BUT WHY IT WAS MOST OBVIOUS DID NOT MONSIEUR LAWRENCE MAKE THE SOUR FACE EVERY TIME MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA SPOKE AND LAUGHED WITH HIS BROTHER HE HAD TAKEN IT INTO HIS LONG HEAD THAT MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA WAS IN LOVE WITH MONSIEUR JOHN WHEN HE ENTERED HIS MOTHERS ROOM AND SAW HER OBVIOUSLY POISONED HE JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MADEMOISELLE CYNTHIA KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THE MATTER HE WAS NEARLY DRIVEN DESPERATE FIRST HE CRUSHED THE COFFEECUP TO POWDER UNDER HIS FEET REMEMBERING THAT SHE HAD GONE UP WITH HIS MOTHER THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HE DETERMINED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO CHANCE OF TESTING ITS CONTENTS THENCEFORWARD HE STRENUOUSLY AND QUITE USELESSLY UPHELD THE THEORY OF DEATH FROM NATURAL CAUSES AND WHAT ABOUT THE EXTRA COFFEECUP I WAS FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT IT WAS MRS CAVENDISH WHO HAD HIDDEN IT BUT I HAD TO MAKE SURE MONSIEUR LAWRENCE DID NOT KNOW AT ALL WHAT I MEANT BUT ON REFLECTION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF HE COULD FIND AN EXTRA COFFEECUP ANYWHERE HIS LADY LOVE WOULD BE CLEARED OF SUSPICION AND HE WAS PERFECTLY RIGHT ONE THING MORE WHAT DID MRS INGLETHORP MEAN BY HER DYING WORDS THEY WERE OF COURSE AN ACCUSATION AGAINST HER HUSBAND DEAR ME POIROT I SAID WITH A SIGH I THINK YOU HAVE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING I AM GLAD IT HAS ALL ENDED SO HAPPILY EVEN JOHN AND HIS WIFE ARE RECONCILED THANKS TO ME HOW DO YOU MEANTHANKS TO YOU MY DEAR FRIEND DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS SIMPLY AND SOLELY THE TRIAL WHICH HAS BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER AGAIN THAT JOHN CAVENDISH STILL LOVED HIS WIFE I WAS CONVINCED ALSO THAT SHE WAS EQUALLY IN LOVE WITH HIM BUT THEY HAD DRIFTED VERY FAR APART IT ALL AROSE FROM A MISUNDERSTANDING SHE MARRIED HIM WITHOUT LOVE HE KNEW IT HE IS A SENSITIVE MAN IN HIS WAY HE WOULD NOT FORCE HIMSELF UPON HER IF SHE DID NOT WANT HIM AND AS HE WITHDREW HER LOVE AWOKE BUT THEY ARE BOTH UNUSUALLY PROUD AND THEIR PRIDE HELD THEM INEXORABLY APART HE DRIFTED INTO AN ENTANGLEMENT WITH MRS RAIKES AND SHE DELIBERATELY CULTIVATED THE FRIENDSHIP OF DR BAUERSTEIN DO YOU REMEMBER THE DAY OF JOHN CAVENDISHS ARREST WHEN YOU FOUND ME DELIBERATING OVER A BIG DECISION YES I QUITE UNDERSTOOD YOUR DISTRESS PARDON ME MON AMI BUT YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT IN THE LEAST I WAS TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD CLEAR JOHN CAVENDISH AT ONCE I COULD HAVE CLEARED HIMTHOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE MEANT A FAILURE TO CONVICT THE REAL CRIMINALS THEY WERE ENTIRELY IN THE DARK AS TO MY REAL ATTITUDE UP TO THE VERY LAST MOMENTWHICH PARTLY ACCOUNTS FOR MY SUCCESS DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU COULD HAVE SAVED JOHN CAVENDISH FROM BEING BROUGHT TO TRIAL YES MY FRIEND BUT I EVENTUALLY DECIDED IN FAVOUR OF A WOMANS HAPPINESS NOTHING BUT THE GREAT DANGER THROUGH WHICH THEY HAVE PASSED COULD HAVE BROUGHT THESE TWO PROUD SOULS TOGETHER AGAIN I LOOKED AT POIROT IN SILENT AMAZEMENT THE COLOSSAL CHEEK OF THE LITTLE MAN WHO ON EARTH BUT POIROT WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF A TRIAL FOR MURDER AS A RESTORER OF CONJUGAL HAPPINESS I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS MON AMI SAID POIROT SMILING AT ME NO ONE BUT HERCULE POIROT WOULD HAVE ATTEMPTED SUCH A THING AND YOU ARE WRONG IN CONDEMNING IT THE HAPPINESS OF ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN IS THE GREATEST THING IN ALL THE WORLD HIS WORDS TOOK ME BACK TO EARLIER EVENTS I REMEMBERED MARY AS SHE LAY WHITE AND EXHAUSTED ON THE SOFA LISTENING LISTENING THERE HAD COME THE SOUND OF THE BELL BELOW SHE HAD STARTED UP POIROT HAD OPENED THE DOOR AND MEETING HER AGONIZED EYES HAD NODDED GENTLY YES MADAME HE SAID I HAVE BROUGHT HIM BACK TO YOU HE HAD STOOD ASIDE AND AS I WENT OUT I HAD SEEN THE LOOK IN MARYS EYES AS JOHN CAVENDISH HAD CAUGHT HIS WIFE IN HIS ARMS PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT POIROT I SAID GENTLY YES IT IS THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD SUDDENLY THERE WAS A TAP AT THE DOOR AND CYNTHIA PEEPED IN II ONLY COME IN I SAID SPRINGING UP SHE CAME IN BUT DID NOT SIT DOWN IONLY WANTED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING YES CYNTHIA FIDGETED WITH A LITTLE TASSEL FOR SOME MOMENTS THEN SUDDENLY EXCLAIMING YOU DEARS KISSED FIRST ME AND THEN POIROT AND RUSHED OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN WHAT ON EARTH DOES THIS MEAN I ASKED SURPRISED IT WAS VERY NICE TO BE KISSED BY CYNTHIA BUT THE PUBLICITY OF THE SALUTE RATHER IMPAIRED THE PLEASURE IT MEANS THAT SHE HAS DISCOVERED MONSIEUR LAWRENCE DOES NOT DISLIKE HER AS MUCH AS SHE THOUGHT REPLIED POIROT PHILOSOPHICALLY BUT HERE HE IS LAWRENCE AT THAT MOMENT PASSED THE DOOR EH MONSIEUR LAWRENCE CALLED POIROT WE MUST CONGRATULATE YOU IS IT NOT SO LAWRENCE BLUSHED AND THEN SMILED AWKWARDLY A MAN IN LOVE IS A SORRY SPECTACLE NOW CYNTHIA HAD LOOKED CHARMING I SIGHED WHAT IS IT MON AMI NOTHING I SAID SADLY THEY ARE TWO DELIGHTFUL WOMEN AND NEITHER OF THEM IS FOR YOU FINISHED POIROT NEVER MIND
