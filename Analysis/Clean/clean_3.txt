SPIRITS STAVE III THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS STAVE IV THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS STAVE V THE END OF IT STAVE I MARLEYS GHOST MARLEY WAS DEAD TO BEGIN WITH THERE IS NO DOUBT WHATEVER ABOUT THAT THE REGISTER OF HIS BURIAL WAS SIGNED BY THE CLERGYMAN THE CLERK THE UNDERTAKER AND THE CHIEF MOURNER SCROOGE SIGNED IT AND SCROOGES NAME WAS GOOD UPON CHANGE FOR ANYTHING HE CHOSE TO PUT HIS HAND TO OLD MARLEY WAS AS DEAD AS A DOORNAIL MIND I DONT MEAN TO SAY THAT I KNOW OF MY OWN KNOWLEDGE WHAT THERE IS PARTICULARLY DEAD ABOUT A DOORNAIL I MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCLINED MYSELF TO REGARD A COFFINNAIL AS THE DEADEST PIECE OF IRONMONGERY IN THE TRADE BUT THE WISDOM OF OUR ANCESTORS IS IN THE SIMILE AND MY UNHALLOWED HANDS SHALL NOT DISTURB IT OR THE COUNTRYS DONE FOR YOU WILL THEREFORE PERMIT ME TO REPEAT EMPHATICALLY THAT MARLEY WAS AS DEAD AS A DOORNAIL SCROOGE KNEW HE WAS DEAD OF COURSE HE DID HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE SCROOGE AND HE WERE PARTNERS FOR I DONT KNOW HOW MANY YEARS SCROOGE WAS HIS SOLE EXECUTOR HIS SOLE ADMINISTRATOR HIS SOLE ASSIGN HIS SOLE RESIDUARY LEGATEE HIS SOLE FRIEND AND SOLE MOURNER AND EVEN SCROOGE WAS NOT SO DREADFULLY CUT UP BY THE SAD EVENT BUT THAT HE WAS AN EXCELLENT MAN OF BUSINESS ON THE VERY DAY OF THE FUNERAL AND SOLEMNISED IT WITH AN UNDOUBTED BARGAIN THE MENTION OF MARLEYS FUNERAL BRINGS ME BACK TO THE POINT I STARTED FROM THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MARLEY WAS DEAD THIS MUST BE DISTINCTLY UNDERSTOOD OR NOTHING WONDERFUL CAN COME OF THE STORY I AM GOING TO RELATE IF WE WERE NOT PERFECTLY CONVINCED THAT HAMLETS FATHER DIED BEFORE THE PLAY BEGAN THERE WOULD BE NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE IN HIS TAKING A STROLL AT NIGHT IN AN EASTERLY WIND UPON HIS OWN RAMPARTS THAN THERE WOULD BE IN ANY OTHER MIDDLEAGED GENTLEMAN RASHLY TURNING OUT AFTER DARK IN A BREEZY SPOTSAY SAINT PAULS CHURCHYARD FOR INSTANCE LITERALLY TO ASTONISH HIS SONS WEAK MIND SCROOGE NEVER PAINTED OUT OLD MARLEYS NAME THERE IT STOOD YEARS AFTERWARDS ABOVE THE WAREHOUSE DOOR SCROOGE AND MARLEY THE FIRM WAS KNOWN AS SCROOGE AND MARLEY SOMETIMES PEOPLE NEW TO THE BUSINESS CALLED SCROOGE SCROOGE AND SOMETIMES MARLEY BUT HE ANSWERED TO BOTH NAMES IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM OH BUT HE WAS A TIGHTFISTED HAND AT THE GRINDSTONE SCROOGE A SQUEEZING WRENCHING GRASPING SCRAPING CLUTCHING COVETOUS OLD SINNER HARD AND SHARP AS FLINT FROM WHICH NO STEEL HAD EVER STRUCK OUT GENEROUS FIRE SECRET AND SELFCONTAINED AND SOLITARY AS AN OYSTER THE COLD WITHIN HIM FROZE HIS OLD FEATURES NIPPED HIS POINTED NOSE SHRIVELLED HIS CHEEK STIFFENED HIS GAIT MADE HIS EYES RED HIS THIN LIPS BLUE AND SPOKE OUT SHREWDLY IN HIS GRATING VOICE A FROSTY RIME WAS ON HIS HEAD AND ON HIS EYEBROWS AND HIS WIRY CHIN HE CARRIED HIS OWN LOW TEMPERATURE ALWAYS ABOUT WITH HIM HE ICED HIS OFFICE IN THE DOGDAYS AND DIDNT THAW IT ONE DEGREE AT CHRISTMAS EXTERNAL HEAT AND COLD HAD LITTLE INFLUENCE ON SCROOGE NO WARMTH COULD WARM NO WINTRY WEATHER CHILL HIM NO WIND THAT BLEW WAS BITTERER THAN HE NO FALLING SNOW WAS MORE INTENT UPON ITS PURPOSE NO PELTING RAIN LESS OPEN TO ENTREATY FOUL WEATHER DIDNT KNOW WHERE TO HAVE HIM THE HEAVIEST RAIN AND SNOW AND HAIL AND SLEET COULD BOAST OF THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM IN ONLY ONE RESPECT THEY OFTEN CAME DOWN HANDSOMELY AND SCROOGE NEVER DID NOBODY EVER STOPPED HIM IN THE STREET TO SAY WITH GLADSOME LOOKS MY DEAR SCROOGE HOW ARE YOU WHEN WILL YOU COME TO SEE ME NO BEGGARS IMPLORED HIM TO BESTOW A TRIFLE NO CHILDREN ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS OCLOCK NO MAN OR WOMAN EVER ONCE IN ALL HIS LIFE INQUIRED THE WAY TO SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE OF SCROOGE EVEN THE BLIND MENS DOGS APPEARED TO KNOW HIM AND WHEN THEY SAW HIM COMING ON WOULD TUG THEIR OWNERS INTO DOORWAYS AND UP COURTS AND THEN WOULD WAG THEIR TAILS AS THOUGH THEY SAID NO EYE AT ALL IS BETTER THAN AN EVIL EYE DARK MASTER BUT WHAT DID SCROOGE CARE IT WAS THE VERY THING HE LIKED TO EDGE HIS WAY ALONG THE CROWDED PATHS OF LIFE WARNING ALL HUMAN SYMPATHY TO KEEP ITS DISTANCE WAS WHAT THE KNOWING ONES CALL NUTS TO SCROOGE ONCE UPON A TIMEOF ALL THE GOOD DAYS IN THE YEAR ON CHRISTMAS EVEOLD SCROOGE SAT BUSY IN HIS COUNTINGHOUSE IT WAS COLD BLEAK BITING WEATHER FOGGY WITHAL AND HE COULD HEAR THE PEOPLE IN THE COURT OUTSIDE GO WHEEZING UP AND DOWN BEATING THEIR HANDS UPON THEIR BREASTS AND STAMPING THEIR FEET UPON THE PAVEMENT STONES TO WARM THEM THE CITY CLOCKS HAD ONLY JUST GONE THREE BUT IT WAS QUITE DARK ALREADY IT HAD NOT BEEN LIGHT ALL DAYAND CANDLES WERE FLARING IN THE WINDOWS OF THE NEIGHBOURING OFFICES LIKE RUDDY SMEARS UPON THE PALPABLE BROWN AIR THE FOG CAME POURING IN AT EVERY CHINK AND KEYHOLE AND WAS SO DENSE WITHOUT THAT ALTHOUGH THE COURT WAS OF THE NARROWEST THE HOUSES OPPOSITE WERE MERE PHANTOMS TO SEE THE DINGY CLOUD COME DROOPING DOWN OBSCURING EVERYTHING ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT NATURE LIVED HARD BY AND WAS BREWING ON A LARGE SCALE THE DOOR OF SCROOGES COUNTINGHOUSE WAS OPEN THAT HE MIGHT KEEP HIS EYE UPON HIS CLERK WHO IN A DISMAL LITTLE CELL BEYOND A SORT OF TANK WAS COPYING LETTERS SCROOGE HAD A VERY SMALL FIRE BUT THE CLERKS FIRE WAS SO VERY MUCH SMALLER THAT IT LOOKED LIKE ONE COAL BUT HE COULDNT REPLENISH IT FOR SCROOGE KEPT THE COALBOX IN HIS OWN ROOM AND SO SURELY AS THE CLERK CAME IN WITH THE SHOVEL THE MASTER PREDICTED THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THEM TO PART WHEREFORE THE CLERK PUT ON HIS WHITE COMFORTER AND TRIED TO WARM HIMSELF AT THE CANDLE IN WHICH EFFORT NOT BEING A MAN OF A STRONG IMAGINATION HE FAILED A MERRY CHRISTMAS UNCLE GOD SAVE YOU CRIED A CHEERFUL VOICE IT WAS THE VOICE OF SCROOGES NEPHEW WHO CAME UPON HIM SO QUICKLY THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST INTIMATION HE HAD OF HIS APPROACH BAH SAID SCROOGE HUMBUG HE HAD SO HEATED HIMSELF WITH RAPID WALKING IN THE FOG AND FROST THIS NEPHEW OF SCROOGES THAT HE WAS ALL IN A GLOW HIS

ARE MANY THINGS FROM WHICH I MIGHT HAVE DERIVED GOOD BY WHICH I HAVE NOT PROFITED I DARE SAY RETURNED THE NEPHEW CHRISTMAS AMONG THE REST BUT I AM SURE I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF CHRISTMAS TIME WHEN IT HAS COME ROUNDAPART FROM THE VENERATION DUE TO ITS SACRED NAME AND ORIGIN IF ANYTHING BELONGING TO IT CAN BE APART FROM THATAS A GOOD TIME A KIND FORGIVING CHARITABLE PLEASANT TIME THE ONLY TIME I KNOW OF IN THE LONG CALENDAR OF THE YEAR WHEN MEN AND WOMEN SEEM BY ONE CONSENT TO OPEN THEIR SHUTUP HEARTS FREELY AND TO THINK OF PEOPLE BELOW THEM AS IF THEY REALLY WERE FELLOWPASSENGERS TO THE GRAVE AND NOT ANOTHER RACE OF CREATURES BOUND ON OTHER JOURNEYS AND THEREFORE UNCLE THOUGH IT HAS NEVER PUT A SCRAP OF GOLD OR SILVER IN MY POCKET I BELIEVE THAT IT HAS DONE ME GOOD AND WILL DO ME GOOD AND I SAY GOD BLESS IT THE CLERK IN THE TANK INVOLUNTARILY APPLAUDED BECOMING IMMEDIATELY SENSIBLE OF THE IMPROPRIETY HE POKED THE FIRE AND EXTINGUISHED THE LAST FRAIL SPARK FOR EVER LET ME HEAR ANOTHER SOUND FROM YOU SAID SCROOGE AND YOULL KEEP YOUR CHRISTMAS BY LOSING YOUR SITUATION YOURE QUITE A POWERFUL SPEAKER SIR HE ADDED TURNING TO HIS NEPHEW I WONDER YOU DONT GO INTO PARLIAMENT DONT

NEPHEW OUT HAD LET TWO OTHER PEOPLE IN THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN PLEASANT TO BEHOLD AND NOW STOOD WITH THEIR HATS OFF IN SCROOGES OFFICE THEY HAD BOOKS AND PAPERS IN THEIR HANDS AND BOWED TO HIM SCROOGE AND MARLEYS I BELIEVE SAID ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN REFERRING TO HIS LIST HAVE I THE PLEASURE OF ADDRESSING MR SCROOGE OR MR MARLEY MR MARLEY HAS BEEN DEAD THESE SEVEN YEARS SCROOGE REPLIED HE DIED SEVEN YEARS AGO THIS VERY NIGHT WE HAVE NO DOUBT HIS LIBERALITY IS WELL REPRESENTED BY HIS SURVIVING PARTNER SAID THE GENTLEMAN PRESENTING HIS CREDENTIALS IT CERTAINLY WAS FOR THEY HAD BEEN TWO KINDRED SPIRITS AT THE OMINOUS WORD LIBERALITY SCROOGE FROWNED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD AND HANDED THE CREDENTIALS BACK AT THIS FESTIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR MR SCROOGE SAID THE GENTLEMAN TAKING UP A PEN IT IS MORE THAN USUALLY DESIRABLE THAT WE SHOULD MAKE SOME SLIGHT PROVISION FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE WHO SUFFER GREATLY AT THE PRESENT TIME MANY THOUSANDS ARE IN WANT OF COMMON NECESSARIES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE IN WANT OF COMMON COMFORTS SIR ARE THERE NO PRISONS ASKED SCROOGE PLENTY OF PRISONS SAID THE GENTLEMAN LAYING DOWN THE PEN AGAIN AND THE UNION WORKHOUSES DEMANDED SCROOGE ARE THEY STILL

MIGHT KNOW IT OBSERVED THE GENTLEMAN ITS NOT MY BUSINESS SCROOGE RETURNED ITS ENOUGH FOR A MAN TO UNDERSTAND HIS OWN BUSINESS AND NOT TO INTERFERE WITH OTHER PEOPLES MINE OCCUPIES ME CONSTANTLY GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLEMEN SEEING CLEARLY THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO PURSUE THEIR POINT THE GENTLEMEN WITHDREW SCROOGE RESUMED HIS LABOURS WITH AN IMPROVED OPINION OF HIMSELF AND IN A MORE FACETIOUS TEMPER THAN WAS USUAL WITH HIM MEANWHILE THE FOG AND DARKNESS THICKENED SO THAT PEOPLE RAN ABOUT WITH FLARING LINKS PROFFERING THEIR SERVICES TO GO BEFORE HORSES IN CARRIAGES AND CONDUCT THEM ON THEIR WAY THE ANCIENT TOWER OF A CHURCH WHOSE GRUFF OLD BELL WAS ALWAYS PEEPING SLILY DOWN AT SCROOGE OUT OF A GOTHIC WINDOW IN THE WALL BECAME INVISIBLE AND STRUCK THE HOURS AND QUARTERS IN THE CLOUDS WITH TREMULOUS VIBRATIONS AFTERWARDS AS IF ITS TEETH WERE CHATTERING IN ITS FROZEN HEAD UP THERE THE COLD BECAME INTENSE IN THE MAIN STREET AT THE CORNER OF THE COURT SOME LABOURERS WERE REPAIRING THE GASPIPES AND HAD LIGHTED A GREAT FIRE IN A BRAZIER ROUND WHICH A PARTY OF RAGGED MEN AND BOYS WERE GATHERED WARMING THEIR HANDS AND WINKING THEIR EYES BEFORE THE BLAZE IN RAPTURE THE WATERPLUG BEING LEFT IN SOLITUDE ITS OVERFLOWINGS SULLENLY CONGEALED AND TURNED TO MISANTHROPIC ICE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SHOPS WHERE HOLLY SPRIGS AND BERRIES CRACKLED IN THE LAMP HEAT OF THE WINDOWS MADE PALE FACES RUDDY AS THEY PASSED POULTERERS AND GROCERS TRADES BECAME A SPLENDID JOKE A GLORIOUS PAGEANT WITH WHICH IT WAS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH DULL PRINCIPLES AS BARGAIN AND SALE HAD ANYTHING TO DO THE LORD MAYOR IN THE STRONGHOLD OF THE MIGHTY MANSION HOUSE GAVE ORDERS TO HIS FIFTY COOKS AND BUTLERS TO KEEP CHRISTMAS AS A LORD MAYORS HOUSEHOLD SHOULD AND EVEN THE LITTLE TAILOR WHOM HE HAD FINED FIVE SHILLINGS ON THE PREVIOUS MONDAY FOR BEING DRUNK AND BLOODTHIRSTY IN THE STREETS STIRRED UP TOMORROWS PUDDING IN HIS GARRET WHILE HIS LEAN WIFE AND THE BABY SALLIED OUT TO BUY THE BEEF FOGGIER YET AND COLDER PIERCING SEARCHING BITING COLD IF THE GOOD SAINT DUNSTAN HAD BUT NIPPED THE EVIL SPIRITS NOSE WITH A TOUCH OF SUCH WEATHER AS THAT INSTEAD OF USING HIS FAMILIAR WEAPONS THEN INDEED HE WOULD HAVE ROARED TO LUSTY PURPOSE THE OWNER OF ONE SCANT YOUNG NOSE GNAWED AND MUMBLED BY THE HUNGRY COLD AS BONES ARE GNAWED BY DOGS STOOPED DOWN AT SCROOGES KEYHOLE TO REGALE HIM WITH A CHRISTMAS CAROL BUT AT THE FIRST SOUND OF GOD BLESS YOU MERRY GENTLEMAN MAY NOTHING YOU DISMAY SCROOGE SEIZED THE RULER WITH SUCH ENERGY OF ACTION THAT THE SINGER FLED IN TERROR LEAVING THE KEYHOLE TO THE FOG AND EVEN MORE CONGENIAL FROST AT LENGTH THE HOUR OF SHUTTING UP THE COUNTINGHOUSE ARRIVED WITH AN ILLWILL SCROOGE DISMOUNTED FROM HIS STOOL AND TACITLY ADMITTED THE FACT TO THE EXPECTANT CLERK IN THE TANK WHO INSTANTLY SNUFFED HIS CANDLE OUT AND PUT ON HIS HAT YOULL WANT ALL DAY TOMORROW I SUPPOSE SAID SCROOGE IF QUITE CONVENIENT SIR ITS NOT CONVENIENT SAID SCROOGE AND ITS NOT FAIR IF I WAS TO STOP HALFACROWN FOR IT YOUD THINK YOURSELF ILLUSED ILL BE BOUND THE CLERK SMILED FAINTLY AND YET SAID SCROOGE YOU DONT THINK ME ILLUSED WHEN I PAY A DAYS WAGES FOR NO WORK THE CLERK OBSERVED THAT IT WAS ONLY ONCE A YEAR A POOR EXCUSE FOR PICKING A MANS POCKET EVERY TWENTYFIFTH OF DECEMBER SAID SCROOGE BUTTONING HIS GREATCOAT TO THE CHIN BUT I SUPPOSE YOU MUST HAVE THE WHOLE DAY BE HERE ALL THE EARLIER NEXT MORNING THE CLERK PROMISED THAT HE WOULD AND SCROOGE WALKED OUT WITH A GROWL THE OFFICE WAS CLOSED IN A TWINKLING AND THE CLERK WITH THE LONG ENDS OF HIS WHITE COMFORTER DANGLING BELOW HIS WAIST FOR HE BOASTED NO GREATCOAT WENT DOWN A SLIDE ON CORNHILL AT THE END OF A LANE OF BOYS TWENTY TIMES IN HONOUR OF ITS BEING CHRISTMAS EVE AND THEN RAN HOME TO CAMDEN TOWN AS HARD AS HE COULD PELT TO PLAY AT BLINDMANSBUFF SCROOGE TOOK HIS MELANCHOLY DINNER IN HIS USUAL MELANCHOLY TAVERN AND HAVING READ ALL THE NEWSPAPERS AND BEGUILED THE REST OF THE EVENING WITH HIS BANKERSBOOK WENT HOME TO BED HE LIVED IN CHAMBERS WHICH HAD ONCE BELONGED TO HIS DECEASED PARTNER THEY WERE A GLOOMY SUITE OF ROOMS IN A LOWERING PILE OF BUILDING UP A YARD WHERE IT HAD SO LITTLE BUSINESS TO BE THAT ONE COULD SCARCELY HELP FANCYING IT MUST HAVE RUN THERE WHEN IT WAS A YOUNG HOUSE PLAYING AT HIDEANDSEEK WITH OTHER HOUSES AND FORGOTTEN THE WAY OUT AGAIN IT WAS OLD ENOUGH NOW AND DREARY ENOUGH FOR NOBODY LIVED IN IT BUT SCROOGE THE OTHER ROOMS BEING ALL LET OUT AS OFFICES THE YARD WAS SO DARK THAT EVEN SCROOGE WHO KNEW ITS EVERY STONE WAS FAIN TO GROPE WITH HIS HANDS THE FOG AND FROST SO HUNG ABOUT THE BLACK OLD GATEWAY OF THE HOUSE THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THE GENIUS OF THE WEATHER SAT IN MOURNFUL MEDITATION ON THE THRESHOLD NOW IT IS A FACT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL PARTICULAR ABOUT THE KNOCKER ON THE DOOR EXCEPT THAT IT WAS VERY LARGE IT IS ALSO A FACT THAT SCROOGE HAD SEEN IT NIGHT AND MORNING DURING HIS WHOLE RESIDENCE IN THAT PLACE ALSO THAT SCROOGE HAD AS LITTLE OF WHAT IS CALLED FANCY ABOUT HIM AS ANY MAN IN THE CITY OF LONDON EVEN INCLUDINGWHICH IS A BOLD WORDTHE CORPORATION ALDERMEN AND LIVERY LET IT ALSO BE BORNE IN MIND THAT SCROOGE HAD NOT BESTOWED ONE THOUGHT ON MARLEY SINCE HIS LAST MENTION OF HIS SEVEN YEARS DEAD PARTNER THAT AFTERNOON AND THEN LET ANY MAN EXPLAIN TO ME IF HE CAN HOW IT HAPPENED THAT SCROOGE HAVING HIS KEY IN THE LOCK OF THE DOOR SAW IN THE KNOCKER WITHOUT ITS UNDERGOING ANY INTERMEDIATE PROCESS OF CHANGENOT A KNOCKER BUT MARLEYS FACE MARLEYS FACE IT WAS NOT IN IMPENETRABLE SHADOW AS THE OTHER OBJECTS IN THE YARD WERE BUT HAD A DISMAL LIGHT ABOUT IT LIKE A BAD LOBSTER IN A DARK CELLAR IT WAS NOT ANGRY OR FEROCIOUS BUT LOOKED AT SCROOGE AS MARLEY USED TO LOOK WITH GHOSTLY SPECTACLES TURNED UP ON ITS GHOSTLY FOREHEAD THE HAIR WAS CURIOUSLY STIRRED AS IF BY BREATH OR HOT AIR AND THOUGH THE EYES WERE WIDE OPEN THEY WERE PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS THAT AND ITS LIVID COLOUR MADE IT HORRIBLE BUT ITS HORROR SEEMED TO BE IN SPITE OF THE FACE AND BEYOND ITS CONTROL RATHER THAN A PART OF ITS OWN EXPRESSION AS SCROOGE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT THIS PHENOMENON IT WAS A KNOCKER AGAIN TO SAY THAT HE WAS NOT STARTLED OR THAT HIS BLOOD WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF A TERRIBLE SENSATION TO WHICH IT HAD BEEN A STRANGER FROM INFANCY WOULD BE UNTRUE BUT HE PUT HIS HAND UPON THE KEY HE HAD RELINQUISHED TURNED IT STURDILY WALKED IN AND LIGHTED HIS CANDLE HE DID PAUSE WITH A MOMENTS IRRESOLUTION BEFORE HE SHUT THE DOOR AND HE DID LOOK CAUTIOUSLY BEHIND IT FIRST AS IF HE HALF EXPECTED TO BE TERRIFIED WITH THE SIGHT OF MARLEYS PIGTAIL STICKING OUT INTO THE HALL BUT THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE BACK OF THE DOOR EXCEPT THE SCREWS AND NUTS THAT HELD THE KNOCKER ON SO HE SAID POOH POOH AND CLOSED IT WITH A BANG THE SOUND RESOUNDED THROUGH THE HOUSE LIKE THUNDER EVERY ROOM ABOVE AND EVERY CASK IN THE WINEMERCHANTS CELLARS BELOW APPEARED TO HAVE A SEPARATE PEAL OF ECHOES OF ITS OWN SCROOGE WAS NOT A MAN TO BE FRIGHTENED BY ECHOES HE FASTENED THE DOOR AND WALKED ACROSS THE HALL AND UP THE STAIRS SLOWLY TOO TRIMMING HIS CANDLE AS HE WENT YOU MAY TALK VAGUELY ABOUT DRIVING A COACHANDSIX UP A GOOD OLD FLIGHT OF STAIRS OR THROUGH A BAD YOUNG ACT OF PARLIAMENT BUT I MEAN TO SAY YOU MIGHT HAVE GOT A HEARSE UP THAT STAIRCASE AND TAKEN IT BROADWISE WITH THE SPLINTERBAR TOWARDS THE WALL AND THE DOOR TOWARDS THE BALUSTRADES AND DONE IT EASY THERE WAS PLENTY OF WIDTH FOR THAT AND ROOM TO SPARE WHICH IS PERHAPS THE REASON WHY SCROOGE THOUGHT HE SAW A LOCOMOTIVE HEARSE GOING ON BEFORE HIM IN THE GLOOM HALFADOZEN GASLAMPS OUT OF THE STREET WOULDNT HAVE LIGHTED THE ENTRY TOO WELL SO YOU MAY SUPPOSE THAT IT WAS PRETTY DARK WITH SCROOGES DIP UP SCROOGE WENT NOT CARING A BUTTON FOR THAT DARKNESS IS CHEAP AND SCROOGE LIKED IT BUT BEFORE HE SHUT HIS HEAVY DOOR HE WALKED THROUGH HIS ROOMS TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT HE HAD JUST ENOUGH RECOLLECTION OF THE FACE TO DESIRE TO DO THAT SITTINGROOM BEDROOM LUMBERROOM ALL AS THEY SHOULD BE NOBODY UNDER THE TABLE NOBODY UNDER THE SOFA A SMALL FIRE IN THE GRATE SPOON AND BASIN READY AND THE LITTLE SAUCEPAN OF GRUEL SCROOGE HAD A COLD IN HIS HEAD UPON THE HOB NOBODY UNDER THE BED NOBODY IN THE CLOSET NOBODY IN HIS DRESSINGGOWN WHICH WAS HANGING UP IN A SUSPICIOUS ATTITUDE AGAINST THE WALL LUMBERROOM AS USUAL OLD FIREGUARD OLD SHOES TWO FISHBASKETS WASHINGSTAND ON THREE LEGS AND A POKER QUITE SATISFIED HE CLOSED HIS DOOR AND LOCKED HIMSELF IN DOUBLELOCKED HIMSELF IN WHICH WAS NOT HIS CUSTOM THUS SECURED AGAINST SURPRISE HE TOOK OFF HIS CRAVAT PUT ON HIS DRESSINGGOWN AND SLIPPERS AND HIS NIGHTCAP AND SAT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE TO TAKE HIS GRUEL IT WAS A VERY LOW FIRE INDEED NOTHING ON SUCH A BITTER NIGHT HE WAS OBLIGED TO SIT CLOSE TO IT AND BROOD OVER IT BEFORE HE COULD EXTRACT THE LEAST SENSATION OF WARMTH FROM SUCH A HANDFUL OF FUEL THE FIREPLACE WAS AN OLD ONE BUILT BY SOME DUTCH MERCHANT LONG AGO AND PAVED ALL ROUND WITH QUAINT DUTCH TILES DESIGNED TO ILLUSTRATE THE SCRIPTURES THERE WERE CAINS AND ABELS PHARAOHS DAUGHTERS QUEENS OF SHEBA ANGELIC MESSENGERS DESCENDING THROUGH THE AIR ON CLOUDS LIKE FEATHERBEDS ABRAHAMS BELSHAZZARS APOSTLES PUTTING OFF TO SEA IN BUTTERBOATS HUNDREDS OF FIGURES TO ATTRACT HIS THOUGHTS AND YET THAT FACE OF MARLEY SEVEN YEARS DEAD CAME LIKE THE ANCIENT PROPHETS ROD AND SWALLOWED UP THE WHOLE IF EACH SMOOTH TILE HAD BEEN A BLANK AT FIRST WITH POWER TO SHAPE SOME PICTURE ON ITS SURFACE FROM THE DISJOINTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS THOUGHTS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A COPY OF OLD MARLEYS HEAD ON EVERY ONE HUMBUG SAID SCROOGE AND WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM AFTER SEVERAL TURNS HE SAT DOWN AGAIN AS HE THREW HIS HEAD BACK IN THE CHAIR HIS GLANCE HAPPENED TO REST UPON A BELL A DISUSED BELL THAT HUNG IN THE ROOM AND COMMUNICATED FOR SOME PURPOSE NOW FORGOTTEN WITH A CHAMBER IN THE HIGHEST STORY OF THE BUILDING IT WAS WITH GREAT ASTONISHMENT AND WITH A STRANGE INEXPLICABLE DREAD THAT AS HE LOOKED HE SAW THIS BELL BEGIN TO SWING IT SWUNG SO SOFTLY IN THE OUTSET THAT IT SCARCELY MADE A SOUND BUT SOON IT RANG OUT LOUDLY AND SO DID EVERY BELL IN THE HOUSE THIS MIGHT HAVE LASTED HALF A MINUTE OR A MINUTE BUT IT SEEMED AN HOUR THE BELLS CEASED AS THEY HAD BEGUN TOGETHER THEY WERE SUCCEEDED BY A CLANKING NOISE DEEP DOWN BELOW AS IF SOME PERSON WERE DRAGGING A HEAVY CHAIN OVER THE CASKS IN THE WINEMERCHANTS CELLAR SCROOGE THEN REMEMBERED TO HAVE HEARD THAT GHOSTS IN HAUNTED HOUSES WERE DESCRIBED AS DRAGGING CHAINS THE CELLARDOOR FLEW OPEN WITH A BOOMING SOUND AND THEN HE HEARD THE NOISE MUCH LOUDER ON THE FLOORS BELOW THEN COMING UP THE STAIRS THEN COMING STRAIGHT TOWARDS HIS DOOR ITS HUMBUG STILL SAID SCROOGE I WONT BELIEVE IT HIS COLOUR CHANGED THOUGH WHEN WITHOUT A PAUSE IT CAME ON THROUGH THE HEAVY DOOR AND PASSED INTO THE ROOM BEFORE HIS EYES UPON ITS COMING IN THE DYING FLAME LEAPED UP AS THOUGH IT CRIED I KNOW HIM MARLEYS GHOST AND FELL AGAIN THE SAME FACE THE VERY SAME MARLEY IN HIS PIGTAIL USUAL WAISTCOAT TIGHTS AND BOOTS THE TASSELS ON THE LATTER BRISTLING LIKE HIS PIGTAIL AND HIS COATSKIRTS AND THE HAIR UPON HIS HEAD THE CHAIN HE DREW WAS CLASPED ABOUT HIS MIDDLE IT WAS LONG AND WOUND ABOUT HIM LIKE A TAIL AND IT WAS MADE FOR SCROOGE OBSERVED IT CLOSELY OF CASHBOXES KEYS PADLOCKS LEDGERS DEEDS AND HEAVY PURSES WROUGHT IN STEEL HIS BODY WAS TRANSPARENT SO THAT SCROOGE OBSERVING HIM AND LOOKING THROUGH HIS WAISTCOAT COULD SEE THE TWO BUTTONS ON HIS COAT BEHIND SCROOGE HAD OFTEN HEARD IT SAID THAT MARLEY HAD NO BOWELS BUT HE HAD NEVER BELIEVED IT UNTIL NOW NO NOR DID HE BELIEVE IT EVEN NOW THOUGH HE LOOKED THE PHANTOM THROUGH AND THROUGH AND SAW IT STANDING BEFORE HIM THOUGH HE FELT THE CHILLING INFLUENCE OF ITS DEATHCOLD EYES AND MARKED THE VERY TEXTURE OF THE FOLDED KERCHIEF BOUND ABOUT ITS HEAD AND CHIN WHICH WRAPPER HE HAD NOT OBSERVED BEFORE HE WAS STILL INCREDULOUS AND FOUGHT AGAINST HIS SENSES HOW NOW SAID SCROOGE CAUSTIC AND COLD AS EVER WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME MUCHMARLEYS VOICE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT WHO ARE YOU ASK ME WHO I WAS WHO WERE YOU THEN SAID SCROOGE RAISING HIS VOICE YOURE PARTICULAR FOR A SHADE HE WAS GOING TO SAY TO A SHADE BUT SUBSTITUTED THIS AS MORE APPROPRIATE IN LIFE I WAS YOUR PARTNER JACOB MARLEY CAN YOUCAN YOU SIT DOWN ASKED SCROOGE LOOKING DOUBTFULLY AT HIM I CAN DO IT THEN SCROOGE ASKED THE QUESTION BECAUSE HE DIDNT KNOW WHETHER A GHOST SO TRANSPARENT MIGHT FIND HIMSELF IN A CONDITION TO TAKE A CHAIR AND FELT THAT IN THE EVENT OF ITS BEING IMPOSSIBLE IT MIGHT INVOLVE THE NECESSITY OF AN EMBARRASSING EXPLANATION BUT THE GHOST SAT DOWN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE AS IF HE WERE QUITE USED TO IT YOU DONT BELIEVE IN ME OBSERVED THE GHOST I DONT SAID SCROOGE WHAT EVIDENCE WOULD YOU HAVE OF MY REALITY BEYOND THAT OF YOUR SENSES I DONT KNOW SAID SCROOGE WHY DO YOU DOUBT YOUR SENSES BECAUSE SAID SCROOGE A LITTLE THING AFFECTS THEM A SLIGHT DISORDER OF THE STOMACH MAKES THEM CHEATS YOU MAY BE AN UNDIGESTED BIT OF BEEF A BLOT OF MUSTARD A CRUMB OF CHEESE A FRAGMENT OF AN UNDERDONE POTATO THERES MORE OF GRAVY THAN OF GRAVE ABOUT YOU WHATEVER YOU ARE SCROOGE WAS NOT MUCH IN THE HABIT OF CRACKING JOKES NOR DID HE FEEL IN HIS HEART BY ANY MEANS WAGGISH THEN THE TRUTH IS THAT HE TRIED TO BE SMART AS A MEANS OF DISTRACTING HIS OWN ATTENTION AND KEEPING DOWN HIS TERROR FOR THE SPECTRES VOICE DISTURBED THE VERY MARROW IN HIS BONES TO SIT STARING AT THOSE FIXED GLAZED EYES IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT WOULD PLAY SCROOGE FELT THE VERY DEUCE WITH HIM THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY AWFUL TOO IN THE SPECTRES BEING PROVIDED WITH AN INFERNAL ATMOSPHERE OF ITS OWN SCROOGE COULD NOT FEEL IT HIMSELF BUT THIS WAS CLEARLY THE CASE FOR THOUGH THE GHOST SAT PERFECTLY MOTIONLESS ITS HAIR AND SKIRTS AND TASSELS WERE STILL AGITATED AS BY THE HOT VAPOUR FROM AN OVEN YOU SEE THIS TOOTHPICK SAID SCROOGE RETURNING QUICKLY TO THE CHARGE FOR THE REASON JUST ASSIGNED AND WISHING THOUGH IT WERE ONLY FOR A SECOND TO DIVERT THE VISIONS STONY GAZE FROM HIMSELF I DO REPLIED THE GHOST YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT IT SAID SCROOGE BUT I SEE IT SAID THE GHOST NOTWITHSTANDING WELL RETURNED SCROOGE I HAVE BUT TO SWALLOW THIS AND BE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS PERSECUTED BY A LEGION OF GOBLINS ALL OF MY OWN CREATION HUMBUG I TELL YOU HUMBUG AT THIS THE SPIRIT RAISED A FRIGHTFUL CRY AND SHOOK ITS CHAIN WITH SUCH A DISMAL AND APPALLING NOISE THAT SCROOGE HELD ON TIGHT TO HIS CHAIR TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM FALLING IN A SWOON BUT HOW MUCH GREATER WAS HIS HORROR WHEN THE PHANTOM TAKING OFF THE BANDAGE ROUND ITS HEAD AS IF IT WERE TOO WARM TO WEAR INDOORS ITS LOWER JAW DROPPED DOWN UPON ITS BREAST SCROOGE FELL UPON HIS KNEES AND CLASPED HIS HANDS BEFORE HIS FACE MERCY HE SAID DREADFUL APPARITION WHY DO YOU TROUBLE ME MAN OF THE WORLDLY MIND REPLIED THE GHOST DO YOU BELIEVE IN ME OR NOT I DO SAID SCROOGE I MUST BUT WHY DO SPIRITS WALK THE EARTH AND WHY DO THEY COME TO ME IT IS REQUIRED OF EVERY MAN THE GHOST RETURNED THAT THE SPIRIT WITHIN HIM SHOULD WALK ABROAD AMONG HIS FELLOWMEN AND TRAVEL FAR AND WIDE AND IF THAT SPIRIT GOES NOT FORTH IN LIFE IT IS CONDEMNED TO DO SO AFTER DEATH IT IS DOOMED TO WANDER THROUGH THE WORLDOH WOE IS MEAND WITNESS WHAT IT CANNOT SHARE BUT MIGHT HAVE SHARED ON EARTH AND TURNED TO HAPPINESS AGAIN THE SPECTRE RAISED A CRY AND SHOOK ITS CHAIN AND WRUNG ITS SHADOWY HANDS YOU ARE FETTERED SAID SCROOGE TREMBLING TELL ME WHY I WEAR THE CHAIN I FORGED IN LIFE REPLIED THE GHOST I MADE IT LINK BY LINK AND YARD BY YARD I GIRDED IT ON OF MY OWN FREE WILL AND OF MY OWN FREE WILL I WORE IT IS ITS PATTERN STRANGE TO YOU SCROOGE TREMBLED MORE AND MORE OR WOULD YOU KNOW PURSUED THE GHOST THE WEIGHT AND LENGTH OF THE STRONG COIL YOU BEAR YOURSELF IT WAS FULL AS HEAVY AND AS LONG AS THIS SEVEN CHRISTMAS EVES AGO YOU HAVE LABOURED ON IT SINCE IT IS A PONDEROUS CHAIN SCROOGE GLANCED ABOUT HIM ON THE FLOOR IN THE EXPECTATION OF FINDING HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY FATHOMS OF IRON CABLE BUT HE COULD SEE NOTHING JACOB HE SAID IMPLORINGLY OLD JACOB MARLEY TELL ME MORE SPEAK COMFORT TO ME JACOB I HAVE NONE TO GIVE THE GHOST REPLIED IT COMES FROM OTHER REGIONS EBENEZER SCROOGE AND IS CONVEYED BY OTHER MINISTERS TO OTHER KINDS OF MEN NOR CAN I TELL YOU WHAT I WOULD A VERY LITTLE MORE IS ALL PERMITTED TO ME I CANNOT REST I CANNOT STAY I CANNOT LINGER ANYWHERE MY SPIRIT NEVER WALKED BEYOND OUR COUNTINGHOUSEMARK MEIN LIFE MY SPIRIT NEVER ROVED BEYOND THE NARROW LIMITS OF OUR MONEYCHANGING HOLE AND WEARY JOURNEYS LIE BEFORE ME IT WAS A HABIT WITH SCROOGE WHENEVER HE BECAME THOUGHTFUL TO PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS BREECHES POCKETS PONDERING ON WHAT THE GHOST HAD SAID HE DID SO NOW BUT WITHOUT LIFTING UP HIS EYES OR GETTING OFF HIS KNEES YOU MUST HAVE BEEN VERY SLOW ABOUT IT JACOB SCROOGE OBSERVED IN A BUSINESSLIKE MANNER THOUGH WITH HUMILITY AND DEFERENCE SLOW THE GHOST REPEATED SEVEN YEARS DEAD MUSED SCROOGE AND TRAVELLING ALL THE TIME THE WHOLE TIME SAID THE GHOST NO REST NO PEACE INCESSANT TORTURE OF REMORSE YOU TRAVEL FAST SAID SCROOGE ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND REPLIED THE GHOST YOU MIGHT HAVE GOT OVER A GREAT QUANTITY OF GROUND IN SEVEN YEARS SAID SCROOGE THE GHOST ON HEARING THIS SET UP ANOTHER CRY AND CLANKED ITS CHAIN SO HIDEOUSLY IN THE DEAD SILENCE OF THE NIGHT THAT THE WARD WOULD HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED IN INDICTING IT FOR A NUISANCE OH CAPTIVE BOUND AND DOUBLEIRONED CRIED THE PHANTOM NOT TO KNOW THAT AGES OF INCESSANT LABOUR BY IMMORTAL CREATURES FOR THIS EARTH MUST PASS INTO ETERNITY BEFORE THE GOOD OF WHICH IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE IS ALL DEVELOPED NOT TO KNOW THAT ANY CHRISTIAN SPIRIT WORKING KINDLY IN ITS LITTLE SPHERE WHATEVER IT MAY BE WILL FIND ITS MORTAL LIFE TOO SHORT FOR ITS VAST MEANS OF USEFULNESS NOT TO KNOW THAT NO SPACE OF REGRET CAN MAKE AMENDS FOR ONE LIFES OPPORTUNITY MISUSED YET SUCH WAS I OH SUCH WAS I BUT YOU WERE ALWAYS A GOOD MAN OF BUSINESS JACOB FALTERED SCROOGE WHO NOW BEGAN TO APPLY THIS TO HIMSELF BUSINESS CRIED THE GHOST WRINGING ITS HANDS AGAIN MANKIND WAS MY BUSINESS THE COMMON WELFARE WAS MY BUSINESS CHARITY MERCY FORBEARANCE AND BENEVOLENCE WERE ALL MY BUSINESS THE DEALINGS OF MY TRADE WERE BUT A DROP OF WATER IN THE COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OF MY BUSINESS IT HELD UP ITS CHAIN AT ARMS LENGTH AS IF THAT WERE THE CAUSE OF ALL ITS UNAVAILING GRIEF AND FLUNG IT HEAVILY UPON THE GROUND AGAIN AT THIS TIME OF THE ROLLING YEAR THE SPECTRE SAID I SUFFER MOST WHY DID I WALK THROUGH CROWDS OF FELLOWBEINGS WITH MY EYES TURNED DOWN AND NEVER RAISE THEM TO THAT BLESSED STAR WHICH LED THE WISE MEN TO A POOR ABODE WERE THERE NO POOR HOMES TO WHICH ITS LIGHT WOULD HAVE CONDUCTED ME SCROOGE WAS VERY MUCH DISMAYED TO HEAR THE SPECTRE GOING ON AT THIS RATE AND BEGAN TO QUAKE EXCEEDINGLY HEAR ME CRIED THE GHOST MY TIME IS NEARLY GONE I WILL SAID SCROOGE BUT DONT BE HARD UPON ME DONT BE FLOWERY JACOB PRAY HOW IT IS THAT I APPEAR BEFORE YOU IN A SHAPE THAT YOU CAN SEE I MAY NOT TELL I HAVE SAT INVISIBLE BESIDE YOU MANY AND MANY A DAY IT WAS NOT AN AGREEABLE IDEA SCROOGE SHIVERED AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS BROW THAT IS NO LIGHT PART OF MY PENANCE PURSUED THE GHOST I AM HERE TONIGHT TO WARN YOU THAT YOU HAVE YET A CHANCE AND HOPE OF ESCAPING MY FATE A CHANCE AND HOPE OF MY PROCURING EBENEZER YOU WERE ALWAYS A GOOD FRIEND TO ME SAID SCROOGE THANKEE YOU WILL BE HAUNTED RESUMED THE GHOST BY THREE SPIRITS SCROOGES COUNTENANCE FELL ALMOST AS LOW AS THE GHOSTS HAD DONE IS THAT THE CHANCE AND HOPE YOU MENTIONED JACOB HE DEMANDED IN A FALTERING VOICE IT IS II THINK ID RATHER NOT SAID SCROOGE WITHOUT THEIR VISITS SAID THE GHOST YOU CANNOT HOPE TO SHUN THE PATH I TREAD EXPECT THE FIRST TOMORROW WHEN THE BELL TOLLS ONE COULDNT I TAKE EM ALL AT ONCE AND HAVE IT OVER JACOB HINTED SCROOGE EXPECT THE SECOND ON THE NEXT NIGHT AT THE SAME HOUR THE THIRD UPON THE NEXT NIGHT WHEN THE LAST STROKE OF TWELVE HAS CEASED TO VIBRATE LOOK TO SEE ME NO MORE AND LOOK THAT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAS PASSED BETWEEN US WHEN IT HAD SAID THESE WORDS THE SPECTRE TOOK ITS WRAPPER FROM THE TABLE AND BOUND IT ROUND ITS HEAD AS BEFORE SCROOGE KNEW THIS BY THE SMART SOUND ITS TEETH MADE WHEN THE JAWS WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER BY THE BANDAGE HE VENTURED TO RAISE HIS EYES AGAIN AND FOUND HIS SUPERNATURAL VISITOR CONFRONTING HIM IN AN ERECT ATTITUDE WITH ITS CHAIN WOUND OVER AND ABOUT ITS ARM THE APPARITION WALKED BACKWARD FROM HIM AND AT EVERY STEP IT TOOK THE WINDOW RAISED ITSELF A LITTLE SO THAT WHEN THE SPECTRE REACHED IT IT WAS WIDE OPEN IT BECKONED SCROOGE TO APPROACH WHICH HE DID WHEN THEY WERE WITHIN TWO PACES OF EACH OTHER MARLEYS GHOST HELD UP ITS HAND WARNING HIM TO COME NO NEARER SCROOGE STOPPED NOT SO MUCH IN OBEDIENCE AS IN SURPRISE AND FEAR FOR ON THE RAISING OF THE HAND HE BECAME SENSIBLE OF CONFUSED NOISES IN THE AIR INCOHERENT SOUNDS OF LAMENTATION AND REGRET WAILINGS INEXPRESSIBLY SORROWFUL AND SELFACCUSATORY THE SPECTRE AFTER LISTENING FOR A MOMENT JOINED IN THE MOURNFUL DIRGE AND FLOATED OUT UPON THE BLEAK DARK NIGHT SCROOGE FOLLOWED TO THE WINDOW DESPERATE IN HIS CURIOSITY HE LOOKED OUT THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH PHANTOMS WANDERING HITHER AND THITHER IN RESTLESS HASTE AND MOANING AS THEY WENT EVERY ONE OF THEM WORE CHAINS LIKE MARLEYS GHOST SOME FEW THEY MIGHT BE GUILTY GOVERNMENTS WERE LINKED TOGETHER NONE WERE FREE MANY HAD BEEN PERSONALLY KNOWN TO SCROOGE IN THEIR LIVES HE HAD BEEN QUITE FAMILIAR WITH ONE OLD GHOST IN A WHITE WAISTCOAT WITH A MONSTROUS IRON SAFE ATTACHED TO ITS ANKLE WHO CRIED PITEOUSLY AT BEING UNABLE TO ASSIST A WRETCHED WOMAN WITH AN INFANT WHOM IT SAW BELOW UPON A DOORSTEP THE MISERY WITH THEM ALL WAS CLEARLY THAT THEY SOUGHT TO INTERFERE FOR GOOD IN HUMAN MATTERS AND HAD LOST THE POWER FOR EVER WHETHER THESE CREATURES FADED INTO MIST OR MIST ENSHROUDED THEM HE COULD NOT TELL BUT THEY AND THEIR SPIRIT VOICES FADED TOGETHER AND THE NIGHT BECAME AS IT HAD BEEN WHEN HE WALKED HOME SCROOGE CLOSED THE WINDOW AND EXAMINED THE DOOR BY WHICH THE GHOST HAD ENTERED IT WAS DOUBLELOCKED AS HE HAD LOCKED IT WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND THE BOLTS WERE UNDISTURBED HE TRIED TO SAY HUMBUG BUT STOPPED AT THE FIRST SYLLABLE AND BEING FROM THE EMOTION HE HAD UNDERGONE OR THE FATIGUES OF THE DAY OR HIS GLIMPSE OF THE INVISIBLE WORLD OR THE DULL CONVERSATION OF THE GHOST OR THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR MUCH IN NEED OF REPOSE WENT STRAIGHT TO BED WITHOUT UNDRESSING AND FELL ASLEEP UPON THE INSTANT STAVE II THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS WHEN SCROOGE AWOKE IT WAS SO DARK THAT LOOKING OUT OF BED HE COULD SCARCELY DISTINGUISH THE TRANSPARENT WINDOW FROM THE OPAQUE WALLS OF HIS CHAMBER HE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO PIERCE THE DARKNESS WITH HIS FERRET EYES WHEN THE CHIMES OF A NEIGHBOURING CHURCH STRUCK THE FOUR QUARTERS SO HE LISTENED FOR THE HOUR TO HIS GREAT ASTONISHMENT THE HEAVY BELL WENT ON FROM SIX TO SEVEN AND FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT AND REGULARLY UP TO TWELVE THEN STOPPED TWELVE IT WAS PAST TWO WHEN HE WENT TO BED THE CLOCK WAS WRONG AN ICICLE MUST HAVE GOT INTO THE WORKS TWELVE HE TOUCHED THE SPRING OF HIS REPEATER TO CORRECT THIS MOST PREPOSTEROUS CLOCK ITS RAPID LITTLE PULSE BEAT TWELVE AND STOPPED WHY IT ISNT POSSIBLE SAID SCROOGE THAT I CAN HAVE SLEPT THROUGH A WHOLE DAY AND FAR INTO ANOTHER NIGHT IT ISNT POSSIBLE THAT ANYTHING HAS HAPPENED TO THE SUN AND THIS IS TWELVE AT NOON THE IDEA BEING AN ALARMING ONE HE SCRAMBLED OUT OF BED AND GROPED HIS WAY TO THE WINDOW HE WAS OBLIGED TO RUB THE FROST OFF WITH THE SLEEVE OF HIS DRESSINGGOWN BEFORE HE COULD SEE ANYTHING AND COULD SEE VERY LITTLE THEN ALL HE COULD MAKE OUT WAS THAT IT WAS STILL VERY FOGGY AND EXTREMELY COLD AND THAT THERE WAS NO NOISE OF PEOPLE RUNNING TO AND FRO AND MAKING A GREAT STIR AS THERE UNQUESTIONABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF NIGHT HAD BEATEN OFF BRIGHT DAY AND TAKEN POSSESSION OF THE WORLD THIS WAS A GREAT RELIEF BECAUSE THREE DAYS AFTER SIGHT OF THIS FIRST OF EXCHANGE PAY TO MR EBENEZER SCROOGE OR HIS ORDER AND SO FORTH WOULD HAVE BECOME A MERE UNITED STATES SECURITY IF THERE WERE NO DAYS TO COUNT BY SCROOGE WENT TO BED AGAIN AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT AND THOUGHT IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT THE MORE HE THOUGHT THE MORE PERPLEXED HE WAS AND THE MORE HE ENDEAVOURED NOT TO THINK THE MORE HE THOUGHT MARLEYS GHOST BOTHERED HIM EXCEEDINGLY EVERY TIME HE RESOLVED WITHIN HIMSELF AFTER MATURE INQUIRY THAT IT WAS ALL A DREAM HIS MIND FLEW BACK AGAIN LIKE A STRONG SPRING RELEASED TO ITS FIRST POSITION AND PRESENTED THE SAME PROBLEM TO BE WORKED ALL THROUGH WAS IT A DREAM OR NOT SCROOGE LAY IN THIS STATE UNTIL THE CHIME HAD GONE THREE QUARTERS MORE WHEN HE REMEMBERED ON A SUDDEN THAT THE GHOST HAD WARNED HIM OF A VISITATION WHEN THE BELL TOLLED ONE HE RESOLVED TO LIE AWAKE UNTIL THE HOUR WAS PASSED AND CONSIDERING THAT HE COULD NO MORE GO TO SLEEP THAN GO TO HEAVEN THIS WAS PERHAPS THE WISEST RESOLUTION IN HIS POWER THE QUARTER WAS SO LONG THAT HE WAS MORE THAN ONCE CONVINCED HE MUST HAVE SUNK INTO A DOZE UNCONSCIOUSLY AND MISSED THE CLOCK AT LENGTH IT BROKE UPON HIS LISTENING EAR DING DONG A QUARTER PAST SAID SCROOGE COUNTING DING DONG HALFPAST SAID SCROOGE DING DONG A QUARTER TO IT SAID SCROOGE DING DONG THE HOUR ITSELF SAID SCROOGE TRIUMPHANTLY AND NOTHING ELSE HE SPOKE BEFORE THE HOUR BELL SOUNDED WHICH IT NOW DID WITH A DEEP DULL HOLLOW MELANCHOLY ONE LIGHT FLASHED UP IN THE ROOM UPON THE INSTANT AND THE CURTAINS OF HIS BED WERE DRAWN THE CURTAINS OF HIS BED WERE DRAWN ASIDE I TELL YOU BY A HAND NOT THE CURTAINS AT HIS FEET NOR THE CURTAINS AT HIS BACK BUT THOSE TO WHICH HIS FACE WAS ADDRESSED THE CURTAINS OF HIS BED WERE DRAWN ASIDE AND SCROOGE STARTING UP INTO A HALFRECUMBENT ATTITUDE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH THE UNEARTHLY VISITOR WHO DREW THEM AS CLOSE TO IT AS I AM NOW TO YOU AND I AM STANDING IN THE SPIRIT AT YOUR ELBOW IT WAS A STRANGE FIGURELIKE A CHILD YET NOT SO LIKE A CHILD AS LIKE AN OLD MAN VIEWED THROUGH SOME SUPERNATURAL MEDIUM WHICH GAVE HIM THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING RECEDED FROM THE VIEW AND BEING DIMINISHED TO A CHILDS PROPORTIONS ITS HAIR WHICH HUNG ABOUT ITS NECK AND DOWN ITS BACK WAS WHITE AS IF WITH AGE AND YET THE FACE HAD NOT A WRINKLE IN IT AND THE TENDEREST BLOOM WAS ON THE SKIN THE ARMS WERE VERY LONG AND MUSCULAR THE HANDS THE SAME AS IF ITS HOLD WERE OF UNCOMMON STRENGTH ITS LEGS AND FEET MOST DELICATELY FORMED WERE LIKE THOSE UPPER MEMBERS BARE IT WORE A TUNIC OF THE PUREST WHITE AND ROUND ITS WAIST WAS BOUND A LUSTROUS BELT THE SHEEN OF WHICH WAS BEAUTIFUL IT HELD A BRANCH OF FRESH GREEN HOLLY IN ITS HAND AND IN SINGULAR CONTRADICTION OF THAT WINTRY EMBLEM HAD ITS DRESS TRIMMED WITH SUMMER FLOWERS BUT THE STRANGEST THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT FROM THE CROWN OF ITS HEAD THERE SPRUNG A BRIGHT CLEAR JET OF LIGHT BY WHICH ALL THIS WAS VISIBLE AND WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS THE OCCASION OF ITS USING IN ITS DULLER MOMENTS A GREAT EXTINGUISHER FOR A CAP WHICH IT NOW HELD UNDER ITS ARM EVEN THIS THOUGH WHEN SCROOGE LOOKED AT IT WITH INCREASING STEADINESS WAS NOT ITS STRANGEST QUALITY FOR AS ITS BELT SPARKLED AND GLITTERED NOW IN ONE PART AND NOW IN ANOTHER AND WHAT WAS LIGHT ONE INSTANT AT ANOTHER TIME WAS DARK SO THE FIGURE ITSELF FLUCTUATED IN ITS DISTINCTNESS BEING NOW A THING WITH ONE ARM NOW WITH ONE LEG NOW WITH TWENTY LEGS NOW A PAIR OF LEGS WITHOUT A HEAD NOW A HEAD WITHOUT A BODY OF WHICH DISSOLVING PARTS NO OUTLINE WOULD BE VISIBLE IN THE DENSE GLOOM WHEREIN THEY MELTED AWAY AND IN THE VERY WONDER OF THIS IT WOULD BE ITSELF AGAIN DISTINCT AND CLEAR AS EVER ARE YOU THE SPIRIT SIR WHOSE COMING WAS FORETOLD TO ME ASKED SCROOGE I AM THE VOICE WAS SOFT AND GENTLE SINGULARLY LOW AS IF INSTEAD OF BEING SO CLOSE BESIDE HIM IT WERE AT A DISTANCE WHO AND WHAT ARE YOU SCROOGE DEMANDED I AM THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST LONG PAST INQUIRED SCROOGE OBSERVANT OF ITS DWARFISH STATURE NO YOUR PAST PERHAPS SCROOGE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD ANYBODY WHY IF ANYBODY COULD HAVE ASKED HIM BUT HE HAD A SPECIAL DESIRE TO SEE THE SPIRIT IN HIS CAP AND BEGGED HIM TO BE COVERED WHAT EXCLAIMED THE GHOST WOULD YOU SO SOON PUT OUT WITH WORLDLY HANDS THE LIGHT I GIVE IS IT NOT ENOUGH THAT YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE WHOSE PASSIONS MADE THIS CAP AND FORCE ME THROUGH WHOLE TRAINS OF YEARS TO WEAR IT LOW UPON MY BROW SCROOGE REVERENTLY DISCLAIMED ALL INTENTION TO OFFEND OR ANY KNOWLEDGE OF HAVING WILFULLY BONNETED THE SPIRIT AT ANY PERIOD OF HIS LIFE HE THEN MADE BOLD TO INQUIRE WHAT BUSINESS BROUGHT HIM THERE YOUR WELFARE SAID THE GHOST SCROOGE EXPRESSED HIMSELF MUCH OBLIGED BUT COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT A NIGHT OF UNBROKEN REST WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONDUCIVE TO THAT END THE SPIRIT MUST HAVE HEARD HIM THINKING FOR IT SAID IMMEDIATELY YOUR RECLAMATION THEN TAKE HEED IT PUT OUT ITS STRONG HAND AS IT SPOKE AND CLASPED HIM GENTLY BY THE ARM RISE AND WALK WITH ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN FOR SCROOGE TO PLEAD THAT THE WEATHER AND THE HOUR WERE NOT ADAPTED TO PEDESTRIAN PURPOSES THAT BED WAS WARM AND THE THERMOMETER A LONG WAY BELOW FREEZING THAT HE WAS CLAD BUT LIGHTLY IN HIS SLIPPERS DRESSINGGOWN AND NIGHTCAP AND THAT HE HAD A COLD UPON HIM AT THAT TIME THE GRASP THOUGH GENTLE AS A WOMANS HAND WAS NOT TO BE RESISTED HE ROSE BUT FINDING THAT THE SPIRIT MADE TOWARDS THE WINDOW CLASPED HIS ROBE IN SUPPLICATION I AM A MORTAL SCROOGE REMONSTRATED AND LIABLE TO FALL BEAR BUT A TOUCH OF MY HAND THERE SAID THE SPIRIT LAYING IT UPON HIS HEART AND YOU SHALL BE UPHELD IN MORE THAN THIS AS THE WORDS WERE SPOKEN THEY PASSED THROUGH THE WALL AND STOOD UPON AN OPEN COUNTRY ROAD WITH FIELDS ON EITHER HAND THE CITY HAD ENTIRELY VANISHED NOT A VESTIGE OF IT WAS TO BE SEEN THE DARKNESS AND THE MIST HAD VANISHED WITH IT FOR IT WAS A CLEAR COLD WINTER DAY WITH SNOW UPON THE GROUND GOOD HEAVEN SAID SCROOGE CLASPING HIS HANDS TOGETHER AS HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM I WAS BRED IN THIS PLACE I WAS A BOY HERE THE SPIRIT GAZED UPON HIM MILDLY ITS GENTLE TOUCH THOUGH IT HAD BEEN LIGHT AND INSTANTANEOUS APPEARED STILL PRESENT TO THE OLD MANS SENSE OF FEELING HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A THOUSAND ODOURS FLOATING IN THE AIR EACH ONE CONNECTED WITH A THOUSAND THOUGHTS AND HOPES AND JOYS AND CARES LONG LONG FORGOTTEN YOUR LIP IS TREMBLING SAID THE GHOST AND WHAT IS THAT UPON YOUR CHEEK SCROOGE MUTTERED WITH AN UNUSUAL CATCHING IN HIS VOICE THAT IT WAS A PIMPLE AND BEGGED THE GHOST TO LEAD HIM WHERE HE WOULD YOU RECOLLECT THE WAY INQUIRED THE SPIRIT REMEMBER IT CRIED SCROOGE WITH FERVOUR I COULD WALK IT BLINDFOLD STRANGE TO HAVE FORGOTTEN IT FOR SO MANY YEARS OBSERVED THE GHOST LET US GO ON THEY WALKED ALONG THE ROAD SCROOGE RECOGNISING EVERY GATE AND POST AND TREE UNTIL A LITTLE MARKETTOWN APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE WITH ITS BRIDGE ITS CHURCH AND WINDING RIVER SOME SHAGGY PONIES NOW WERE SEEN TROTTING TOWARDS THEM WITH BOYS UPON THEIR BACKS WHO CALLED TO OTHER BOYS IN COUNTRY GIGS AND CARTS DRIVEN BY FARMERS ALL THESE BOYS WERE IN GREAT SPIRITS AND SHOUTED TO EACH OTHER UNTIL THE BROAD FIELDS WERE SO FULL OF MERRY MUSIC THAT THE CRISP AIR LAUGHED TO HEAR IT THESE ARE BUT SHADOWS OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID THE GHOST THEY HAVE NO CONSCIOUSNESS OF US THE JOCUND TRAVELLERS CAME ON AND AS THEY CAME SCROOGE KNEW AND NAMED THEM EVERY ONE WHY WAS HE REJOICED BEYOND ALL BOUNDS TO SEE THEM WHY DID HIS COLD EYE GLISTEN AND HIS HEART LEAP UP AS THEY WENT PAST WHY WAS HE FILLED WITH GLADNESS WHEN HE HEARD THEM GIVE EACH OTHER MERRY CHRISTMAS AS THEY PARTED AT CROSSROADS AND BYEWAYS FOR THEIR SEVERAL HOMES WHAT WAS MERRY CHRISTMAS TO SCROOGE OUT UPON MERRY CHRISTMAS WHAT GOOD HAD IT EVER DONE TO HIM THE SCHOOL IS NOT QUITE DESERTED SAID THE GHOST A SOLITARY CHILD NEGLECTED BY HIS FRIENDS IS LEFT THERE STILL SCROOGE SAID HE KNEW IT AND HE SOBBED THEY LEFT THE HIGHROAD BY A WELLREMEMBERED LANE AND SOON APPROACHED A MANSION OF DULL RED BRICK WITH A LITTLE WEATHERCOCKSURMOUNTED CUPOLA ON THE ROOF AND A BELL HANGING IN IT IT WAS A LARGE HOUSE BUT ONE OF BROKEN FORTUNES FOR THE SPACIOUS OFFICES WERE LITTLE USED THEIR WALLS WERE DAMP AND MOSSY THEIR WINDOWS BROKEN AND THEIR GATES DECAYED FOWLS CLUCKED AND STRUTTED IN THE STABLES AND THE COACHHOUSES AND SHEDS WERE OVERRUN WITH GRASS NOR WAS IT MORE RETENTIVE OF ITS ANCIENT STATE WITHIN FOR ENTERING THE DREARY HALL AND GLANCING THROUGH THE OPEN DOORS OF MANY ROOMS THEY FOUND THEM POORLY FURNISHED COLD AND VAST THERE WAS AN EARTHY SAVOUR IN THE AIR A CHILLY BARENESS IN THE PLACE WHICH ASSOCIATED ITSELF SOMEHOW WITH TOO MUCH GETTING UP BY CANDLELIGHT AND NOT TOO MUCH TO EAT THEY WENT THE GHOST AND SCROOGE ACROSS THE HALL TO A DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE IT OPENED BEFORE THEM AND DISCLOSED A LONG BARE MELANCHOLY ROOM MADE BARER STILL BY LINES OF PLAIN DEAL FORMS AND DESKS AT ONE OF THESE A LONELY BOY WAS READING NEAR A FEEBLE FIRE AND SCROOGE SAT DOWN UPON A FORM AND WEPT TO SEE HIS POOR FORGOTTEN SELF AS HE USED TO BE NOT A LATENT ECHO IN THE HOUSE NOT A SQUEAK AND SCUFFLE FROM THE MICE BEHIND THE PANELLING NOT A DRIP FROM THE HALFTHAWED WATERSPOUT IN THE DULL YARD BEHIND NOT A SIGH AMONG THE LEAFLESS BOUGHS OF ONE DESPONDENT POPLAR NOT THE IDLE SWINGING OF AN EMPTY STOREHOUSE DOOR NO NOT A CLICKING IN THE FIRE BUT FELL UPON THE HEART OF SCROOGE WITH A SOFTENING INFLUENCE AND GAVE A FREER PASSAGE TO HIS TEARS THE SPIRIT TOUCHED HIM ON THE ARM AND POINTED TO HIS YOUNGER SELF INTENT UPON HIS READING SUDDENLY A MAN IN FOREIGN GARMENTS WONDERFULLY REAL AND DISTINCT TO LOOK AT STOOD OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WITH AN AXE STUCK IN HIS BELT AND LEADING BY THE BRIDLE AN ASS LADEN WITH WOOD WHY ITS ALI BABA SCROOGE EXCLAIMED IN ECSTASY ITS DEAR OLD HONEST ALI BABA YES YES I KNOW ONE CHRISTMAS TIME WHEN YONDER SOLITARY CHILD WAS LEFT HERE ALL ALONE HE DID COME FOR THE FIRST TIME JUST LIKE THAT POOR BOY AND VALENTINE SAID SCROOGE AND HIS WILD BROTHER ORSON THERE THEY GO AND WHATS HIS NAME WHO WAS PUT DOWN IN HIS DRAWERS ASLEEP AT THE GATE OF DAMASCUS DONT YOU SEE HIM AND THE SULTANS GROOM TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BY THE GENII THERE HE IS UPON HIS HEAD SERVE HIM RIGHT IM GLAD OF IT WHAT BUSINESS HAD HE TO BE MARRIED TO THE PRINCESS TO HEAR SCROOGE EXPENDING ALL THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS NATURE ON SUCH SUBJECTS IN A MOST EXTRAORDINARY VOICE BETWEEN LAUGHING AND CRYING AND TO SEE HIS HEIGHTENED AND EXCITED FACE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SURPRISE TO HIS BUSINESS FRIENDS IN THE CITY INDEED THERES THE PARROT CRIED SCROOGE GREEN BODY AND YELLOW TAIL WITH A THING LIKE A LETTUCE GROWING OUT OF THE TOP OF HIS HEAD THERE HE IS POOR ROBIN CRUSOE HE CALLED HIM WHEN HE CAME HOME AGAIN AFTER SAILING ROUND THE ISLAND POOR ROBIN CRUSOE WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ROBIN CRUSOE THE MAN THOUGHT HE WAS DREAMING BUT HE WASNT IT WAS THE PARROT YOU KNOW THERE GOES FRIDAY RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE TO THE LITTLE CREEK HALLOA HOOP HALLOO THEN WITH A RAPIDITY OF TRANSITION VERY FOREIGN TO HIS USUAL CHARACTER HE SAID IN PITY FOR HIS FORMER SELF POOR BOY AND CRIED AGAIN I WISH SCROOGE MUTTERED PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM AFTER DRYING HIS EYES WITH HIS CUFF BUT ITS TOO LATE NOW WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED THE SPIRIT NOTHING SAID SCROOGE NOTHING THERE WAS A BOY SINGING A CHRISTMAS CAROL AT MY DOOR LAST NIGHT I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE GIVEN HIM SOMETHING THATS ALL THE GHOST SMILED THOUGHTFULLY AND WAVED ITS HAND SAYING AS IT DID SO LET US SEE ANOTHER CHRISTMAS SCROOGES FORMER SELF GREW LARGER AT THE WORDS AND THE ROOM BECAME A LITTLE DARKER AND MORE DIRTY THE PANELS SHRUNK THE WINDOWS CRACKED FRAGMENTS OF PLASTER FELL OUT OF THE CEILING AND THE NAKED LATHS WERE SHOWN INSTEAD BUT HOW ALL THIS WAS BROUGHT ABOUT SCROOGE KNEW NO MORE THAN YOU DO HE ONLY KNEW THAT IT WAS QUITE CORRECT THAT EVERYTHING HAD HAPPENED SO THAT THERE HE WAS ALONE AGAIN WHEN ALL THE OTHER BOYS HAD GONE HOME FOR THE JOLLY HOLIDAYS HE WAS NOT READING NOW BUT WALKING UP AND DOWN DESPAIRINGLY SCROOGE LOOKED AT THE GHOST AND WITH A MOURNFUL SHAKING OF HIS HEAD GLANCED ANXIOUSLY TOWARDS THE DOOR IT OPENED AND A LITTLE GIRL MUCH YOUNGER THAN THE BOY CAME DARTING IN AND PUTTING HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK AND OFTEN KISSING HIM ADDRESSED HIM AS HER DEAR DEAR BROTHER I HAVE COME TO BRING YOU HOME DEAR BROTHER SAID THE CHILD CLAPPING HER TINY HANDS AND BENDING DOWN TO LAUGH TO BRING YOU HOME HOME HOME HOME LITTLE FAN RETURNED THE BOY YES SAID THE CHILD BRIMFUL OF GLEE HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL HOME FOR EVER AND EVER FATHER IS SO MUCH KINDER THAN HE USED TO BE THAT HOMES LIKE HEAVEN HE SPOKE SO GENTLY TO ME ONE DEAR NIGHT WHEN I WAS GOING TO BED THAT I WAS NOT AFRAID TO ASK HIM ONCE MORE IF YOU MIGHT COME HOME AND HE SAID YES YOU

AND IN THE HALL APPEARED THE SCHOOLMASTER HIMSELF WHO GLARED ON MASTER SCROOGE WITH A FEROCIOUS CONDESCENSION AND THREW HIM INTO A DREADFUL STATE OF MIND BY SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM HE THEN CONVEYED HIM AND HIS SISTER INTO THE VERIEST OLD WELL OF A SHIVERING BESTPARLOUR THAT EVER WAS SEEN WHERE THE MAPS UPON THE WALL AND THE CELESTIAL AND TERRESTRIAL GLOBES IN THE WINDOWS WERE WAXY WITH COLD HERE HE PRODUCED A DECANTER OF CURIOUSLY LIGHT WINE AND A BLOCK OF CURIOUSLY HEAVY CAKE AND ADMINISTERED INSTALMENTS OF THOSE DAINTIES TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME SENDING OUT A MEAGRE SERVANT TO OFFER A GLASS OF SOMETHING TO THE POSTBOY WHO ANSWERED THAT HE THANKED THE GENTLEMAN BUT IF IT WAS THE SAME TAP AS HE HAD TASTED BEFORE HE HAD RATHER NOT MASTER SCROOGES TRUNK BEING BY THIS TIME TIED

THE SCENE AND WITH HIS FORMER SELF HE CORROBORATED EVERYTHING REMEMBERED EVERYTHING ENJOYED EVERYTHING AND UNDERWENT THE STRANGEST AGITATION IT WAS NOT UNTIL NOW WHEN THE BRIGHT FACES OF HIS FORMER SELF AND DICK WERE TURNED FROM THEM THAT HE REMEMBERED THE GHOST AND BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS LOOKING FULL UPON HIM WHILE THE LIGHT UPON ITS HEAD BURNT VERY CLEAR A SMALL MATTER SAID THE GHOST TO MAKE THESE SILLY FOLKS SO FULL OF GRATITUDE SMALL ECHOED SCROOGE THE SPIRIT SIGNED TO HIM TO LISTEN TO THE TWO APPRENTICES WHO WERE POURING OUT THEIR HEARTS IN PRAISE OF FEZZIWIG AND WHEN HE HAD DONE SO SAID WHY IS IT NOT HE HAS SPENT BUT A FEW POUNDS OF YOUR MORTAL MONEY THREE OR FOUR PERHAPS IS THAT SO MUCH THAT HE DESERVES THIS PRAISE IT ISNT THAT SAID SCROOGE HEATED BY THE REMARK AND SPEAKING

WORTH OR VALUE IN YOUR SIGHT IF THIS HAD NEVER BEEN BETWEEN US SAID THE GIRL LOOKING MILDLY BUT WITH STEADINESS UPON HIM TELL ME WOULD YOU SEEK ME OUT AND TRY TO WIN ME NOW AH NO HE SEEMED TO YIELD TO THE JUSTICE OF THIS SUPPOSITION IN SPITE OF HIMSELF BUT HE SAID WITH A STRUGGLE YOU THINK NOT I WOULD GLADLY THINK OTHERWISE IF I COULD SHE ANSWERED HEAVEN KNOWS WHEN I HAVE LEARNED A TRUTH LIKE THIS I KNOW HOW STRONG AND IRRESISTIBLE IT MUST BE BUT IF YOU WERE FREE TODAY TOMORROW YESTERDAY CAN EVEN I BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD CHOOSE A DOWERLESS GIRLYOU WHO IN YOUR VERY CONFIDENCE WITH HER WEIGH EVERYTHING BY GAIN OR CHOOSING HER IF FOR A MOMENT YOU WERE FALSE ENOUGH TO YOUR ONE GUIDING PRINCIPLE TO DO SO DO I NOT KNOW THAT YOUR REPENTANCE AND REGRET WOULD SURELY FOLLOW I DO AND I RELEASE YOU WITH A FULL HEART FOR THE LOVE OF HIM YOU ONCE WERE HE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK BUT WITH HER HEAD TURNED FROM HIM SHE RESUMED YOU MAYTHE MEMORY OF WHAT IS PAST HALF MAKES ME HOPE YOU WILLHAVE PAIN IN THIS A VERY VERY BRIEF TIME AND YOU WILL DISMISS THE RECOLLECTION OF IT GLADLY AS AN UNPROFITABLE DREAM FROM WHICH IT HAPPENED WELL THAT YOU AWOKE MAY YOU BE HAPPY IN THE LIFE YOU HAVE CHOSEN SHE LEFT HIM AND THEY PARTED SPIRIT SAID SCROOGE SHOW ME NO MORE CONDUCT ME HOME WHY DO YOU DELIGHT TO TORTURE ME ONE SHADOW MORE EXCLAIMED THE GHOST NO MORE CRIED SCROOGE NO MORE I DONT WISH TO SEE IT SHOW ME NO MORE BUT THE RELENTLESS GHOST PINIONED HIM IN BOTH HIS ARMS AND FORCED HIM TO OBSERVE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT THEY WERE IN ANOTHER SCENE AND PLACE A ROOM NOT VERY LARGE OR HANDSOME BUT FULL OF COMFORT NEAR TO THE WINTER FIRE SAT A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL SO LIKE THAT LAST THAT SCROOGE BELIEVED IT WAS THE SAME UNTIL HE SAW HER NOW A COMELY MATRON SITTING OPPOSITE HER DAUGHTER THE NOISE IN THIS ROOM WAS PERFECTLY TUMULTUOUS FOR THERE WERE MORE CHILDREN THERE THAN SCROOGE IN HIS AGITATED STATE OF MIND COULD COUNT AND UNLIKE THE CELEBRATED HERD IN THE POEM THEY WERE NOT FORTY CHILDREN CONDUCTING THEMSELVES LIKE ONE BUT EVERY CHILD WAS CONDUCTING ITSELF LIKE FORTY THE CONSEQUENCES WERE UPROARIOUS BEYOND BELIEF BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO CARE ON THE CONTRARY THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER LAUGHED HEARTILY AND ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH AND THE LATTER SOON BEGINNING TO MINGLE IN THE SPORTS GOT PILLAGED BY THE YOUNG BRIGANDS MOST RUTHLESSLY WHAT WOULD I NOT HAVE GIVEN TO BE ONE OF THEM THOUGH I NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN SO RUDE NO NO I WOULDNT FOR THE WEALTH OF ALL THE WORLD HAVE CRUSHED THAT BRAIDED HAIR AND TORN IT DOWN AND FOR THE PRECIOUS LITTLE SHOE I WOULDNT HAVE PLUCKED IT OFF GOD BLESS MY SOUL TO SAVE MY LIFE AS TO MEASURING HER WAIST IN SPORT AS THEY DID BOLD YOUNG BROOD I COULDNT HAVE DONE IT I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED MY ARM TO HAVE GROWN ROUND IT FOR A PUNISHMENT AND NEVER COME STRAIGHT AGAIN AND YET I SHOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED I OWN TO HAVE TOUCHED HER LIPS TO HAVE QUESTIONED HER THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE OPENED THEM TO HAVE LOOKED UPON THE LASHES OF HER DOWNCAST EYES AND NEVER RAISED A BLUSH TO HAVE LET LOOSE WAVES OF HAIR AN INCH OF WHICH WOULD BE A KEEPSAKE BEYOND PRICE IN SHORT I SHOULD HAVE LIKED I DO CONFESS TO HAVE HAD THE LIGHTEST LICENCE OF A CHILD AND YET TO HAVE BEEN MAN ENOUGH TO KNOW ITS VALUE BUT NOW A KNOCKING AT THE DOOR WAS HEARD AND SUCH A RUSH IMMEDIATELY ENSUED THAT SHE WITH LAUGHING FACE AND PLUNDERED DRESS WAS BORNE TOWARDS IT THE CENTRE OF A FLUSHED AND BOISTEROUS GROUP JUST IN TIME TO GREET THE FATHER WHO CAME HOME ATTENDED BY A MAN LADEN WITH CHRISTMAS TOYS AND PRESENTS THEN THE SHOUTING AND THE STRUGGLING AND THE ONSLAUGHT THAT WAS MADE ON THE DEFENCELESS PORTER THE SCALING HIM WITH CHAIRS FOR LADDERS TO DIVE INTO HIS POCKETS DESPOIL HIM OF BROWNPAPER PARCELS HOLD ON TIGHT BY HIS CRAVAT HUG HIM ROUND HIS NECK POMMEL HIS BACK AND KICK HIS LEGS IN IRREPRESSIBLE AFFECTION THE SHOUTS OF WONDER AND DELIGHT WITH WHICH THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY PACKAGE WAS RECEIVED THE TERRIBLE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE BABY HAD BEEN TAKEN IN THE ACT OF PUTTING A DOLLS FRYINGPAN INTO HIS MOUTH AND WAS MORE THAN SUSPECTED OF HAVING SWALLOWED A FICTITIOUS TURKEY GLUED ON A WOODEN PLATTER THE IMMENSE RELIEF OF FINDING THIS A FALSE ALARM THE JOY AND GRATITUDE AND ECSTASY THEY ARE ALL INDESCRIBABLE ALIKE IT IS ENOUGH THAT BY DEGREES THE CHILDREN AND THEIR EMOTIONS GOT OUT OF THE PARLOUR AND BY ONE STAIR AT A TIME UP TO THE TOP OF THE HOUSE WHERE THEY WENT TO BED AND SO SUBSIDED AND NOW SCROOGE LOOKED ON MORE ATTENTIVELY THAN EVER WHEN THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HAVING HIS DAUGHTER LEANING FONDLY ON HIM SAT DOWN WITH HER AND HER MOTHER AT HIS OWN FIRESIDE AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT SUCH ANOTHER CREATURE QUITE AS GRACEFUL AND AS FULL OF PROMISE MIGHT HAVE CALLED HIM FATHER AND BEEN A SPRINGTIME IN THE HAGGARD WINTER OF HIS LIFE HIS SIGHT GREW VERY DIM INDEED BELLE SAID THE HUSBAND TURNING TO HIS WIFE WITH A SMILE I SAW AN OLD FRIEND OF YOURS THIS AFTERNOON WHO WAS IT GUESS HOW CAN I TUT DONT I KNOW SHE ADDED IN THE SAME BREATH LAUGHING AS HE LAUGHED MR SCROOGE MR SCROOGE IT WAS I PASSED HIS OFFICE WINDOW AND AS IT WAS NOT SHUT UP AND HE HAD A CANDLE INSIDE I COULD SCARCELY HELP SEEING HIM HIS PARTNER LIES UPON THE POINT OF DEATH I HEAR AND THERE HE SAT ALONE QUITE ALONE IN THE WORLD I DO BELIEVE SPIRIT SAID SCROOGE IN A BROKEN VOICE REMOVE ME FROM THIS PLACE I TOLD YOU THESE WERE SHADOWS OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID THE GHOST THAT THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE DO NOT BLAME ME REMOVE ME SCROOGE EXCLAIMED I CANNOT BEAR IT HE TURNED UPON THE GHOST AND SEEING THAT IT LOOKED UPON HIM WITH A FACE IN WHICH IN SOME STRANGE WAY THERE WERE FRAGMENTS OF ALL THE FACES IT HAD SHOWN HIM WRESTLED WITH IT LEAVE ME TAKE ME BACK HAUNT ME NO LONGER IN THE STRUGGLE IF THAT CAN BE CALLED A STRUGGLE IN WHICH THE GHOST WITH NO VISIBLE RESISTANCE ON ITS OWN PART WAS UNDISTURBED BY ANY EFFORT OF ITS ADVERSARY SCROOGE OBSERVED THAT ITS LIGHT WAS BURNING HIGH AND BRIGHT AND DIMLY CONNECTING THAT WITH ITS INFLUENCE OVER HIM HE SEIZED THE EXTINGUISHERCAP AND BY A SUDDEN ACTION PRESSED IT DOWN UPON ITS HEAD THE SPIRIT DROPPED BENEATH IT SO THAT THE EXTINGUISHER COVERED ITS WHOLE FORM BUT THOUGH SCROOGE PRESSED IT DOWN WITH ALL HIS FORCE HE COULD NOT HIDE THE LIGHT WHICH STREAMED FROM UNDER IT IN AN UNBROKEN FLOOD UPON THE GROUND HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING EXHAUSTED AND OVERCOME BY AN IRRESISTIBLE DROWSINESS AND FURTHER OF BEING IN HIS OWN BEDROOM HE GAVE THE CAP A PARTING SQUEEZE IN WHICH HIS HAND RELAXED AND HAD BARELY TIME TO REEL TO BED BEFORE HE SANK INTO A HEAVY SLEEP STAVE III THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS AWAKING IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRODIGIOUSLY TOUGH SNORE AND SITTING UP IN BED TO GET HIS THOUGHTS TOGETHER SCROOGE HAD NO OCCASION TO BE TOLD THAT THE BELL WAS AGAIN UPON THE STROKE OF ONE HE FELT THAT HE WAS RESTORED TO CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE RIGHT NICK OF TIME FOR THE ESPECIAL PURPOSE OF HOLDING A CONFERENCE WITH THE SECOND MESSENGER DESPATCHED TO HIM THROUGH JACOB MARLEYS INTERVENTION BUT FINDING THAT HE TURNED UNCOMFORTABLY COLD WHEN HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHICH OF HIS CURTAINS THIS NEW SPECTRE WOULD DRAW BACK HE PUT THEM EVERY ONE ASIDE WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND LYING DOWN AGAIN ESTABLISHED A SHARP LOOKOUT ALL ROUND THE BED FOR HE WISHED TO CHALLENGE THE SPIRIT ON THE MOMENT OF ITS APPEARANCE AND DID NOT WISH TO BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND MADE NERVOUS GENTLEMEN OF THE FREEANDEASY SORT WHO PLUME THEMSELVES ON BEING ACQUAINTED WITH A MOVE OR TWO AND BEING USUALLY EQUAL TO THE TIMEOFDAY EXPRESS THE WIDE RANGE OF THEIR CAPACITY FOR ADVENTURE BY OBSERVING THAT THEY ARE GOOD FOR ANYTHING FROM PITCHANDTOSS TO MANSLAUGHTER BETWEEN WHICH OPPOSITE EXTREMES NO DOUBT THERE LIES A TOLERABLY WIDE AND COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF SUBJECTS WITHOUT VENTURING FOR SCROOGE QUITE AS HARDILY AS THIS I DONT MIND CALLING ON YOU TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS READY FOR A GOOD BROAD FIELD OF STRANGE APPEARANCES AND THAT NOTHING BETWEEN A BABY AND RHINOCEROS WOULD HAVE ASTONISHED HIM VERY MUCH NOW BEING PREPARED FOR ALMOST ANYTHING HE WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS PREPARED FOR NOTHING AND CONSEQUENTLY WHEN THE BELL STRUCK ONE AND NO SHAPE APPEARED HE WAS TAKEN WITH A VIOLENT FIT OF TREMBLING FIVE MINUTES TEN MINUTES A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WENT BY YET NOTHING CAME ALL THIS TIME HE LAY UPON HIS BED THE VERY CORE AND CENTRE OF A BLAZE OF RUDDY LIGHT WHICH STREAMED UPON IT WHEN THE CLOCK PROCLAIMED THE HOUR AND WHICH BEING ONLY LIGHT WAS MORE ALARMING THAN A DOZEN GHOSTS AS HE WAS POWERLESS TO MAKE OUT WHAT IT MEANT OR WOULD BE AT AND WAS SOMETIMES APPREHENSIVE THAT HE MIGHT BE AT THAT VERY MOMENT AN INTERESTING CASE OF SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION WITHOUT HAVING THE CONSOLATION OF KNOWING IT AT LAST HOWEVER HE BEGAN TO THINKAS YOU OR I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AT FIRST FOR IT IS ALWAYS THE PERSON NOT IN THE PREDICAMENT WHO KNOWS WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DONE IN IT AND WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY HAVE DONE IT TOOAT LAST I SAY HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT THE SOURCE AND SECRET OF THIS GHOSTLY LIGHT MIGHT BE IN THE ADJOINING ROOM FROM WHENCE ON FURTHER TRACING IT IT SEEMED TO SHINE THIS IDEA TAKING FULL POSSESSION OF HIS MIND HE GOT UP SOFTLY AND SHUFFLED IN HIS SLIPPERS TO THE DOOR THE MOMENT SCROOGES HAND WAS ON THE LOCK A STRANGE VOICE CALLED HIM BY HIS NAME AND BADE HIM ENTER HE OBEYED IT WAS HIS OWN ROOM THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BUT IT HAD UNDERGONE A SURPRISING TRANSFORMATION THE WALLS AND CEILING WERE SO HUNG WITH LIVING GREEN THAT IT LOOKED A PERFECT GROVE FROM EVERY PART OF WHICH BRIGHT GLEAMING BERRIES GLISTENED THE CRISP LEAVES OF HOLLY MISTLETOE AND IVY REFLECTED BACK THE LIGHT AS IF SO MANY LITTLE MIRRORS HAD BEEN SCATTERED THERE AND SUCH A MIGHTY BLAZE WENT ROARING UP THE CHIMNEY AS THAT DULL PETRIFICATION OF A HEARTH HAD NEVER KNOWN IN SCROOGES TIME OR MARLEYS OR FOR MANY AND MANY A WINTER SEASON GONE HEAPED UP ON THE FLOOR TO FORM A KIND OF THRONE WERE TURKEYS GEESE GAME POULTRY BRAWN GREAT JOINTS OF MEAT SUCKINGPIGS LONG WREATHS OF SAUSAGES MINCEPIES PLUMPUDDINGS BARRELS OF OYSTERS REDHOT CHESTNUTS CHERRYCHEEKED APPLES JUICY ORANGES LUSCIOUS PEARS IMMENSE TWELFTHCAKES AND SEETHING BOWLS OF PUNCH THAT MADE THE CHAMBER DIM WITH THEIR DELICIOUS STEAM IN EASY STATE UPON THIS COUCH THERE SAT A JOLLY GIANT GLORIOUS TO SEE WHO BORE A GLOWING TORCH IN SHAPE NOT UNLIKE PLENTYS HORN AND HELD IT UP HIGH UP TO SHED ITS LIGHT ON SCROOGE AS HE CAME PEEPING ROUND THE DOOR COME IN EXCLAIMED THE GHOST COME IN AND KNOW ME BETTER MAN SCROOGE ENTERED TIMIDLY AND HUNG HIS HEAD BEFORE THIS SPIRIT HE WAS NOT THE DOGGED SCROOGE HE HAD BEEN AND THOUGH THE SPIRITS EYES WERE CLEAR AND KIND HE DID NOT LIKE TO MEET THEM I AM THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT SAID THE SPIRIT LOOK UPON ME SCROOGE REVERENTLY DID SO IT WAS CLOTHED IN ONE SIMPLE GREEN ROBE OR MANTLE BORDERED WITH WHITE FUR THIS GARMENT HUNG SO LOOSELY ON THE FIGURE THAT ITS CAPACIOUS BREAST WAS BARE AS IF DISDAINING TO BE WARDED OR CONCEALED BY ANY ARTIFICE ITS FEET OBSERVABLE BENEATH THE AMPLE FOLDS OF THE GARMENT WERE ALSO BARE AND ON ITS HEAD IT WORE NO OTHER COVERING THAN A HOLLY WREATH SET HERE AND THERE WITH SHINING ICICLES ITS DARK BROWN CURLS WERE LONG AND FREE FREE AS ITS GENIAL FACE ITS SPARKLING EYE ITS OPEN HAND ITS CHEERY VOICE ITS UNCONSTRAINED DEMEANOUR AND ITS JOYFUL AIR GIRDED ROUND ITS MIDDLE WAS AN ANTIQUE SCABBARD BUT NO SWORD WAS IN IT AND THE ANCIENT SHEATH WAS EATEN UP WITH RUST YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THE LIKE OF ME BEFORE EXCLAIMED THE SPIRIT NEVER SCROOGE MADE ANSWER TO IT HAVE NEVER WALKED FORTH WITH THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY MEANING FOR I AM VERY YOUNG MY ELDER BROTHERS BORN IN THESE LATER YEARS PURSUED THE PHANTOM I DONT THINK I HAVE SAID SCROOGE I AM AFRAID I HAVE NOT HAVE YOU HAD MANY BROTHERS SPIRIT MORE THAN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE GHOST A TREMENDOUS FAMILY TO PROVIDE FOR MUTTERED SCROOGE THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT ROSE SPIRIT SAID SCROOGE SUBMISSIVELY CONDUCT ME WHERE YOU WILL I WENT FORTH LAST NIGHT ON COMPULSION AND I LEARNT A LESSON WHICH IS WORKING NOW TONIGHT IF YOU HAVE AUGHT TO TEACH ME LET ME PROFIT BY IT TOUCH MY ROBE SCROOGE DID AS HE WAS TOLD AND HELD IT FAST HOLLY MISTLETOE RED BERRIES IVY TURKEYS GEESE GAME POULTRY BRAWN MEAT PIGS SAUSAGES OYSTERS PIES PUDDINGS FRUIT AND PUNCH ALL VANISHED INSTANTLY SO DID THE ROOM THE FIRE THE RUDDY GLOW THE HOUR OF NIGHT AND THEY STOOD IN THE CITY STREETS ON CHRISTMAS MORNING WHERE FOR THE WEATHER WAS SEVERE THE PEOPLE MADE A ROUGH BUT BRISK AND NOT UNPLEASANT KIND OF MUSIC IN SCRAPING THE SNOW FROM THE PAVEMENT IN FRONT OF THEIR DWELLINGS AND FROM THE TOPS OF THEIR HOUSES WHENCE IT WAS MAD DELIGHT TO THE BOYS TO SEE IT COME PLUMPING DOWN INTO THE ROAD BELOW AND SPLITTING INTO ARTIFICIAL LITTLE SNOWSTORMS THE HOUSE FRONTS LOOKED BLACK ENOUGH AND THE WINDOWS BLACKER CONTRASTING WITH THE SMOOTH WHITE SHEET OF SNOW UPON THE ROOFS AND WITH THE DIRTIER SNOW UPON THE GROUND WHICH LAST DEPOSIT HAD BEEN PLOUGHED UP IN DEEP FURROWS BY THE HEAVY WHEELS OF CARTS AND WAGGONS FURROWS THAT CROSSED AND RECROSSED EACH OTHER HUNDREDS OF TIMES WHERE THE GREAT STREETS BRANCHED OFF AND MADE INTRICATE CHANNELS HARD TO TRACE IN THE THICK YELLOW MUD AND ICY WATER THE SKY WAS GLOOMY AND THE SHORTEST STREETS WERE CHOKED UP WITH A DINGY MIST HALF THAWED HALF FROZEN WHOSE HEAVIER PARTICLES DESCENDED IN A SHOWER OF SOOTY ATOMS AS IF ALL THE CHIMNEYS IN GREAT BRITAIN HAD BY ONE CONSENT CAUGHT FIRE AND WERE BLAZING AWAY TO THEIR DEAR HEARTS CONTENT THERE WAS NOTHING VERY CHEERFUL IN THE CLIMATE OR THE TOWN AND YET WAS THERE AN AIR OF CHEERFULNESS ABROAD THAT THE CLEAREST SUMMER AIR AND BRIGHTEST SUMMER SUN MIGHT HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO DIFFUSE IN VAIN FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SHOVELLING AWAY ON THE HOUSETOPS WERE JOVIAL AND FULL OF GLEE CALLING OUT TO ONE ANOTHER FROM THE PARAPETS AND NOW AND THEN EXCHANGING A FACETIOUS SNOWBALLBETTERNATURED MISSILE FAR THAN MANY A WORDY JEST LAUGHING HEARTILY IF IT WENT RIGHT AND NOT LESS HEARTILY IF IT WENT WRONG THE POULTERERS SHOPS WERE STILL HALF OPEN AND THE FRUITERERS WERE RADIANT IN THEIR GLORY THERE WERE GREAT ROUND POTBELLIED BASKETS OF CHESTNUTS SHAPED LIKE THE WAISTCOATS OF JOLLY OLD GENTLEMEN LOLLING AT THE DOORS AND TUMBLING OUT INTO THE STREET IN THEIR APOPLECTIC OPULENCE THERE WERE RUDDY BROWNFACED BROADGIRTHED SPANISH ONIONS SHINING IN THE FATNESS OF THEIR GROWTH LIKE SPANISH FRIARS AND WINKING FROM THEIR SHELVES IN WANTON SLYNESS AT THE GIRLS AS THEY WENT BY AND GLANCED DEMURELY AT THE HUNGUP MISTLETOE THERE WERE PEARS AND APPLES CLUSTERED HIGH IN BLOOMING PYRAMIDS THERE WERE BUNCHES OF GRAPES MADE IN THE SHOPKEEPERS BENEVOLENCE TO DANGLE FROM CONSPICUOUS HOOKS THAT PEOPLES MOUTHS MIGHT WATER GRATIS AS THEY PASSED THERE WERE PILES OF FILBERTS MOSSY AND BROWN RECALLING IN THEIR FRAGRANCE ANCIENT WALKS AMONG THE WOODS AND PLEASANT SHUFFLINGS ANKLE DEEP THROUGH WITHERED LEAVES THERE WERE NORFOLK BIFFINS SQUAT AND SWARTHY SETTING OFF THE YELLOW OF THE ORANGES AND LEMONS AND IN THE GREAT COMPACTNESS OF THEIR JUICY PERSONS URGENTLY ENTREATING AND BESEECHING TO BE CARRIED HOME IN PAPER BAGS AND EATEN AFTER DINNER THE VERY GOLD AND SILVER FISH SET FORTH AMONG THESE CHOICE FRUITS IN A BOWL THOUGH MEMBERS OF A DULL AND STAGNANTBLOODED RACE APPEARED TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON AND TO A FISH WENT GASPING ROUND AND ROUND THEIR LITTLE WORLD IN SLOW AND PASSIONLESS EXCITEMENT THE GROCERS OH THE GROCERS NEARLY CLOSED WITH PERHAPS TWO SHUTTERS DOWN OR ONE BUT THROUGH THOSE GAPS SUCH GLIMPSES IT WAS NOT ALONE THAT THE SCALES DESCENDING ON THE COUNTER MADE A MERRY SOUND OR THAT THE TWINE AND ROLLER PARTED COMPANY SO BRISKLY OR THAT THE CANISTERS WERE RATTLED UP AND DOWN LIKE JUGGLING TRICKS OR EVEN THAT THE BLENDED SCENTS OF TEA AND COFFEE WERE SO GRATEFUL TO THE NOSE OR EVEN THAT THE RAISINS WERE SO PLENTIFUL AND RARE THE ALMONDS SO EXTREMELY WHITE THE STICKS OF CINNAMON SO LONG AND STRAIGHT THE OTHER SPICES SO DELICIOUS THE CANDIED FRUITS SO CAKED AND SPOTTED WITH MOLTEN SUGAR AS TO MAKE THE COLDEST LOOKERSON FEEL FAINT AND SUBSEQUENTLY BILIOUS NOR WAS IT THAT THE FIGS WERE MOIST AND PULPY OR THAT THE FRENCH PLUMS BLUSHED IN MODEST TARTNESS FROM THEIR HIGHLYDECORATED BOXES OR THAT EVERYTHING WAS GOOD TO EAT AND IN ITS CHRISTMAS DRESS BUT THE CUSTOMERS WERE ALL SO HURRIED AND SO EAGER IN THE HOPEFUL PROMISE OF THE DAY THAT THEY TUMBLED UP AGAINST EACH OTHER AT THE DOOR CRASHING THEIR WICKER BASKETS WILDLY AND LEFT THEIR PURCHASES UPON THE COUNTER AND CAME RUNNING BACK TO FETCH THEM AND COMMITTED HUNDREDS OF THE LIKE MISTAKES IN THE BEST HUMOUR POSSIBLE WHILE THE GROCER AND HIS PEOPLE WERE SO FRANK AND FRESH THAT THE POLISHED HEARTS WITH WHICH THEY FASTENED THEIR APRONS BEHIND MIGHT HAVE BEEN THEIR OWN WORN OUTSIDE FOR GENERAL INSPECTION AND FOR CHRISTMAS DAWS TO PECK AT IF THEY CHOSE BUT SOON THE STEEPLES CALLED GOOD PEOPLE ALL TO CHURCH AND CHAPEL AND AWAY THEY CAME FLOCKING THROUGH THE STREETS IN THEIR BEST CLOTHES AND WITH THEIR GAYEST FACES AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE EMERGED FROM SCORES OF BYESTREETS LANES AND NAMELESS TURNINGS INNUMERABLE PEOPLE CARRYING THEIR DINNERS TO THE BAKERS SHOPS THE SIGHT OF THESE POOR REVELLERS APPEARED TO INTEREST THE SPIRIT VERY MUCH FOR HE STOOD WITH SCROOGE BESIDE HIM IN A BAKERS DOORWAY AND TAKING OFF THE COVERS AS THEIR BEARERS PASSED SPRINKLED INCENSE ON THEIR DINNERS FROM HIS TORCH AND IT WAS A VERY UNCOMMON KIND OF TORCH FOR ONCE OR TWICE WHEN THERE WERE ANGRY WORDS BETWEEN SOME DINNERCARRIERS WHO HAD JOSTLED EACH OTHER HE SHED A FEW DROPS OF WATER ON THEM FROM IT AND THEIR GOOD HUMOUR WAS RESTORED DIRECTLY FOR THEY SAID IT WAS A SHAME TO QUARREL UPON CHRISTMAS DAY AND SO IT WAS GOD LOVE IT SO IT WAS IN TIME THE BELLS CEASED AND THE BAKERS WERE SHUT UP AND YET THERE WAS A GENIAL SHADOWING FORTH OF ALL THESE DINNERS AND THE PROGRESS OF THEIR COOKING IN THE THAWED BLOTCH OF WET ABOVE EACH BAKERS OVEN WHERE THE PAVEMENT SMOKED AS IF ITS STONES WERE COOKING TOO IS THERE A PECULIAR FLAVOUR IN WHAT YOU SPRINKLE FROM YOUR TORCH ASKED SCROOGE THERE IS MY OWN WOULD IT APPLY TO ANY KIND OF DINNER ON THIS DAY ASKED SCROOGE TO ANY KINDLY GIVEN TO A POOR ONE MOST WHY TO A POOR ONE MOST ASKED SCROOGE BECAUSE IT NEEDS IT MOST SPIRIT SAID SCROOGE AFTER A MOMENTS THOUGHT I WONDER YOU OF ALL THE BEINGS IN THE MANY WORLDS ABOUT US SHOULD DESIRE TO CRAMP THESE PEOPLES OPPORTUNITIES OF INNOCENT ENJOYMENT I CRIED THE SPIRIT YOU WOULD DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR MEANS OF DINING EVERY SEVENTH DAY OFTEN THE ONLY DAY ON WHICH THEY CAN BE SAID TO DINE AT ALL SAID SCROOGE WOULDNT YOU I CRIED THE SPIRIT YOU SEEK TO CLOSE THESE PLACES ON THE SEVENTH DAY SAID SCROOGE AND IT COMES TO THE SAME THING I SEEK EXCLAIMED THE SPIRIT FORGIVE ME IF I AM WRONG IT HAS BEEN DONE IN YOUR NAME OR AT LEAST IN THAT OF YOUR FAMILY

HAD BEEN BEFORE INTO THE SUBURBS OF THE TOWN IT WAS A REMARKABLE QUALITY OF THE GHOST WHICH SCROOGE HAD OBSERVED AT THE BAKERS THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GIGANTIC SIZE HE COULD ACCOMMODATE HIMSELF TO ANY PLACE WITH EASE AND THAT HE STOOD BENEATH A LOW ROOF QUITE AS GRACEFULLY AND LIKE A SUPERNATURAL CREATURE AS IT WAS POSSIBLE HE COULD HAVE DONE IN ANY LOFTY HALL AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE PLEASURE THE GOOD SPIRIT HAD IN SHOWING OFF THIS POWER OF HIS OR ELSE IT WAS HIS OWN KIND GENEROUS HEARTY NATURE AND HIS SYMPATHY WITH ALL POOR MEN THAT LED HIM STRAIGHT TO SCROOGES CLERKS FOR THERE HE WENT AND TOOK SCROOGE WITH HIM HOLDING TO HIS ROBE AND ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR THE SPIRIT SMILED AND STOPPED TO BLESS BOB CRATCHITS DWELLING WITH THE SPRINKLING OF HIS TORCH THINK OF THAT BOB HAD BUT FIFTEEN BOB AWEEK HIMSELF HE POCKETED ON SATURDAYS BUT FIFTEEN COPIES OF HIS CHRISTIAN NAME AND YET THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT BLESSED HIS FOURROOMED HOUSE THEN UP ROSE MRS CRATCHIT CRATCHITS WIFE

SITUATION IN HIS EYE FOR MASTER PETER WHICH WOULD BRING IN IF OBTAINED FULL FIVEANDSIXPENCE WEEKLY THE TWO YOUNG CRATCHITS LAUGHED TREMENDOUSLY AT THE IDEA OF PETERS BEING A MAN OF BUSINESS AND PETER HIMSELF LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE FIRE FROM BETWEEN HIS COLLARS AS IF HE WERE DELIBERATING WHAT PARTICULAR INVESTMENTS HE SHOULD FAVOUR WHEN HE CAME INTO THE RECEIPT OF THAT BEWILDERING INCOME MARTHA WHO WAS A POOR APPRENTICE AT A MILLINERS THEN TOLD THEM WHAT KIND OF WORK SHE HAD TO DO AND HOW MANY HOURS SHE WORKED AT A STRETCH AND HOW SHE MEANT TO LIE ABED TOMORROW MORNING FOR A GOOD LONG REST TOMORROW BEING A HOLIDAY SHE PASSED AT HOME ALSO HOW SHE HAD SEEN A COUNTESS AND A LORD SOME DAYS BEFORE AND HOW THE LORD WAS MUCH ABOUT AS TALL AS PETER AT WHICH PETER PULLED UP HIS COLLARS SO HIGH THAT YOU COULDNT HAVE SEEN HIS HEAD IF YOU HAD BEEN THERE ALL THIS TIME THE CHESTNUTS AND THE JUG WENT ROUND AND ROUND AND BYANDBYE THEY HAD A SONG ABOUT A LOST CHILD TRAVELLING IN THE SNOW FROM TINY TIM WHO HAD A PLAINTIVE LITTLE VOICE AND SANG IT VERY WELL INDEED THERE WAS NOTHING OF HIGH MARK IN THIS THEY WERE NOT A HANDSOME FAMILY THEY WERE NOT WELL DRESSED THEIR SHOES WERE FAR FROM BEING WATERPROOF THEIR CLOTHES WERE SCANTY AND PETER MIGHT HAVE KNOWN AND VERY LIKELY DID THE INSIDE OF A PAWNBROKERS BUT THEY WERE HAPPY GRATEFUL PLEASED WITH ONE ANOTHER AND CONTENTED WITH THE TIME AND WHEN THEY FADED AND LOOKED HAPPIER YET IN THE BRIGHT SPRINKLINGS OF THE SPIRITS TORCH AT PARTING SCROOGE HAD HIS EYE UPON THEM AND ESPECIALLY ON TINY TIM UNTIL THE LAST BY THIS TIME IT WAS GETTING DARK AND SNOWING PRETTY HEAVILY AND AS SCROOGE AND THE SPIRIT WENT ALONG THE STREETS THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE ROARING FIRES IN KITCHENS PARLOURS AND ALL SORTS OF ROOMS WAS WONDERFUL HERE THE FLICKERING OF THE BLAZE SHOWED PREPARATIONS FOR A COSY DINNER WITH HOT PLATES BAKING THROUGH AND THROUGH BEFORE THE FIRE AND DEEP RED CURTAINS READY TO BE DRAWN TO SHUT OUT COLD AND DARKNESS THERE ALL THE CHILDREN OF THE HOUSE WERE RUNNING OUT INTO THE SNOW TO MEET THEIR MARRIED SISTERS BROTHERS COUSINS UNCLES AUNTS AND BE THE FIRST TO GREET THEM HERE AGAIN WERE SHADOWS ON THE WINDOWBLIND OF GUESTS ASSEMBLING AND THERE A GROUP OF HANDSOME GIRLS ALL HOODED AND FURBOOTED AND ALL CHATTERING AT ONCE TRIPPED LIGHTLY OFF TO SOME NEAR NEIGHBOURS HOUSE WHERE WOE UPON THE SINGLE MAN WHO SAW THEM ENTERARTFUL WITCHES WELL THEY KNEW ITIN A GLOW BUT IF YOU HAD JUDGED FROM THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ON THEIR WAY TO FRIENDLY GATHERINGS YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT NO ONE WAS AT HOME TO GIVE THEM WELCOME WHEN THEY GOT THERE INSTEAD OF EVERY HOUSE EXPECTING COMPANY AND PILING UP ITS FIRES HALFCHIMNEY HIGH BLESSINGS ON IT HOW THE GHOST EXULTED HOW IT BARED ITS BREADTH OF BREAST AND OPENED ITS CAPACIOUS PALM AND FLOATED ON OUTPOURING WITH A GENEROUS HAND ITS BRIGHT AND HARMLESS MIRTH ON EVERYTHING WITHIN ITS REACH THE VERY LAMPLIGHTER WHO RAN ON BEFORE DOTTING THE DUSKY STREET WITH SPECKS OF LIGHT AND WHO WAS DRESSED TO SPEND THE EVENING SOMEWHERE LAUGHED OUT LOUDLY AS THE SPIRIT PASSED THOUGH LITTLE KENNED THE LAMPLIGHTER THAT HE HAD ANY COMPANY BUT CHRISTMAS AND NOW WITHOUT A WORD OF WARNING FROM THE GHOST THEY STOOD UPON A BLEAK AND DESERT MOOR WHERE MONSTROUS MASSES OF RUDE STONE WERE CAST ABOUT AS THOUGH IT WERE THE BURIALPLACE OF GIANTS AND WATER SPREAD ITSELF WHERESOEVER IT LISTED OR WOULD HAVE DONE SO BUT FOR THE FROST THAT HELD IT PRISONER AND NOTHING GREW BUT MOSS AND FURZE AND COARSE RANK GRASS DOWN IN THE WEST THE SETTING SUN HAD LEFT A STREAK OF FIERY RED WHICH GLARED UPON THE DESOLATION FOR AN INSTANT LIKE A SULLEN EYE AND FROWNING LOWER LOWER LOWER YET WAS LOST IN THE THICK GLOOM OF DARKEST NIGHT WHAT PLACE IS THIS ASKED SCROOGE A PLACE WHERE MINERS LIVE WHO LABOUR IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH RETURNED THE SPIRIT BUT THEY KNOW ME SEE A LIGHT SHONE FROM THE WINDOW OF A HUT AND SWIFTLY THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS IT PASSING THROUGH THE WALL OF MUD AND STONE THEY FOUND A CHEERFUL COMPANY ASSEMBLED ROUND A GLOWING FIRE AN OLD OLD MAN AND WOMAN WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDRENS CHILDREN AND ANOTHER GENERATION BEYOND THAT ALL DECKED OUT GAILY IN THEIR HOLIDAY ATTIRE THE OLD MAN IN A VOICE THAT SELDOM ROSE ABOVE THE HOWLING OF THE WIND UPON THE BARREN WASTE WAS SINGING THEM A CHRISTMAS SONGIT HAD BEEN A VERY OLD SONG WHEN HE WAS A BOYAND FROM TIME TO TIME THEY ALL JOINED IN THE CHORUS SO SURELY AS THEY RAISED THEIR VOICES THE OLD MAN GOT QUITE BLITHE AND LOUD AND SO SURELY AS THEY STOPPED HIS VIGOUR SANK AGAIN THE SPIRIT DID NOT TARRY HERE BUT BADE SCROOGE HOLD HIS ROBE AND PASSING ON ABOVE THE MOOR SPEDWHITHER NOT TO SEA TO SEA TO SCROOGES HORROR LOOKING BACK HE SAW THE LAST OF THE LAND A FRIGHTFUL RANGE OF ROCKS BEHIND THEM AND HIS EARS WERE DEAFENED BY THE THUNDERING OF WATER AS IT ROLLED AND ROARED AND RAGED AMONG THE DREADFUL CAVERNS IT HAD WORN AND FIERCELY TRIED TO UNDERMINE THE EARTH BUILT UPON A DISMAL REEF OF SUNKEN ROCKS SOME LEAGUE OR SO FROM SHORE ON WHICH THE WATERS CHAFED AND DASHED THE WILD YEAR THROUGH THERE STOOD A SOLITARY LIGHTHOUSE GREAT HEAPS OF SEAWEED CLUNG TO ITS BASE AND STORMBIRDS BORN OF THE WIND ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE AS SEAWEED OF THE WATERROSE AND FELL ABOUT IT LIKE THE WAVES THEY SKIMMED BUT EVEN HERE TWO MEN WHO WATCHED THE LIGHT HAD MADE A FIRE THAT THROUGH THE LOOPHOLE IN THE THICK STONE WALL SHED OUT A RAY OF BRIGHTNESS ON THE AWFUL SEA JOINING THEIR HORNY HANDS OVER THE ROUGH TABLE AT WHICH THEY SAT THEY WISHED EACH OTHER MERRY CHRISTMAS IN THEIR CAN OF GROG AND ONE OF THEM THE ELDER TOO WITH HIS FACE ALL DAMAGED AND SCARRED WITH HARD WEATHER AS THE FIGUREHEAD OF AN OLD SHIP MIGHT BE STRUCK UP A STURDY SONG THAT WAS LIKE A GALE IN ITSELF AGAIN THE GHOST SPED ON ABOVE THE BLACK AND HEAVING SEA ON ONUNTIL BEING FAR AWAY AS HE TOLD SCROOGE FROM ANY SHORE THEY LIGHTED ON A SHIP THEY STOOD BESIDE THE HELMSMAN AT THE WHEEL THE LOOKOUT IN THE BOW THE OFFICERS WHO HAD THE WATCH DARK GHOSTLY FIGURES IN THEIR SEVERAL STATIONS BUT EVERY MAN AMONG THEM HUMMED A CHRISTMAS TUNE OR HAD A CHRISTMAS THOUGHT OR SPOKE BELOW HIS BREATH TO HIS COMPANION OF SOME BYGONE CHRISTMAS DAY WITH HOMEWARD HOPES BELONGING TO IT AND EVERY MAN ON BOARD WAKING OR SLEEPING GOOD OR BAD HAD HAD A KINDER WORD FOR ANOTHER ON THAT DAY THAN ON ANY DAY IN THE YEAR AND HAD SHARED TO SOME EXTENT IN ITS FESTIVITIES AND HAD REMEMBERED THOSE HE CARED FOR AT A DISTANCE AND HAD KNOWN THAT THEY DELIGHTED TO REMEMBER HIM IT WAS A GREAT SURPRISE TO SCROOGE WHILE LISTENING TO THE MOANING OF THE WIND AND THINKING WHAT A SOLEMN THING IT WAS TO MOVE ON THROUGH THE LONELY DARKNESS OVER AN UNKNOWN ABYSS WHOSE DEPTHS WERE SECRETS AS PROFOUND AS DEATH IT WAS A GREAT SURPRISE TO SCROOGE WHILE THUS ENGAGED TO HEAR A HEARTY LAUGH IT WAS A MUCH GREATER SURPRISE TO SCROOGE TO RECOGNISE IT AS HIS OWN NEPHEWS AND TO FIND HIMSELF IN A BRIGHT DRY GLEAMING ROOM WITH THE SPIRIT STANDING SMILING BY HIS SIDE AND LOOKING AT THAT SAME NEPHEW WITH APPROVING AFFABILITY HA HA LAUGHED SCROOGES NEPHEW HA HA HA IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN BY ANY UNLIKELY CHANCE TO KNOW A MAN MORE BLEST IN A LAUGH THAN SCROOGES NEPHEW ALL I CAN SAY IS I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HIM TOO INTRODUCE HIM TO ME AND ILL CULTIVATE HIS ACQUAINTANCE IT IS A FAIR EVENHANDED NOBLE ADJUSTMENT OF THINGS THAT WHILE THERE IS INFECTION IN DISEASE AND SORROW THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD SO IRRESISTIBLY CONTAGIOUS AS LAUGHTER AND GOODHUMOUR WHEN SCROOGES NEPHEW LAUGHED IN THIS WAY HOLDING HIS SIDES ROLLING HIS HEAD AND TWISTING HIS FACE INTO THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT CONTORTIONS SCROOGES NIECE BY MARRIAGE LAUGHED AS HEARTILY AS HE AND THEIR ASSEMBLED FRIENDS BEING NOT A BIT BEHINDHAND ROARED OUT LUSTILY HA HA HA HA HA HA HE SAID THAT CHRISTMAS WAS A HUMBUG AS I LIVE CRIED SCROOGES NEPHEW HE BELIEVED IT TOO MORE SHAME FOR HIM FRED SAID SCROOGES NIECE INDIGNANTLY BLESS THOSE WOMEN THEY NEVER DO ANYTHING BY HALVES THEY ARE ALWAYS IN EARNEST SHE WAS VERY PRETTY EXCEEDINGLY PRETTY WITH A DIMPLED SURPRISEDLOOKING CAPITAL FACE A RIPE LITTLE MOUTH THAT SEEMED MADE TO BE KISSEDAS NO DOUBT IT WAS ALL KINDS OF GOOD LITTLE DOTS ABOUT HER CHIN THAT MELTED INTO ONE ANOTHER WHEN SHE LAUGHED AND THE SUNNIEST PAIR OF EYES YOU EVER SAW IN ANY LITTLE CREATURES HEAD ALTOGETHER SHE WAS WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE CALLED PROVOKING YOU KNOW BUT SATISFACTORY TOO OH PERFECTLY SATISFACTORY HES A COMICAL OLD FELLOW SAID SCROOGES NEPHEW THATS THE TRUTH AND NOT SO PLEASANT AS HE MIGHT BE HOWEVER HIS OFFENCES CARRY THEIR OWN PUNISHMENT AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST HIM IM SURE HE IS VERY RICH FRED HINTED SCROOGES NIECE AT LEAST YOU ALWAYS TELL ME SO WHAT OF THAT MY DEAR SAID SCROOGES NEPHEW HIS WEALTH IS OF NO USE TO HIM HE DONT DO ANY GOOD WITH IT HE DONT MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WITH IT HE HASNT THE SATISFACTION OF THINKINGHA HA HATHAT HE IS EVER GOING TO BENEFIT US WITH IT I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH HIM OBSERVED SCROOGES NIECE SCROOGES NIECES SISTERS AND ALL THE OTHER LADIES EXPRESSED THE SAME OPINION OH I HAVE SAID SCROOGES NEPHEW I AM SORRY FOR HIM I COULDNT BE ANGRY WITH HIM IF I TRIED WHO SUFFERS BY HIS ILL WHIMS HIMSELF ALWAYS HERE HE TAKES IT INTO HIS HEAD TO DISLIKE US AND HE WONT COME AND DINE WITH US WHATS THE CONSEQUENCE HE DONT LOSE MUCH OF A DINNER INDEED I THINK HE LOSES A VERY GOOD DINNER INTERRUPTED SCROOGES NIECE EVERYBODY ELSE SAID THE SAME AND THEY MUST BE ALLOWED TO HAVE BEEN COMPETENT JUDGES BECAUSE THEY HAD JUST HAD DINNER AND WITH THE DESSERT UPON THE TABLE WERE CLUSTERED ROUND THE FIRE BY LAMPLIGHT WELL IM VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT SAID SCROOGES NEPHEW BECAUSE I HAVENT GREAT FAITH IN THESE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS WHAT DO YOU SAY TOPPER TOPPER HAD CLEARLY GOT HIS EYE UPON ONE OF SCROOGES NIECES SISTERS FOR HE ANSWERED THAT A BACHELOR WAS A WRETCHED OUTCAST WHO HAD NO RIGHT TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE SUBJECT WHEREAT SCROOGES NIECES SISTERTHE PLUMP ONE WITH THE LACE TUCKER NOT THE ONE WITH THE ROSESBLUSHED DO GO ON FRED SAID SCROOGES NIECE CLAPPING HER HANDS HE NEVER FINISHES WHAT HE BEGINS TO SAY HE IS SUCH A RIDICULOUS FELLOW SCROOGES NEPHEW REVELLED IN ANOTHER LAUGH AND AS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THE INFECTION OFF THOUGH THE PLUMP SISTER TRIED HARD TO DO IT WITH AROMATIC VINEGAR HIS EXAMPLE WAS UNANIMOUSLY FOLLOWED I WAS ONLY GOING TO SAY SAID SCROOGES NEPHEW THAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS TAKING A DISLIKE TO US AND NOT MAKING MERRY WITH US IS AS I THINK THAT HE LOSES SOME PLEASANT MOMENTS WHICH COULD DO HIM NO HARM I AM SURE HE LOSES PLEASANTER COMPANIONS THAN HE CAN FIND IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS EITHER IN HIS MOULDY OLD OFFICE OR HIS DUSTY CHAMBERS I MEAN TO GIVE HIM THE SAME CHANCE EVERY YEAR WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT FOR I PITY HIM HE MAY RAIL AT CHRISTMAS TILL HE DIES BUT HE CANT HELP THINKING BETTER OF ITI DEFY HIMIF HE FINDS ME GOING THERE IN GOOD TEMPER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND SAYING UNCLE SCROOGE HOW ARE YOU IF IT ONLY PUTS HIM IN THE VEIN TO LEAVE HIS POOR CLERK FIFTY POUNDS THATS SOMETHING AND I THINK I SHOOK HIM YESTERDAY IT WAS THEIR TURN TO LAUGH NOW AT THE NOTION OF HIS SHAKING SCROOGE BUT BEING THOROUGHLY GOODNATURED AND NOT MUCH CARING WHAT THEY LAUGHED AT SO THAT THEY LAUGHED AT ANY RATE HE ENCOURAGED THEM IN THEIR MERRIMENT AND PASSED THE BOTTLE JOYOUSLY AFTER TEA THEY HAD SOME MUSIC FOR THEY WERE A MUSICAL FAMILY AND KNEW WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT WHEN THEY SUNG A GLEE OR CATCH I CAN ASSURE YOU ESPECIALLY TOPPER WHO COULD GROWL AWAY IN THE BASS LIKE A GOOD ONE AND NEVER SWELL THE LARGE VEINS IN HIS FOREHEAD OR GET RED IN THE FACE OVER IT SCROOGES NIECE PLAYED WELL UPON THE HARP AND PLAYED AMONG OTHER TUNES A SIMPLE LITTLE AIR A MERE NOTHING YOU MIGHT LEARN TO WHISTLE IT IN TWO MINUTES WHICH HAD BEEN FAMILIAR TO THE CHILD WHO FETCHED SCROOGE FROM THE BOARDINGSCHOOL AS HE HAD BEEN REMINDED BY THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST WHEN THIS STRAIN OF MUSIC SOUNDED ALL THE THINGS THAT GHOST HAD SHOWN HIM CAME UPON HIS MIND HE SOFTENED MORE AND MORE AND THOUGHT THAT IF HE COULD HAVE LISTENED TO IT OFTEN YEARS AGO HE MIGHT HAVE CULTIVATED THE KINDNESSES OF LIFE FOR HIS OWN HAPPINESS WITH HIS OWN HANDS WITHOUT RESORTING TO THE SEXTONS SPADE THAT BURIED JACOB MARLEY BUT THEY DIDNT DEVOTE THE WHOLE EVENING TO MUSIC AFTER A WHILE THEY PLAYED AT FORFEITS FOR IT IS GOOD TO BE CHILDREN SOMETIMES AND NEVER BETTER THAN AT CHRISTMAS WHEN ITS MIGHTY FOUNDER WAS A CHILD HIMSELF STOP THERE WAS FIRST A GAME AT BLINDMANS BUFF OF COURSE THERE WAS AND I NO MORE BELIEVE TOPPER WAS REALLY BLIND THAN I BELIEVE HE HAD EYES IN HIS BOOTS MY OPINION IS THAT IT WAS A DONE THING BETWEEN HIM AND SCROOGES NEPHEW AND THAT THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT KNEW IT THE WAY HE WENT AFTER THAT PLUMP SISTER IN THE LACE TUCKER WAS AN OUTRAGE ON THE CREDULITY OF HUMAN NATURE KNOCKING DOWN THE FIREIRONS TUMBLING OVER THE CHAIRS BUMPING AGAINST THE PIANO SMOTHERING HIMSELF AMONG THE CURTAINS WHEREVER SHE WENT THERE WENT HE HE ALWAYS KNEW WHERE THE PLUMP SISTER WAS HE WOULDNT CATCH ANYBODY ELSE IF YOU HAD FALLEN UP AGAINST HIM AS SOME OF THEM DID ON PURPOSE HE WOULD HAVE MADE A FEINT OF ENDEAVOURING TO SEIZE YOU WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AFFRONT TO YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND WOULD INSTANTLY HAVE SIDLED OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PLUMP SISTER SHE OFTEN CRIED OUT THAT IT WASNT FAIR AND IT REALLY WAS NOT BUT WHEN AT LAST HE CAUGHT HER WHEN IN SPITE OF ALL HER SILKEN RUSTLINGS AND HER RAPID FLUTTERINGS PAST HIM HE GOT HER INTO A CORNER WHENCE THERE WAS NO ESCAPE THEN HIS CONDUCT WAS THE MOST EXECRABLE FOR HIS PRETENDING NOT TO KNOW HER HIS PRETENDING THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO TOUCH HER HEADDRESS AND FURTHER TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF HER IDENTITY BY PRESSING A CERTAIN RING UPON HER FINGER AND A CERTAIN CHAIN ABOUT HER NECK WAS VILE MONSTROUS NO DOUBT SHE TOLD HIM HER OPINION OF IT WHEN ANOTHER BLINDMAN BEING IN OFFICE THEY WERE SO VERY CONFIDENTIAL TOGETHER BEHIND THE CURTAINS SCROOGES NIECE WAS NOT ONE OF THE BLINDMANS BUFF PARTY BUT WAS MADE COMFORTABLE WITH A LARGE CHAIR AND A FOOTSTOOL IN A SNUG CORNER WHERE THE GHOST AND SCROOGE WERE CLOSE BEHIND HER BUT SHE JOINED IN THE FORFEITS AND LOVED HER LOVE TO ADMIRATION WITH ALL THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET LIKEWISE AT THE GAME OF HOW WHEN AND WHERE SHE WAS VERY GREAT AND TO THE SECRET JOY OF SCROOGES NEPHEW BEAT HER SISTERS HOLLOW THOUGH THEY WERE SHARP GIRLS TOO AS TOPPER COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWENTY PEOPLE THERE YOUNG AND OLD BUT THEY ALL PLAYED AND SO DID SCROOGE FOR WHOLLY FORGETTING IN THE INTEREST HE HAD IN WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT HIS VOICE MADE NO SOUND IN THEIR EARS HE SOMETIMES CAME OUT WITH HIS GUESS QUITE LOUD AND VERY OFTEN GUESSED QUITE RIGHT TOO FOR THE SHARPEST NEEDLE BEST WHITECHAPEL WARRANTED NOT TO CUT IN THE EYE WAS NOT SHARPER THAN SCROOGE BLUNT AS HE TOOK IT IN HIS HEAD TO BE THE GHOST WAS GREATLY PLEASED TO FIND HIM IN THIS MOOD AND LOOKED UPON HIM WITH SUCH FAVOUR THAT HE BEGGED LIKE A BOY TO BE ALLOWED TO STAY UNTIL THE GUESTS DEPARTED BUT THIS THE SPIRIT SAID COULD NOT BE DONE HERE IS A NEW GAME SAID SCROOGE ONE HALF HOUR SPIRIT ONLY ONE IT WAS A GAME CALLED YES AND NO WHERE SCROOGES NEPHEW HAD TO THINK OF SOMETHING AND THE REST MUST FIND OUT WHAT HE ONLY ANSWERING TO THEIR QUESTIONS YES OR NO AS THE CASE WAS THE BRISK FIRE OF QUESTIONING TO WHICH HE WAS EXPOSED ELICITED FROM HIM THAT HE WAS THINKING OF AN ANIMAL A LIVE ANIMAL RATHER A DISAGREEABLE ANIMAL A SAVAGE ANIMAL AN ANIMAL THAT GROWLED AND GRUNTED SOMETIMES AND TALKED SOMETIMES AND LIVED IN LONDON AND WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS AND WASNT MADE A SHOW OF AND WASNT LED BY ANYBODY AND DIDNT LIVE IN A MENAGERIE AND WAS NEVER KILLED IN A MARKET AND WAS NOT A HORSE OR AN ASS OR A COW OR A BULL OR A TIGER OR A DOG OR A PIG OR A CAT OR A BEAR AT EVERY FRESH QUESTION THAT WAS PUT TO HIM THIS NEPHEW BURST INTO A FRESH ROAR OF LAUGHTER AND WAS SO INEXPRESSIBLY TICKLED THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO GET UP OFF THE SOFA AND STAMP AT LAST THE PLUMP SISTER FALLING INTO A SIMILAR STATE CRIED OUT I HAVE FOUND IT OUT I KNOW WHAT IT IS FRED I KNOW WHAT IT IS WHAT IS IT CRIED FRED ITS YOUR UNCLE SCROOOOOGE WHICH IT CERTAINLY WAS ADMIRATION WAS THE UNIVERSAL SENTIMENT THOUGH SOME OBJECTED THAT THE REPLY TO IS IT A BEAR OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN YES INASMUCH AS AN ANSWER IN THE NEGATIVE WAS SUFFICIENT TO HAVE DIVERTED THEIR THOUGHTS FROM MR SCROOGE SUPPOSING THEY HAD EVER HAD ANY TENDENCY THAT WAY HE HAS GIVEN US PLENTY OF MERRIMENT I AM SURE SAID FRED AND IT WOULD BE UNGRATEFUL NOT TO DRINK HIS HEALTH HERE IS A GLASS OF MULLED WINE READY TO OUR HAND AT THE MOMENT AND I SAY UNCLE SCROOGE WELL UNCLE SCROOGE THEY CRIED A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR TO THE OLD MAN WHATEVER HE IS SAID SCROOGES NEPHEW HE WOULDNT TAKE IT FROM ME BUT MAY HE HAVE IT NEVERTHELESS UNCLE SCROOGE UNCLE SCROOGE HAD IMPERCEPTIBLY BECOME SO GAY AND LIGHT OF HEART THAT HE WOULD HAVE PLEDGED THE UNCONSCIOUS COMPANY IN RETURN AND THANKED THEM IN AN INAUDIBLE SPEECH IF THE GHOST HAD GIVEN HIM TIME BUT THE WHOLE SCENE PASSED OFF IN THE BREATH OF THE LAST WORD SPOKEN BY HIS NEPHEW AND HE AND THE SPIRIT WERE AGAIN UPON THEIR TRAVELS MUCH THEY SAW AND FAR THEY WENT AND MANY HOMES THEY VISITED BUT ALWAYS WITH A HAPPY END THE SPIRIT STOOD BESIDE SICK BEDS AND THEY WERE CHEERFUL ON FOREIGN LANDS AND THEY WERE CLOSE AT HOME BY STRUGGLING MEN AND THEY WERE PATIENT IN THEIR GREATER HOPE BY POVERTY AND IT WAS RICH IN ALMSHOUSE HOSPITAL AND JAIL IN MISERYS EVERY REFUGE WHERE VAIN MAN IN HIS LITTLE BRIEF AUTHORITY HAD NOT MADE FAST THE DOOR AND BARRED THE SPIRIT OUT HE LEFT HIS BLESSING AND TAUGHT SCROOGE HIS PRECEPTS IT WAS A LONG NIGHT IF IT WERE ONLY A NIGHT BUT SCROOGE HAD HIS DOUBTS OF THIS BECAUSE THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS APPEARED TO BE CONDENSED INTO THE SPACE OF TIME THEY PASSED TOGETHER IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT WHILE SCROOGE REMAINED UNALTERED IN HIS OUTWARD FORM THE GHOST GREW OLDER CLEARLY OLDER SCROOGE HAD OBSERVED THIS CHANGE BUT NEVER SPOKE OF IT UNTIL THEY LEFT A CHILDRENS TWELFTH NIGHT PARTY WHEN LOOKING AT THE SPIRIT AS THEY STOOD TOGETHER IN AN OPEN PLACE HE NOTICED THAT ITS HAIR WAS GREY ARE SPIRITS LIVES SO SHORT ASKED SCROOGE MY LIFE UPON THIS GLOBE IS VERY BRIEF REPLIED THE GHOST IT ENDS TONIGHT TONIGHT CRIED SCROOGE TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT HARK THE TIME IS DRAWING NEAR THE CHIMES WERE RINGING THE THREE QUARTERS PAST ELEVEN AT THAT MOMENT FORGIVE ME IF I AM NOT JUSTIFIED IN WHAT I ASK SAID SCROOGE LOOKING INTENTLY AT THE SPIRITS ROBE BUT I SEE SOMETHING STRANGE AND NOT BELONGING TO YOURSELF PROTRUDING FROM YOUR SKIRTS IS IT A FOOT OR A CLAW IT MIGHT BE A CLAW FOR THE FLESH THERE IS UPON IT WAS THE SPIRITS SORROWFUL REPLY LOOK HERE FROM THE FOLDINGS OF ITS ROBE IT BROUGHT TWO CHILDREN WRETCHED ABJECT FRIGHTFUL HIDEOUS MISERABLE THEY KNELT DOWN AT ITS FEET AND CLUNG UPON THE OUTSIDE OF ITS GARMENT OH MAN LOOK HERE LOOK LOOK DOWN HERE EXCLAIMED THE GHOST THEY WERE A BOY AND GIRL YELLOW MEAGRE RAGGED SCOWLING WOLFISH BUT PROSTRATE TOO IN THEIR HUMILITY WHERE GRACEFUL YOUTH SHOULD HAVE FILLED THEIR FEATURES OUT AND TOUCHED THEM WITH ITS FRESHEST TINTS A STALE AND SHRIVELLED HAND LIKE THAT OF AGE HAD PINCHED AND TWISTED THEM AND PULLED THEM INTO SHREDS WHERE ANGELS MIGHT HAVE SAT ENTHRONED DEVILS LURKED AND GLARED OUT MENACING NO CHANGE NO DEGRADATION NO PERVERSION OF HUMANITY IN ANY GRADE THROUGH ALL THE MYSTERIES OF WONDERFUL CREATION HAS MONSTERS HALF SO HORRIBLE AND DREAD SCROOGE STARTED BACK APPALLED HAVING THEM SHOWN TO HIM IN THIS WAY HE TRIED TO SAY THEY WERE FINE CHILDREN BUT THE WORDS CHOKED THEMSELVES RATHER THAN BE PARTIES TO A LIE OF SUCH ENORMOUS MAGNITUDE SPIRIT ARE THEY YOURS SCROOGE COULD SAY NO MORE THEY ARE MANS SAID THE SPIRIT LOOKING DOWN UPON THEM AND THEY CLING TO ME APPEALING FROM THEIR FATHERS THIS BOY IS IGNORANCE THIS GIRL IS WANT BEWARE THEM BOTH AND ALL OF THEIR DEGREE BUT MOST OF ALL BEWARE THIS BOY FOR ON HIS BROW I SEE THAT WRITTEN WHICH IS DOOM UNLESS THE WRITING BE ERASED DENY IT CRIED THE SPIRIT STRETCHING OUT ITS HAND TOWARDS THE CITY SLANDER THOSE WHO TELL IT YE ADMIT IT FOR YOUR FACTIOUS PURPOSES AND MAKE IT WORSE AND BIDE THE END HAVE THEY NO REFUGE OR RESOURCE CRIED SCROOGE ARE THERE NO PRISONS SAID THE SPIRIT TURNING ON HIM FOR THE LAST TIME WITH HIS OWN WORDS ARE THERE NO WORKHOUSES THE BELL STRUCK TWELVE SCROOGE LOOKED ABOUT HIM FOR THE GHOST AND SAW IT NOT AS THE LAST STROKE CEASED TO VIBRATE HE REMEMBERED THE PREDICTION OF OLD JACOB MARLEY AND LIFTING UP HIS EYES BEHELD A SOLEMN PHANTOM DRAPED AND HOODED COMING LIKE A MIST ALONG THE GROUND TOWARDS HIM STAVE IV THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS THE PHANTOM SLOWLY GRAVELY SILENTLY APPROACHED WHEN IT CAME NEAR HIM SCROOGE BENT DOWN UPON HIS KNEE FOR IN THE VERY AIR THROUGH WHICH THIS SPIRIT MOVED IT SEEMED TO SCATTER GLOOM AND MYSTERY IT WAS SHROUDED IN A DEEP BLACK GARMENT WHICH CONCEALED ITS HEAD ITS FACE ITS FORM AND LEFT NOTHING OF IT VISIBLE SAVE ONE OUTSTRETCHED HAND BUT FOR THIS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO DETACH ITS FIGURE FROM THE NIGHT AND SEPARATE IT FROM THE DARKNESS BY WHICH IT WAS SURROUNDED HE FELT THAT IT WAS TALL AND STATELY WHEN IT CAME BESIDE HIM AND THAT ITS MYSTERIOUS PRESENCE FILLED HIM WITH A SOLEMN DREAD HE KNEW NO MORE FOR THE SPIRIT NEITHER SPOKE NOR MOVED I AM IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS YET TO COME SAID SCROOGE THE SPIRIT ANSWERED NOT BUT POINTED ONWARD WITH ITS HAND YOU ARE ABOUT TO SHOW ME SHADOWS OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE NOT HAPPENED BUT WILL HAPPEN IN THE TIME BEFORE US SCROOGE PURSUED IS THAT SO SPIRIT THE UPPER PORTION OF THE GARMENT WAS CONTRACTED FOR AN INSTANT IN ITS FOLDS AS IF THE SPIRIT HAD INCLINED ITS HEAD THAT WAS THE ONLY ANSWER HE RECEIVED ALTHOUGH WELL USED TO GHOSTLY COMPANY BY THIS TIME SCROOGE FEARED THE SILENT SHAPE SO MUCH THAT HIS LEGS TREMBLED BENEATH HIM AND HE FOUND THAT HE COULD HARDLY STAND WHEN HE PREPARED TO FOLLOW IT THE SPIRIT PAUSED A MOMENT AS OBSERVING HIS CONDITION AND GIVING HIM TIME TO RECOVER BUT SCROOGE WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR THIS IT THRILLED HIM WITH A VAGUE UNCERTAIN HORROR TO KNOW THAT BEHIND THE DUSKY SHROUD THERE WERE GHOSTLY EYES INTENTLY FIXED UPON HIM WHILE HE THOUGH HE STRETCHED HIS OWN TO THE UTMOST COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A SPECTRAL HAND AND ONE GREAT HEAP OF BLACK GHOST OF THE FUTURE HE EXCLAIMED I FEAR YOU MORE THAN ANY SPECTRE I HAVE SEEN BUT AS I KNOW YOUR PURPOSE IS TO DO ME GOOD AND AS I HOPE TO LIVE TO BE ANOTHER MAN FROM WHAT I WAS I AM PREPARED TO BEAR YOU COMPANY AND DO IT WITH A THANKFUL HEART WILL YOU NOT SPEAK TO ME IT GAVE HIM NO REPLY THE HAND WAS POINTED STRAIGHT BEFORE THEM LEAD ON SAID SCROOGE LEAD ON THE NIGHT IS WANING FAST AND IT IS PRECIOUS TIME TO ME I KNOW LEAD ON SPIRIT THE PHANTOM MOVED AWAY AS IT HAD COME TOWARDS HIM SCROOGE FOLLOWED IN THE SHADOW OF ITS DRESS WHICH BORE HIM UP HE THOUGHT AND CARRIED HIM ALONG THEY SCARCELY SEEMED TO ENTER THE CITY FOR THE CITY RATHER SEEMED TO SPRING UP ABOUT THEM AND ENCOMPASS THEM OF ITS OWN ACT BUT THERE THEY WERE IN THE HEART OF IT ON CHANGE AMONGST THE MERCHANTS WHO HURRIED UP AND DOWN AND CHINKED THE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS AND CONVERSED IN GROUPS AND LOOKED AT THEIR WATCHES AND TRIFLED THOUGHTFULLY WITH THEIR GREAT GOLD SEALS AND SO FORTH AS SCROOGE HAD SEEN THEM OFTEN THE SPIRIT STOPPED BESIDE ONE LITTLE KNOT OF BUSINESS MEN OBSERVING THAT THE HAND WAS POINTED TO THEM SCROOGE ADVANCED TO LISTEN TO THEIR TALK NO SAID A GREAT FAT MAN WITH A MONSTROUS CHIN I DONT KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT EITHER WAY I ONLY KNOW HES DEAD WHEN DID HE DIE INQUIRED ANOTHER LAST NIGHT I BELIEVE WHY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM ASKED A THIRD TAKING A VAST QUANTITY OF SNUFF OUT OF A VERY LARGE SNUFFBOX I THOUGHT HED NEVER DIE GOD KNOWS SAID THE FIRST WITH A YAWN WHAT HAS HE DONE WITH HIS MONEY ASKED A REDFACED GENTLEMAN WITH A PENDULOUS EXCRESCENCE ON THE END OF HIS NOSE THAT SHOOK LIKE THE GILLS OF A TURKEYCOCK I HAVENT HEARD SAID THE MAN WITH THE LARGE CHIN YAWNING AGAIN LEFT IT TO HIS COMPANY PERHAPS HE HASNT LEFT IT TO ME THATS ALL I KNOW THIS PLEASANTRY WAS RECEIVED WITH A GENERAL LAUGH ITS LIKELY TO BE A VERY CHEAP FUNERAL SAID THE SAME SPEAKER FOR UPON MY LIFE I DONT KNOW OF ANYBODY TO GO TO IT SUPPOSE WE MAKE UP A PARTY AND VOLUNTEER I DONT MIND GOING IF A LUNCH IS PROVIDED OBSERVED THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE EXCRESCENCE ON HIS NOSE BUT I MUST BE FED IF I MAKE ONE ANOTHER LAUGH WELL I AM THE MOST DISINTERESTED AMONG YOU AFTER ALL SAID THE FIRST SPEAKER FOR I NEVER WEAR BLACK GLOVES AND I NEVER EAT LUNCH BUT ILL OFFER TO GO IF ANYBODY ELSE WILL WHEN I COME TO THINK OF IT IM NOT AT ALL SURE THAT I WASNT HIS MOST PARTICULAR FRIEND FOR WE USED TO STOP AND SPEAK WHENEVER WE MET BYE BYE SPEAKERS AND LISTENERS STROLLED AWAY AND MIXED WITH OTHER GROUPS SCROOGE KNEW THE MEN AND LOOKED TOWARDS THE SPIRIT FOR AN EXPLANATION THE PHANTOM GLIDED ON INTO A STREET ITS FINGER POINTED TO TWO PERSONS MEETING SCROOGE LISTENED AGAIN THINKING THAT THE EXPLANATION MIGHT LIE HERE HE KNEW THESE MEN ALSO PERFECTLY THEY WERE MEN OF BUSINESS VERY WEALTHY AND OF GREAT IMPORTANCE HE HAD MADE A POINT ALWAYS OF STANDING WELL IN THEIR ESTEEM IN A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW THAT IS STRICTLY IN A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW HOW ARE YOU SAID ONE HOW ARE YOU RETURNED THE OTHER WELL SAID THE FIRST OLD SCRATCH HAS GOT HIS OWN AT LAST HEY SO I AM TOLD RETURNED THE SECOND COLD ISNT IT SEASONABLE FOR CHRISTMAS TIME YOURE NOT A SKATER I SUPPOSE NO NO SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK OF GOOD MORNING NOT ANOTHER WORD THAT WAS THEIR MEETING THEIR CONVERSATION AND THEIR PARTING SCROOGE WAS AT FIRST INCLINED TO BE SURPRISED THAT THE SPIRIT SHOULD ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO CONVERSATIONS APPARENTLY SO TRIVIAL BUT FEELING ASSURED THAT THEY MUST HAVE SOME HIDDEN PURPOSE HE SET HIMSELF TO CONSIDER WHAT IT WAS LIKELY TO BE THEY COULD SCARCELY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY BEARING ON THE DEATH OF JACOB HIS OLD PARTNER FOR THAT WAS PAST AND THIS GHOSTS PROVINCE WAS THE FUTURE NOR COULD HE THINK OF ANY ONE IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED WITH HIMSELF TO WHOM HE COULD APPLY THEM BUT NOTHING DOUBTING THAT TO WHOMSOEVER THEY APPLIED THEY HAD SOME LATENT MORAL FOR HIS OWN IMPROVEMENT HE RESOLVED TO TREASURE UP EVERY WORD HE HEARD AND EVERYTHING HE SAW AND ESPECIALLY TO OBSERVE THE SHADOW OF HIMSELF WHEN IT APPEARED FOR HE HAD AN EXPECTATION THAT THE CONDUCT OF HIS FUTURE SELF WOULD GIVE HIM THE CLUE HE MISSED AND WOULD RENDER THE SOLUTION OF THESE RIDDLES EASY HE LOOKED ABOUT IN THAT VERY PLACE FOR HIS OWN IMAGE BUT ANOTHER MAN STOOD IN HIS ACCUSTOMED CORNER AND THOUGH THE CLOCK POINTED TO HIS USUAL TIME OF DAY FOR BEING THERE HE SAW NO LIKENESS OF HIMSELF AMONG THE MULTITUDES THAT POURED IN THROUGH THE PORCH IT GAVE HIM LITTLE SURPRISE HOWEVER FOR HE HAD BEEN REVOLVING IN HIS MIND A CHANGE OF LIFE AND THOUGHT AND HOPED HE SAW HIS NEWBORN RESOLUTIONS CARRIED OUT IN THIS QUIET AND DARK BESIDE HIM STOOD THE PHANTOM WITH ITS OUTSTRETCHED HAND WHEN HE ROUSED HIMSELF FROM HIS THOUGHTFUL QUEST HE FANCIED FROM THE TURN OF THE HAND AND ITS SITUATION IN REFERENCE TO HIMSELF THAT THE UNSEEN EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM KEENLY IT MADE HIM SHUDDER AND FEEL VERY COLD THEY LEFT THE BUSY SCENE AND WENT INTO AN OBSCURE PART OF THE TOWN WHERE SCROOGE HAD NEVER PENETRATED BEFORE ALTHOUGH HE RECOGNISED ITS SITUATION AND ITS BAD REPUTE THE WAYS WERE FOUL AND NARROW THE SHOPS AND HOUSES WRETCHED THE PEOPLE HALFNAKED DRUNKEN SLIPSHOD UGLY ALLEYS AND ARCHWAYS LIKE SO MANY CESSPOOLS DISGORGED THEIR OFFENCES OF SMELL AND DIRT AND LIFE UPON THE STRAGGLING STREETS AND THE WHOLE QUARTER REEKED WITH CRIME WITH FILTH AND MISERY FAR IN THIS DEN OF INFAMOUS RESORT THERE WAS A LOWBROWED BEETLING SHOP BELOW A PENTHOUSE ROOF WHERE IRON OLD RAGS BOTTLES BONES AND GREASY OFFAL WERE BOUGHT UPON THE FLOOR WITHIN WERE PILED UP HEAPS OF RUSTY KEYS NAILS CHAINS HINGES FILES SCALES WEIGHTS AND REFUSE IRON OF ALL KINDS SECRETS THAT FEW WOULD LIKE TO SCRUTINISE WERE BRED AND HIDDEN IN MOUNTAINS OF UNSEEMLY RAGS MASSES OF CORRUPTED FAT AND SEPULCHRES OF BONES SITTING

MISCELLANEOUS TATTERS HUNG UPON A LINE AND SMOKED HIS PIPE IN ALL THE LUXURY OF CALM RETIREMENT SCROOGE AND THE PHANTOM CAME INTO THE PRESENCE OF THIS MAN JUST AS A WOMAN WITH A HEAVY BUNDLE SLUNK INTO THE SHOP BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY ENTERED WHEN ANOTHER WOMAN SIMILARLY LADEN CAME IN TOO AND SHE WAS CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A MAN IN FADED BLACK WHO WAS NO LESS STARTLED BY THE SIGHT OF THEM THAN THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE RECOGNITION OF EACH OTHER AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF BLANK ASTONISHMENT IN WHICH THE OLD MAN WITH THE PIPE HAD JOINED THEM THEY ALL THREE BURST INTO A LAUGH LET THE CHARWOMAN ALONE TO

DIALOGUE IN HORROR AS THEY SAT GROUPED ABOUT THEIR SPOIL IN THE SCANTY LIGHT AFFORDED BY THE OLD MANS LAMP HE VIEWED THEM WITH A DETESTATION AND DISGUST WHICH COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN GREATER THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN OBSCENE DEMONS MARKETING THE CORPSE ITSELF HA HA LAUGHED THE SAME WOMAN WHEN OLD JOE PRODUCING A FLANNEL BAG WITH MONEY IN IT TOLD OUT THEIR SEVERAL GAINS UPON THE GROUND THIS IS THE END

MIGHT BE MY OWN MY LIFE TENDS THAT WAY NOW MERCIFUL HEAVEN WHAT IS THIS HE RECOILED IN TERROR FOR THE SCENE HAD CHANGED AND NOW HE ALMOST TOUCHED A BED A BARE UNCURTAINED BED ON WHICH BENEATH A RAGGED SHEET THERE LAY A SOMETHING COVERED UP WHICH THOUGH IT WAS DUMB ANNOUNCED ITSELF IN AWFUL LANGUAGE THE ROOM WAS VERY DARK TOO DARK TO BE OBSERVED WITH ANY ACCURACY THOUGH SCROOGE GLANCED ROUND IT IN OBEDIENCE TO A SECRET IMPULSE ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF ROOM IT WAS A PALE LIGHT RISING IN THE OUTER AIR FELL STRAIGHT UPON THE BED AND ON IT PLUNDERED AND BEREFT UNWATCHED UNWEPT UNCARED FOR WAS THE BODY OF THIS MAN SCROOGE GLANCED TOWARDS THE PHANTOM ITS STEADY HAND WAS POINTED TO THE HEAD THE COVER WAS SO CARELESSLY ADJUSTED THAT THE SLIGHTEST RAISING OF IT THE MOTION OF A FINGER UPON SCROOGES PART WOULD HAVE DISCLOSED THE FACE HE THOUGHT OF IT FELT HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO DO AND LONGED TO DO IT BUT HAD NO MORE POWER TO WITHDRAW THE VEIL THAN TO DISMISS THE SPECTRE AT HIS SIDE OH COLD COLD RIGID DREADFUL DEATH SET UP THINE ALTAR HERE AND DRESS IT WITH SUCH TERRORS AS THOU HAST AT THY COMMAND FOR THIS IS THY DOMINION BUT OF THE LOVED REVERED AND HONOURED HEAD THOU CANST NOT TURN ONE HAIR TO THY DREAD PURPOSES OR MAKE ONE FEATURE ODIOUS IT IS NOT THAT THE HAND IS HEAVY AND WILL FALL DOWN WHEN RELEASED IT IS NOT THAT THE HEART AND PULSE ARE STILL BUT THAT THE HAND WAS OPEN GENEROUS AND TRUE THE HEART BRAVE WARM AND TENDER AND THE PULSE A MANS STRIKE SHADOW STRIKE AND SEE HIS GOOD DEEDS SPRINGING FROM THE WOUND TO SOW THE WORLD WITH LIFE IMMORTAL NO VOICE PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS IN SCROOGES EARS AND YET HE HEARD THEM WHEN HE LOOKED UPON THE BED HE THOUGHT IF THIS MAN COULD BE RAISED UP NOW WHAT WOULD BE HIS FOREMOST THOUGHTS AVARICE HARDDEALING GRIPING CARES THEY HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO A RICH END TRULY HE LAY IN THE DARK EMPTY HOUSE WITH NOT A MAN A WOMAN OR A CHILD TO SAY THAT HE WAS KIND TO ME IN THIS OR THAT AND FOR THE MEMORY OF ONE KIND WORD I WILL BE KIND TO HIM A CAT WAS TEARING AT THE DOOR AND THERE WAS A SOUND OF GNAWING RATS BENEATH THE HEARTHSTONE WHAT THEY WANTED IN THE ROOM OF DEATH AND WHY THEY WERE SO RESTLESS AND DISTURBED SCROOGE DID NOT DARE TO THINK SPIRIT HE SAID THIS IS A FEARFUL PLACE IN LEAVING IT I SHALL NOT LEAVE ITS LESSON TRUST ME LET US GO STILL THE GHOST POINTED WITH AN UNMOVED FINGER TO THE HEAD I UNDERSTAND YOU SCROOGE RETURNED AND I WOULD DO IT IF I COULD BUT I HAVE NOT THE POWER SPIRIT I HAVE NOT THE POWER AGAIN IT SEEMED TO LOOK UPON HIM IF THERE IS ANY PERSON IN THE TOWN WHO FEELS EMOTION CAUSED BY THIS MANS DEATH SAID SCROOGE QUITE AGONISED SHOW THAT PERSON TO ME SPIRIT I BESEECH YOU THE PHANTOM SPREAD ITS DARK ROBE BEFORE HIM FOR A MOMENT LIKE A WING AND WITHDRAWING IT REVEALED A ROOM BY DAYLIGHT WHERE A MOTHER AND HER CHILDREN WERE SHE WAS EXPECTING SOME ONE AND WITH ANXIOUS EAGERNESS FOR SHE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM STARTED AT EVERY SOUND LOOKED OUT FROM THE WINDOW GLANCED AT THE CLOCK TRIED BUT IN VAIN TO WORK WITH HER NEEDLE AND COULD HARDLY BEAR THE VOICES OF THE CHILDREN IN THEIR PLAY AT LENGTH THE LONGEXPECTED KNOCK WAS HEARD SHE HURRIED TO THE DOOR AND MET HER HUSBAND A MAN WHOSE FACE WAS CAREWORN AND DEPRESSED THOUGH HE WAS YOUNG THERE WAS A REMARKABLE EXPRESSION IN IT NOW A KIND OF SERIOUS DELIGHT OF WHICH HE FELT ASHAMED AND WHICH HE STRUGGLED TO REPRESS HE SAT DOWN TO THE DINNER THAT HAD BEEN HOARDING FOR HIM BY THE FIRE AND WHEN SHE ASKED HIM FAINTLY WHAT NEWS WHICH WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER A LONG SILENCE HE APPEARED EMBARRASSED HOW TO ANSWER IS IT GOOD SHE SAID OR BADTO HELP HIM BAD HE ANSWERED WE ARE QUITE RUINED NO THERE IS HOPE YET CAROLINE IF HE RELENTS SHE SAID AMAZED THERE IS NOTHING IS PAST HOPE IF SUCH A MIRACLE HAS HAPPENED HE IS PAST RELENTING SAID HER HUSBAND HE IS DEAD SHE WAS A MILD AND PATIENT CREATURE IF HER FACE SPOKE TRUTH BUT SHE WAS THANKFUL IN HER SOUL TO HEAR IT AND SHE SAID SO WITH CLASPED HANDS SHE PRAYED FORGIVENESS THE NEXT MOMENT AND WAS SORRY BUT THE FIRST WAS THE EMOTION OF HER HEART WHAT THE HALFDRUNKEN WOMAN WHOM I TOLD YOU OF LAST NIGHT SAID TO ME WHEN I TRIED TO SEE HIM AND OBTAIN A WEEKS DELAY AND WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A MERE EXCUSE TO AVOID ME TURNS OUT TO HAVE BEEN QUITE TRUE HE WAS NOT ONLY VERY ILL BUT DYING THEN TO WHOM WILL OUR DEBT BE TRANSFERRED I DONT KNOW BUT BEFORE THAT TIME WE SHALL BE READY WITH THE MONEY AND EVEN THOUGH WE WERE NOT IT WOULD BE A BAD FORTUNE INDEED TO FIND SO MERCILESS A CREDITOR IN HIS SUCCESSOR WE MAY SLEEP TONIGHT WITH LIGHT HEARTS CAROLINE YES SOFTEN IT AS THEY WOULD THEIR HEARTS WERE LIGHTER THE CHILDRENS FACES HUSHED AND CLUSTERED ROUND TO HEAR WHAT THEY SO LITTLE UNDERSTOOD WERE BRIGHTER AND IT WAS A HAPPIER HOUSE FOR THIS MANS DEATH THE ONLY EMOTION THAT THE GHOST COULD SHOW HIM CAUSED BY THE EVENT WAS ONE OF PLEASURE LET ME SEE SOME TENDERNESS CONNECTED WITH A DEATH SAID SCROOGE OR THAT DARK CHAMBER SPIRIT WHICH WE LEFT JUST NOW WILL BE FOR EVER PRESENT TO ME THE GHOST
