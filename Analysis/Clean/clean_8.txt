BIRTH AMONG OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS IN A CERTAIN TOWN WHICH FOR MANY REASONS IT WILL BE PRUDENT TO REFRAIN FROM MENTIONING AND TO WHICH I WILL ASSIGN NO FICTITIOUS NAME THERE IS ONE ANCIENTLY COMMON TO MOST TOWNS GREAT OR SMALL TO WIT A WORKHOUSE AND IN THIS WORKHOUSE WAS BORN ON A DAY AND DATE WHICH I NEED NOT TROUBLE MYSELF TO REPEAT INASMUCH AS IT CAN BE OF NO POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCE TO THE READER IN THIS STAGE OF THE BUSINESS AT ALL EVENTS THE ITEM OF MORTALITY WHOSE NAME IS PREFIXED TO THE HEAD OF THIS CHAPTER FOR A LONG TIME AFTER IT WAS USHERED INTO THIS WORLD OF SORROW AND TROUBLE BY THE PARISH SURGEON IT REMAINED A MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE DOUBT WHETHER THE CHILD WOULD SURVIVE TO BEAR ANY NAME AT ALL IN WHICH CASE IT IS SOMEWHAT MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THESE MEMOIRS WOULD NEVER HAVE APPEARED OR IF THEY HAD THAT BEING COMPRISED WITHIN A COUPLE OF PAGES THEY WOULD HAVE POSSESSED THE INESTIMABLE MERIT OF BEING THE MOST CONCISE AND FAITHFUL SPECIMEN OF BIOGRAPHY EXTANT IN THE LITERATURE OF ANY AGE OR COUNTRY ALTHOUGH I AM NOT DISPOSED TO MAINTAIN THAT THE BEING BORN IN A WORKHOUSE IS IN ITSELF THE MOST FORTUNATE AND ENVIABLE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT CAN POSSIBLY BEFALL A HUMAN BEING I DO MEAN TO SAY THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE IT WAS THE BEST THING FOR OLIVER TWIST THAT COULD BY POSSIBILITY HAVE OCCURRED THE FACT IS THAT THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN INDUCING OLIVER TO TAKE UPON HIMSELF THE OFFICE OF RESPIRATIONA TROUBLESOME PRACTICE BUT ONE WHICH CUSTOM HAS RENDERED NECESSARY TO OUR EASY EXISTENCE AND FOR SOME TIME HE LAY GASPING ON A LITTLE FLOCK MATTRESS RATHER UNEQUALLY POISED BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT THE BALANCE BEING DECIDEDLY IN FAVOUR OF THE LATTER NOW IF DURING THIS BRIEF PERIOD OLIVER HAD BEEN SURROUNDED BY CAREFUL GRANDMOTHERS ANXIOUS AUNTS EXPERIENCED NURSES AND DOCTORS OF PROFOUND WISDOM HE WOULD MOST INEVITABLY AND INDUBITABLY HAVE BEEN KILLED IN NO TIME THERE BEING NOBODY BY HOWEVER BUT A PAUPER OLD WOMAN WHO WAS RENDERED RATHER MISTY BY AN UNWONTED ALLOWANCE OF BEER AND A PARISH SURGEON WHO DID SUCH MATTERS BY CONTRACT OLIVER AND NATURE FOUGHT OUT THE POINT BETWEEN THEM THE RESULT WAS THAT AFTER A FEW STRUGGLES OLIVER BREATHED SNEEZED AND PROCEEDED TO ADVERTISE TO THE INMATES OF THE WORKHOUSE THE FACT OF A NEW BURDEN HAVING BEEN IMPOSED UPON THE PARISH BY SETTING UP AS LOUD A CRY AS COULD REASONABLY HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM A MALE INFANT WHO HAD NOT BEEN POSSESSED OF THAT VERY USEFUL APPENDAGE A VOICE FOR A MUCH LONGER SPACE OF TIME THAN THREE MINUTES AND A QUARTER AS OLIVER GAVE THIS FIRST PROOF OF THE FREE AND PROPER ACTION OF HIS LUNGS THE PATCHWORK COVERLET WHICH WAS CARELESSLY FLUNG OVER THE IRON BEDSTEAD RUSTLED THE PALE FACE OF A YOUNG WOMAN WAS RAISED FEEBLY FROM THE PILLOW AND A FAINT VOICE IMPERFECTLY ARTICULATED THE WORDS LET ME SEE THE CHILD AND DIE THE SURGEON HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS FACE TURNED TOWARDS THE FIRE GIVING THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS A WARM AND A RUB ALTERNATELY AS THE YOUNG WOMAN SPOKE HE ROSE AND ADVANCING TO THE BEDS HEAD SAID WITH MORE KINDNESS THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED OF HIM OH YOU MUST NOT TALK ABOUT DYING YET LOR BLESS HER DEAR HEART NO INTERPOSED THE NURSE HASTILY DEPOSITING IN HER POCKET A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE THE CONTENTS OF WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TASTING IN A CORNER WITH EVIDENT SATISFACTION LOR BLESS HER DEAR HEART WHEN SHE HAS LIVED AS LONG AS I HAVE SIR AND HAD THIRTEEN CHILDREN OF HER OWN AND ALL ON EM DEAD EXCEPT TWO AND THEM IN THE WURKUS WITH ME SHELL KNOW BETTER THAN TO TAKE ON IN THAT WAY BLESS HER DEAR HEART THINK WHAT IT IS TO BE A MOTHER THERES A DEAR YOUNG LAMB DO APPARENTLY THIS CONSOLATORY PERSPECTIVE OF A MOTHERS PROSPECTS FAILED IN PRODUCING ITS DUE EFFECT THE PATIENT SHOOK HER HEAD AND STRETCHED OUT HER HAND TOWARDS THE CHILD THE SURGEON DEPOSITED IT IN HER ARMS SHE IMPRINTED HER COLD WHITE LIPS PASSIONATELY ON ITS FOREHEAD PASSED HER HANDS OVER HER FACE GAZED WILDLY ROUND SHUDDERED FELL BACKAND DIED THEY CHAFED HER BREAST HANDS AND TEMPLES BUT THE BLOOD HAD STOPPED FOREVER THEY TALKED OF HOPE AND COMFORT THEY HAD BEEN STRANGERS TOO LONG ITS ALL OVER MRS THINGUMMY SAID THE SURGEON AT LAST AH POOR DEAR SO IT IS SAID THE NURSE PICKING UP THE CORK OF THE GREEN BOTTLE WHICH HAD FALLEN OUT ON THE PILLOW AS SHE STOOPED TO TAKE UP THE CHILD POOR DEAR YOU NEEDNT MIND SENDING UP TO ME IF THE CHILD CRIES NURSE SAID THE SURGEON PUTTING ON HIS GLOVES WITH GREAT DELIBERATION ITS VERY LIKELY IT WILL BE TROUBLESOME GIVE IT A LITTLE GRUEL IF IT IS HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND PAUSING BY THE BEDSIDE ON HIS WAY TO THE DOOR ADDED SHE WAS A GOODLOOKING GIRL TOO WHERE DID SHE COME FROM SHE WAS BROUGHT HERE LAST NIGHT REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN BY THE OVERSEERS ORDER SHE WAS FOUND LYING IN THE STREET SHE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE FOR HER SHOES WERE WORN TO PIECES BUT WHERE SHE CAME FROM OR WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO NOBODY KNOWS THE SURGEON LEANED OVER THE BODY AND RAISED THE LEFT HAND THE OLD STORY HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD NO WEDDINGRING I SEE AH GOODNIGHT THE MEDICAL GENTLEMAN WALKED AWAY TO DINNER AND THE NURSE HAVING ONCE MORE APPLIED HERSELF TO THE GREEN BOTTLE SAT DOWN ON A LOW CHAIR BEFORE THE FIRE AND PROCEEDED TO DRESS THE INFANT WHAT AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THE POWER OF DRESS YOUNG OLIVER TWIST WAS WRAPPED IN THE BLANKET WHICH HAD HITHERTO FORMED HIS ONLY COVERING HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CHILD OF A NOBLEMAN OR A BEGGAR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD FOR THE HAUGHTIEST STRANGER TO HAVE ASSIGNED HIM HIS PROPER STATION IN SOCIETY BUT NOW THAT HE WAS ENVELOPED IN THE OLD CALICO ROBES WHICH HAD GROWN YELLOW IN THE SAME SERVICE HE WAS BADGED AND TICKETED AND FELL INTO HIS PLACE AT ONCEA PARISH CHILDTHE ORPHAN OF A WORKHOUSETHE HUMBLE HALFSTARVED DRUDGETO BE CUFFED AND BUFFETED THROUGH THE WORLDDESPISED BY ALL AND PITIED BY NONE OLIVER CRIED LUSTILY IF HE COULD HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WAS AN ORPHAN LEFT TO THE TENDER MERCIES OF CHURCHWARDENS AND OVERSEERS PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE CRIED THE LOUDER CHAPTER II TREATS OF OLIVER TWISTS GROWTH EDUCATION AND BOARD FOR THE NEXT EIGHT OR TEN MONTHS OLIVER WAS THE VICTIM OF A SYSTEMATIC COURSE OF TREACHERY AND DECEPTION HE WAS BROUGHT UP BY HAND THE HUNGRY AND DESTITUTE SITUATION OF THE INFANT ORPHAN WAS DULY REPORTED BY THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES TO THE PARISH AUTHORITIES THE PARISH AUTHORITIES INQUIRED WITH DIGNITY OF THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES WHETHER THERE WAS NO FEMALE THEN DOMICILED IN THE HOUSE WHO WAS IN A SITUATION TO IMPART TO OLIVER TWIST THE CONSOLATION AND NOURISHMENT OF WHICH HE STOOD IN NEED THE WORKHOUSE AUTHORITIES REPLIED WITH HUMILITY THAT THERE WAS NOT UPON THIS THE PARISH AUTHORITIES MAGNANIMOUSLY AND HUMANELY RESOLVED THAT OLIVER SHOULD BE FARMED OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT HE SHOULD BE DISPATCHED TO A BRANCHWORKHOUSE SOME THREE MILES OFF WHERE TWENTY OR THIRTY OTHER JUVENILE OFFENDERS AGAINST THE POORLAWS ROLLED ABOUT THE FLOOR ALL DAY WITHOUT THE INCONVENIENCE OF TOO MUCH FOOD OR TOO MUCH CLOTHING UNDER THE PARENTAL SUPERINTENDENCE OF AN ELDERLY FEMALE WHO RECEIVED THE CULPRITS AT AND FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF SEVENPENCEHALFPENNY PER SMALL HEAD PER WEEK SEVENPENCEHALFPENNYS WORTH PER WEEK IS A GOOD ROUND DIET FOR A CHILD A GREAT DEAL MAY BE GOT FOR SEVENPENCEHALFPENNY QUITE ENOUGH TO OVERLOAD ITS STOMACH AND MAKE IT UNCOMFORTABLE THE ELDERLY FEMALE WAS A WOMAN OF WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND SHE HAD A VERY ACCURATE PERCEPTION OF WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HERSELF SO SHE APPROPRIATED THE GREATER PART OF THE WEEKLY STIPEND TO HER OWN USE AND CONSIGNED THE RISING PAROCHIAL GENERATION TO EVEN A SHORTER ALLOWANCE THAN WAS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED FOR THEM THEREBY FINDING IN THE LOWEST DEPTH A DEEPER STILL AND PROVING HERSELF A VERY GREAT EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHER EVERYBODY KNOWS THE STORY OF ANOTHER EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHER WHO HAD A GREAT THEORY ABOUT A HORSE BEING ABLE TO LIVE WITHOUT EATING AND WHO DEMONSTRATED IT SO WELL THAT HE HAD GOT HIS OWN HORSE DOWN TO A STRAW A DAY AND WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY HAVE RENDERED HIM A VERY SPIRITED AND RAMPACIOUS ANIMAL ON NOTHING AT ALL IF HE HAD NOT DIED FOURANDTWENTY HOURS BEFORE HE WAS TO HAVE HAD HIS FIRST COMFORTABLE BAIT OF AIR UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY OF THE FEMALE TO WHOSE PROTECTING CARE OLIVER TWIST WAS DELIVERED OVER A SIMILAR RESULT USUALLY ATTENDED THE OPERATION OF HER SYSTEM FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE CHILD HAD CONTRIVED TO EXIST UPON THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE PORTION OF THE WEAKEST POSSIBLE FOOD IT DID PERVERSELY HAPPEN IN EIGHT AND A HALF CASES OUT OF TEN EITHER THAT IT SICKENED FROM WANT AND COLD OR FELL INTO THE FIRE FROM NEGLECT OR GOT HALFSMOTHERED BY ACCIDENT IN ANY ONE OF WHICH CASES THE MISERABLE LITTLE BEING WAS USUALLY SUMMONED INTO ANOTHER WORLD AND THERE GATHERED TO THE FATHERS IT HAD NEVER KNOWN IN THIS OCCASIONALLY WHEN THERE WAS SOME MORE THAN USUALLY INTERESTING INQUEST UPON A PARISH CHILD WHO HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED IN TURNING UP A BEDSTEAD OR INADVERTENTLY SCALDED TO DEATH WHEN THERE HAPPENED TO BE A WASHINGTHOUGH THE LATTER ACCIDENT WAS VERY SCARCE ANYTHING APPROACHING TO A WASHING BEING OF RARE OCCURRENCE IN THE FARMTHE JURY WOULD TAKE IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO ASK TROUBLESOME QUESTIONS OR THE PARISHIONERS WOULD REBELLIOUSLY AFFIX THEIR SIGNATURES TO A REMONSTRANCE BUT THESE IMPERTINENCES WERE SPEEDILY CHECKED BY THE EVIDENCE OF THE SURGEON AND THE TESTIMONY OF THE BEADLE THE FORMER OF WHOM HAD ALWAYS OPENED THE BODY AND FOUND NOTHING INSIDE WHICH WAS VERY PROBABLE INDEED AND THE LATTER OF WHOM INVARIABLY SWORE WHATEVER THE PARISH WANTED WHICH WAS VERY SELFDEVOTIONAL BESIDES THE BOARD MADE PERIODICAL PILGRIMAGES TO THE FARM AND ALWAYS SENT THE BEADLE THE DAY BEFORE TO SAY THEY WERE GOING THE CHILDREN WERE NEAT AND CLEAN TO BEHOLD WHEN THEY WENT AND WHAT MORE WOULD THE PEOPLE HAVE IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT THIS SYSTEM OF FARMING WOULD PRODUCE ANY VERY EXTRAORDINARY OR LUXURIANT CROP OLIVER TWISTS NINTH BIRTHDAY FOUND HIM A PALE THIN CHILD SOMEWHAT DIMINUTIVE IN STATURE AND DECIDEDLY SMALL IN CIRCUMFERENCE BUT NATURE OR INHERITANCE HAD IMPLANTED A GOOD STURDY SPIRIT IN OLIVERS BREAST IT HAD HAD PLENTY OF ROOM TO EXPAND THANKS TO THE SPARE DIET OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AND PERHAPS TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE MAY BE ATTRIBUTED HIS HAVING ANY NINTH BIRTHDAY AT ALL BE THIS AS IT MAY HOWEVER IT WAS HIS NINTH BIRTHDAY AND HE WAS KEEPING IT IN THE COALCELLAR WITH A SELECT PARTY OF TWO OTHER YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO AFTER PARTICIPATING WITH HIM IN A SOUND THRASHING HAD BEEN LOCKED UP FOR ATROCIOUSLY PRESUMING TO BE HUNGRY WHEN

SENSE ENOUGH TO MAKE A FEINT OF FEELING GREAT REGRET AT GOING AWAY IT WAS NO VERY DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THE BOY TO CALL TEARS INTO HIS EYES HUNGER AND RECENT ILLUSAGE ARE GREAT ASSISTANTS IF YOU WANT TO CRY AND OLIVER CRIED VERY NATURALLY INDEED MRS MANN GAVE HIM A THOUSAND EMBRACES AND WHAT OLIVER WANTED A GREAT DEAL MORE A PIECE OF BREAD AND BUTTER LESS HE SHOULD SEEM TOO HUNGRY WHEN HE GOT TO THE WORKHOUSE WITH THE SLICE OF BREAD IN HIS HAND AND THE LITTLE BROWNCLOTH PARISH CAP ON HIS HEAD OLIVER WAS THEN LED AWAY BY MR BUMBLE FROM THE WRETCHED HOME WHERE ONE KIND WORD OR LOOK HAD NEVER LIGHTED THE GLOOM OF HIS INFANT YEARS AND YET HE BURST INTO AN AGONY OF CHILDISH GRIEF AS THE COTTAGEGATE CLOSED AFTER HIM WRETCHED AS WERE THE LITTLE COMPANIONS IN MISERY HE WAS LEAVING BEHIND THEY WERE THE ONLY FRIENDS HE HAD EVER KNOWN AND A SENSE OF HIS LONELINESS IN THE GREAT WIDE WORLD SANK INTO THE CHILDS HEART FOR THE FIRST TIME MR BUMBLE WALKED ON WITH LONG STRIDES LITTLE OLIVER FIRMLY GRASPING HIS GOLDLACED CUFF TROTTED BESIDE HIM INQUIRING AT THE END OF EVERY QUARTER OF A MILE WHETHER THEY WERE NEARLY THERE TO THESE INTERROGATIONS MR BUMBLE RETURNED VERY BRIEF AND SNAPPISH REPLIES FOR THE TEMPORARY BLANDNESS WHICH GINANDWATER AWAKENS IN SOME BOSOMS HAD BY THIS TIME EVAPORATED AND HE WAS ONCE AGAIN A BEADLE OLIVER HAD NOT BEEN WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE WORKHOUSE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND HAD SCARCELY COMPLETED THE DEMOLITION OF A SECOND SLICE OF BREAD WHEN MR BUMBLE WHO HAD HANDED HIM OVER TO THE CARE OF AN OLD WOMAN RETURNED AND TELLING HIM IT WAS A BOARD NIGHT INFORMED HIM THAT THE BOARD HAD SAID HE WAS TO APPEAR BEFORE IT FORTHWITH NOT HAVING A VERY CLEARLY DEFINED NOTION OF WHAT A LIVE BOARD WAS OLIVER WAS RATHER ASTOUNDED BY THIS INTELLIGENCE AND WAS NOT QUITE CERTAIN WHETHER HE OUGHT TO LAUGH OR CRY HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE MATTER HOWEVER FOR MR BUMBLE GAVE HIM A TAP ON THE HEAD WITH HIS CANE TO WAKE HIM UP AND ANOTHER ON THE BACK TO MAKE HIM LIVELY AND BIDDING HIM TO FOLLOW CONDUCTED HIM INTO A LARGE WHITEWASHED ROOM WHERE EIGHT OR TEN FAT GENTLEMEN WERE SITTING ROUND A TABLE AT THE TOP OF THE TABLE SEATED IN AN ARMCHAIR RATHER HIGHER THAN THE REST WAS A PARTICULARLY FAT GENTLEMAN WITH A VERY ROUND RED FACE BOW TO THE BOARD SAID BUMBLE OLIVER BRUSHED AWAY TWO OR THREE TEARS THAT WERE LINGERING IN HIS EYES AND SEEING NO BOARD BUT THE TABLE FORTUNATELY BOWED TO THAT WHATS YOUR NAME BOY SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE HIGH CHAIR OLIVER WAS FRIGHTENED AT THE SIGHT OF SO MANY GENTLEMEN WHICH MADE HIM TREMBLE AND THE BEADLE GAVE HIM ANOTHER TAP BEHIND WHICH MADE HIM CRY THESE TWO CAUSES MADE HIM ANSWER IN A VERY LOW AND HESITATING VOICE WHEREUPON A GENTLEMAN IN A WHITE WAISTCOAT SAID HE WAS A FOOL WHICH WAS A CAPITAL WAY OF RAISING HIS SPIRITS AND PUTTING HIM QUITE AT HIS EASE BOY SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE HIGH CHAIR LISTEN TO ME YOU KNOW YOURE AN ORPHAN I SUPPOSE WHATS THAT SIR INQUIRED POOR OLIVER THE BOY IS A FOOLI THOUGHT HE WAS SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT HUSH SAID THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD SPOKEN FIRST YOU KNOW YOUVE GOT NO FATHER OR MOTHER AND THAT YOU WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE PARISH DONT YOU YES SIR REPLIED OLIVER WEEPING BITTERLY WHAT ARE YOU CRYING FOR INQUIRED THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT AND TO BE SURE IT WAS VERY EXTRAORDINARY WHAT COULD THE BOY BE CRYING FOR I HOPE YOU SAY YOUR PRAYERS EVERY NIGHT SAID ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN A GRUFF VOICE AND PRAY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO FEED YOU AND TAKE CARE OF YOULIKE A CHRISTIAN YES SIR STAMMERED THE BOY THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE LAST WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY RIGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY LIKE A CHRISTIAN AND A MARVELLOUSLY GOOD CHRISTIAN TOO IF OLIVER HAD PRAYED FOR THE PEOPLE WHO FED AND TOOK CARE OF HIM BUT HE HADNT BECAUSE NOBODY HAD TAUGHT HIM WELL YOU HAVE COME HERE TO BE EDUCATED AND TAUGHT A USEFUL TRADE SAID THE REDFACED GENTLEMAN IN THE HIGH CHAIR SO YOULL BEGIN TO PICK OAKUM TOMORROW MORNING AT SIX OCLOCK ADDED THE SURLY ONE IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT FOR THE COMBINATION OF BOTH THESE BLESSINGS IN THE ONE SIMPLE PROCESS OF PICKING OAKUM OLIVER BOWED LOW BY THE DIRECTION OF THE BEADLE AND WAS THEN HURRIED AWAY TO A LARGE WARD WHERE ON A ROUGH HARD BED HE SOBBED HIMSELF TO SLEEP WHAT A NOVEL ILLUSTRATION OF THE TENDER LAWS OF ENGLAND THEY LET THE PAUPERS GO TO SLEEP POOR OLIVER HE LITTLE THOUGHT AS HE LAY SLEEPING IN HAPPY UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL AROUND HIM THAT THE BOARD HAD THAT VERY DAY ARRIVED AT A DECISION WHICH WOULD EXERCISE THE MOST MATERIAL INFLUENCE OVER ALL HIS FUTURE FORTUNES BUT THEY HAD AND THIS WAS IT THE MEMBERS OF THIS BOARD WERE VERY SAGE DEEP PHILOSOPHICAL MEN AND WHEN THEY CAME TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO THE WORKHOUSE THEY FOUND OUT AT ONCE WHAT ORDINARY FOLKS WOULD NEVER HAVE DISCOVEREDTHE POOR PEOPLE LIKED IT IT WAS A REGULAR PLACE OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE POORER CLASSES A TAVERN WHERE THERE WAS NOTHING TO PAY A PUBLIC BREAKFAST DINNER TEA AND SUPPER ALL THE YEAR ROUND A BRICK AND MORTAR ELYSIUM WHERE IT WAS ALL PLAY AND NO WORK OHO SAID THE BOARD LOOKING VERY KNOWING WE ARE THE FELLOWS TO SET THIS TO RIGHTS WELL STOP IT ALL IN NO TIME SO THEY ESTABLISHED THE RULE THAT ALL POOR PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE ALTERNATIVE FOR THEY WOULD COMPEL NOBODY NOT THEY OF BEING STARVED BY A GRADUAL PROCESS IN THE HOUSE OR BY A QUICK ONE OUT OF IT WITH THIS VIEW THEY CONTRACTED WITH THE WATERWORKS TO LAY ON AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER AND WITH A CORNFACTOR TO SUPPLY PERIODICALLY SMALL QUANTITIES OF OATMEAL AND ISSUED THREE MEALS OF THIN GRUEL A DAY WITH AN ONION TWICE A WEEK AND HALF A ROLL OF SUNDAYS THEY MADE A GREAT MANY OTHER WISE AND HUMANE REGULATIONS HAVING REFERENCE TO THE LADIES WHICH IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO REPEAT KINDLY UNDERTOOK TO DIVORCE POOR MARRIED PEOPLE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE GREAT EXPENSE OF A SUIT IN DOCTORS COMMONS AND INSTEAD OF COMPELLING A MAN TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY AS THEY HAD THERETOFORE DONE TOOK HIS FAMILY AWAY FROM HIM AND MADE HIM A BACHELOR THERE IS NO SAYING HOW MANY APPLICANTS FOR RELIEF UNDER THESE LAST TWO HEADS MIGHT HAVE STARTED UP IN ALL CLASSES OF SOCIETY IF IT HAD NOT BEEN COUPLED WITH THE WORKHOUSE BUT THE BOARD WERE LONGHEADED MEN AND HAD PROVIDED FOR THIS DIFFICULTY THE RELIEF WAS INSEPARABLE FROM THE WORKHOUSE AND THE GRUEL AND THAT FRIGHTENED PEOPLE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS AFTER OLIVER TWIST WAS REMOVED THE SYSTEM WAS IN FULL OPERATION IT WAS RATHER EXPENSIVE AT FIRST IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INCREASE IN THE UNDERTAKERS BILL AND THE NECESSITY OF TAKING IN THE CLOTHES OF ALL THE PAUPERS WHICH FLUTTERED LOOSELY ON THEIR WASTED SHRUNKEN FORMS AFTER A WEEK OR TWOS GRUEL BUT THE NUMBER OF WORKHOUSE INMATES GOT THIN AS WELL AS THE PAUPERS AND THE BOARD WERE IN ECSTASIES THE ROOM IN WHICH THE BOYS WERE FED WAS A LARGE STONE HALL WITH A COPPER AT ONE END OUT OF WHICH THE MASTER DRESSED IN AN APRON FOR THE PURPOSE AND ASSISTED BY ONE OR TWO WOMEN LADLED THE GRUEL AT MEALTIMES OF THIS FESTIVE COMPOSITION EACH BOY HAD ONE PORRINGER AND NO MOREEXCEPT ON OCCASIONS OF GREAT PUBLIC REJOICING WHEN HE HAD TWO OUNCES AND A QUARTER OF BREAD BESIDES THE BOWLS NEVER WANTED WASHING THE BOYS POLISHED THEM WITH THEIR SPOONS TILL THEY SHONE AGAIN AND WHEN THEY HAD PERFORMED THIS OPERATION WHICH NEVER TOOK VERY LONG THE SPOONS BEING NEARLY AS LARGE AS THE BOWLS THEY WOULD SIT STARING AT THE COPPER WITH SUCH EAGER EYES AS IF THEY COULD HAVE DEVOURED THE VERY BRICKS OF WHICH IT WAS COMPOSED EMPLOYING THEMSELVES MEANWHILE IN SUCKING THEIR FINGERS MOST ASSIDUOUSLY WITH THE VIEW OF CATCHING UP ANY STRAY SPLASHES OF GRUEL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CAST THEREON BOYS HAVE GENERALLY EXCELLENT APPETITES OLIVER TWIST AND HIS COMPANIONS SUFFERED THE TORTURES OF SLOW STARVATION FOR THREE MONTHS AT LAST THEY GOT SO VORACIOUS AND WILD WITH HUNGER THAT ONE BOY WHO WAS TALL FOR HIS AGE AND HADNT BEEN USED TO THAT SORT OF THING FOR HIS FATHER HAD KEPT A SMALL COOKSHOP HINTED DARKLY TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT UNLESS HE HAD ANOTHER BASIN OF GRUEL PER DIEM HE WAS AFRAID HE MIGHT SOME NIGHT HAPPEN TO EAT THE BOY WHO SLEPT NEXT HIM WHO HAPPENED TO BE A WEAKLY YOUTH OF TENDER AGE HE HAD A WILD HUNGRY EYE AND THEY IMPLICITLY BELIEVED HIM A COUNCIL WAS HELD LOTS WERE CAST WHO SHOULD WALK UP TO THE MASTER AFTER SUPPER THAT EVENING AND ASK FOR MORE AND IT FELL TO OLIVER TWIST THE EVENING ARRIVED THE BOYS TOOK THEIR PLACES THE MASTER IN HIS COOKS UNIFORM STATIONED HIMSELF AT THE COPPER HIS PAUPER ASSISTANTS RANGED THEMSELVES BEHIND HIM THE GRUEL WAS SERVED OUT AND A LONG GRACE WAS SAID OVER THE SHORT COMMONS THE GRUEL DISAPPEARED THE BOYS WHISPERED EACH OTHER AND WINKED AT OLIVER WHILE HIS NEXT NEIGHBORS NUDGED HIM CHILD AS HE WAS HE WAS DESPERATE WITH HUNGER AND RECKLESS WITH MISERY HE ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND ADVANCING TO THE MASTER BASIN AND SPOON IN HAND SAID SOMEWHAT ALARMED AT HIS OWN TEMERITY PLEASE SIR I WANT SOME MORE THE MASTER WAS A FAT HEALTHY MAN BUT HE TURNED VERY PALE HE GAZED IN STUPEFIED ASTONISHMENT ON THE SMALL REBEL FOR SOME SECONDS AND THEN CLUNG FOR SUPPORT TO THE COPPER THE ASSISTANTS WERE PARALYSED WITH WONDER THE BOYS WITH FEAR WHAT SAID THE MASTER AT LENGTH IN A FAINT VOICE PLEASE SIR REPLIED OLIVER I WANT SOME MORE THE MASTER AIMED A BLOW AT OLIVERS HEAD WITH THE LADLE PINIONED HIM IN HIS ARM AND SHRIEKED ALOUD FOR THE BEADLE THE BOARD WERE SITTING IN SOLEMN CONCLAVE WHEN MR BUMBLE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM IN GREAT EXCITEMENT AND ADDRESSING THE GENTLEMAN IN THE HIGH CHAIR SAID MR LIMBKINS I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR OLIVER TWIST HAS ASKED FOR MORE THERE WAS A GENERAL START HORROR WAS DEPICTED ON EVERY COUNTENANCE FOR MORE SAID MR LIMBKINS COMPOSE YOURSELF BUMBLE AND ANSWER ME DISTINCTLY DO I UNDERSTAND THAT HE ASKED FOR MORE AFTER HE HAD EATEN THE SUPPER ALLOTTED BY THE DIETARY HE DID SIR REPLIED BUMBLE THAT BOY WILL BE HUNG SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT I KNOW THAT BOY WILL BE HUNG NOBODY CONTROVERTED THE PROPHETIC GENTLEMANS OPINION AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION TOOK PLACE OLIVER WAS ORDERED INTO INSTANT CONFINEMENT AND A BILL WAS NEXT MORNING PASTED ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE GATE OFFERING A REWARD OF FIVE POUNDS TO ANYBODY WHO WOULD TAKE OLIVER TWIST OFF THE HANDS OF THE PARISH IN OTHER WORDS FIVE POUNDS AND OLIVER TWIST WERE OFFERED TO ANY MAN OR WOMAN WHO WANTED AN APPRENTICE TO ANY TRADE BUSINESS OR CALLING I NEVER WAS MORE CONVINCED OF ANYTHING IN MY LIFE SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT AS HE KNOCKED AT THE GATE AND READ THE BILL NEXT MORNING I NEVER WAS MORE CONVINCED OF ANYTHING IN MY LIFE THAN I AM THAT THAT BOY WILL COME TO BE HUNG AS I PURPOSE TO SHOW IN THE SEQUEL WHETHER THE WHITE WAISTCOATED GENTLEMAN WAS RIGHT OR NOT I SHOULD PERHAPS MAR THE INTEREST OF THIS NARRATIVE SUPPOSING IT TO POSSESS ANY AT ALL IF I VENTURED TO HINT JUST YET WHETHER THE LIFE OF OLIVER TWIST HAD THIS VIOLENT TERMINATION OR NO CHAPTER III RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE FOR A WEEK AFTER THE COMMISSION OF THE IMPIOUS AND PROFANE OFFENCE OF ASKING FOR MORE OLIVER REMAINED A CLOSE PRISONER IN THE DARK AND SOLITARY ROOM TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONSIGNED BY THE WISDOM AND MERCY OF THE BOARD IT APPEARS AT FIRST SIGHT NOT UNREASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT IF HE HAD ENTERTAINED A BECOMING FEELING OF RESPECT FOR THE PREDICTION OF THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT HE WOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT SAGE INDIVIDUALS PROPHETIC CHARACTER ONCE AND FOR EVER BY TYING ONE END OF HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF TO A HOOK IN THE WALL AND ATTACHING HIMSELF TO THE OTHER TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS FEAT HOWEVER THERE WAS ONE OBSTACLE NAMELY THAT POCKETHANDKERCHIEFS BEING DECIDED ARTICLES OF LUXURY HAD BEEN FOR ALL FUTURE TIMES AND AGES REMOVED FROM THE NOSES OF PAUPERS BY THE EXPRESS ORDER OF THE BOARD IN COUNCIL ASSEMBLED SOLEMNLY GIVEN AND PRONOUNCED UNDER THEIR HANDS AND SEALS THERE WAS A STILL GREATER OBSTACLE IN OLIVERS YOUTH AND CHILDISHNESS HE ONLY CRIED BITTERLY ALL DAY AND WHEN THE LONG DISMAL NIGHT CAME ON SPREAD HIS LITTLE HANDS BEFORE HIS EYES TO SHUT OUT THE DARKNESS AND CROUCHING IN THE CORNER TRIED TO SLEEP EVER AND ANON WAKING WITH A START AND TREMBLE AND DRAWING HIMSELF CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE WALL AS IF TO FEEL EVEN ITS COLD HARD SURFACE WERE A PROTECTION IN THE GLOOM AND LONELINESS WHICH SURROUNDED HIM LET IT NOT BE SUPPOSED BY THE ENEMIES OF THE SYSTEM THAT DURING THE PERIOD OF HIS SOLITARY INCARCERATION OLIVER WAS DENIED THE BENEFIT OF EXERCISE THE PLEASURE OF SOCIETY OR THE ADVANTAGES OF RELIGIOUS CONSOLATION AS FOR EXERCISE IT WAS NICE COLD WEATHER AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO PERFORM HIS ABLUTIONS EVERY MORNING UNDER THE PUMP IN A STONE YARD IN THE PRESENCE OF MR BUMBLE WHO PREVENTED HIS CATCHING COLD AND CAUSED A TINGLING SENSATION TO PERVADE HIS FRAME BY REPEATED APPLICATIONS OF THE CANE AS FOR SOCIETY HE WAS CARRIED EVERY OTHER DAY INTO THE HALL WHERE THE BOYS DINED AND THERE SOCIABLY FLOGGED AS A PUBLIC WARNING AND EXAMPLE AND SO FAR FROM BEING DENIED THE ADVANTAGES OF RELIGIOUS CONSOLATION HE WAS KICKED INTO THE SAME APARTMENT EVERY EVENING AT PRAYERTIME AND THERE PERMITTED TO LISTEN TO AND CONSOLE HIS MIND WITH A GENERAL SUPPLICATION OF THE BOYS CONTAINING A SPECIAL CLAUSE THEREIN INSERTED BY AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD IN WHICH THEY ENTREATED TO BE MADE GOOD VIRTUOUS CONTENTED AND OBEDIENT AND TO BE GUARDED FROM THE SINS AND VICES OF OLIVER TWIST WHOM THE SUPPLICATION DISTINCTLY SET FORTH TO BE UNDER THE EXCLUSIVE PATRONAGE AND PROTECTION OF THE POWERS OF WICKEDNESS AND AN ARTICLE DIRECT FROM THE MANUFACTORY OF THE VERY DEVIL HIMSELF IT CHANCED ONE MORNING WHILE OLIVERS AFFAIRS WERE IN THIS AUSPICIOUS AND COMFORTABLE STATE THAT MR GAMFIELD CHIMNEYSWEEP WENT HIS WAY DOWN THE HIGH STREET DEEPLY COGITATING IN HIS MIND HIS WAYS AND MEANS OF PAYING CERTAIN ARREARS OF RENT FOR WHICH HIS LANDLORD HAD BECOME RATHER PRESSING MR GAMFIELDS MOST SANGUINE ESTIMATE OF HIS FINANCES COULD NOT RAISE THEM WITHIN FULL FIVE POUNDS OF THE DESIRED AMOUNT AND IN A SPECIES OF ARITHMETICAL DESPERATION HE WAS ALTERNATELY CUDGELLING HIS BRAINS AND HIS DONKEY WHEN PASSING THE WORKHOUSE HIS EYES ENCOUNTERED THE BILL ON THE GATE WOO SAID MR GAMFIELD TO THE DONKEY THE DONKEY WAS IN A STATE OF PROFOUND ABSTRACTION WONDERING PROBABLY WHETHER HE WAS DESTINED TO BE REGALED WITH A CABBAGESTALK OR TWO WHEN HE HAD DISPOSED OF THE TWO SACKS OF SOOT WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CART WAS LADEN SO WITHOUT NOTICING THE WORD OF COMMAND HE JOGGED ONWARD MR GAMFIELD GROWLED A FIERCE IMPRECATION ON THE DONKEY GENERALLY BUT MORE PARTICULARLY ON HIS EYES AND RUNNING AFTER HIM BESTOWED A BLOW ON HIS HEAD WHICH WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE BEATEN IN ANY SKULL BUT A DONKEYS THEN CATCHING HOLD OF THE BRIDLE HE GAVE HIS JAW A SHARP WRENCH BY WAY OF GENTLE REMINDER THAT HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER AND BY THESE MEANS TURNED HIM ROUND HE THEN GAVE HIM ANOTHER BLOW ON THE HEAD JUST TO STUN HIM TILL HE CAME BACK AGAIN HAVING COMPLETED THESE ARRANGEMENTS HE WALKED UP TO THE GATE TO READ THE BILL THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE WHITE WAISTCOAT WAS STANDING AT THE GATE WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AFTER HAVING DELIVERED HIMSELF OF SOME PROFOUND SENTIMENTS IN THE BOARDROOM HAVING WITNESSED THE LITTLE DISPUTE BETWEEN MR GAMFIELD AND THE DONKEY HE SMILED JOYOUSLY WHEN THAT PERSON CAME UP TO READ THE BILL FOR HE SAW AT ONCE THAT MR GAMFIELD WAS EXACTLY THE SORT OF MASTER OLIVER TWIST WANTED MR GAMFIELD SMILED TOO AS HE PERUSED THE DOCUMENT FOR FIVE POUNDS WAS JUST THE SUM HE HAD BEEN WISHING FOR AND AS TO THE BOY WITH WHICH IT WAS ENCUMBERED MR GAMFIELD KNOWING WHAT THE DIETARY OF THE WORKHOUSE WAS WELL KNEW HE WOULD BE A NICE SMALL PATTERN JUST THE VERY THING FOR REGISTER STOVES SO HE SPELT THE BILL THROUGH AGAIN FROM BEGINNING TO END AND THEN TOUCHING HIS FUR CAP IN TOKEN OF HUMILITY ACCOSTED THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT THIS HERE BOY SIR WOT THE PARISH WANTS TO PRENTIS SAID MR GAMFIELD AY MY MAN SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT WITH A CONDESCENDING SMILE WHAT OF HIM IF THE PARISH VOULD LIKE HIM TO LEARN A RIGHT PLEASANT TRADE IN A GOOD SPECTABLE CHIMBLEYSWEEPIN BISNESS SAID MR GAMFIELD I WANTS A PRENTIS AND I AM READY TO TAKE HIM WALK IN SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT MR GAMFIELD HAVING LINGERED BEHIND TO GIVE THE DONKEY ANOTHER BLOW ON THE HEAD AND ANOTHER WRENCH OF THE JAW AS A CAUTION NOT TO RUN AWAY IN HIS ABSENCE FOLLOWED THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE WHITE WAISTCOAT INTO THE ROOM WHERE OLIVER HAD FIRST SEEN HIM ITS A NASTY TRADE SAID MR LIMBKINS WHEN GAMFIELD HAD AGAIN STATED HIS WISH YOUNG BOYS HAVE BEEN SMOTHERED IN CHIMNEYS BEFORE NOW SAID ANOTHER GENTLEMAN THATS ACAUSE THEY DAMPED THE STRAW AFORE THEY LIT IT IN THE CHIMBLEY TO MAKE EM COME DOWN AGAIN SAID GAMFIELD THATS ALL SMOKE AND NO BLAZE VEREAS SMOKE AINT O NO USE AT ALL IN MAKING A BOY COME DOWN FOR IT ONLY SINDS HIM TO SLEEP AND THATS WOT HE LIKES BOYS IS WERY OBSTINIT AND WERY LAZY GENLMEN AND THERES NOTHINK LIKE A GOOD HOT BLAZE TO MAKE EM COME DOWN VITH A RUN ITS HUMANE TOO GENLMEN ACAUSE EVEN IF THEYVE STUCK IN THE CHIMBLEY ROASTING THEIR FEET MAKES EM STRUGGLE TO HEXTRICATE THEIRSELVES THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT APPEARED VERY MUCH AMUSED BY THIS EXPLANATION BUT HIS MIRTH WAS SPEEDILY CHECKED BY A LOOK FROM MR LIMBKINS THE BOARD THEN PROCEEDED TO CONVERSE AMONG THEMSELVES FOR A FEW MINUTES BUT IN SO LOW A TONE THAT THE WORDS SAVING OF EXPENDITURE LOOKED WELL IN THE ACCOUNTS HAVE A PRINTED REPORT PUBLISHED WERE ALONE AUDIBLE THESE ONLY CHANCED TO BE HEARD INDEED OR ACCOUNT OF THEIR BEING VERY FREQUENTLY REPEATED WITH GREAT EMPHASIS AT LENGTH THE WHISPERING CEASED AND THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD HAVING RESUMED THEIR SEATS AND THEIR SOLEMNITY MR LIMBKINS SAID WE HAVE CONSIDERED YOUR PROPOSITION AND WE DONT APPROVE OF IT NOT AT ALL SAID THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT DECIDEDLY NOT ADDED THE OTHER MEMBERS AS MR GAMFIELD DID HAPPEN TO LABOUR UNDER THE SLIGHT IMPUTATION OF HAVING BRUISED THREE OR FOUR BOYS TO DEATH ALREADY IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE BOARD HAD PERHAPS IN SOME UNACCOUNTABLE FREAK TAKEN IT INTO THEIR HEADS THAT THIS EXTRANEOUS CIRCUMSTANCE OUGHT TO INFLUENCE THEIR PROCEEDINGS IT WAS VERY UNLIKE THEIR GENERAL MODE OF DOING BUSINESS IF THEY HAD BUT STILL AS HE HAD NO PARTICULAR WISH TO REVIVE THE RUMOUR HE TWISTED HIS CAP IN HIS HANDS AND WALKED SLOWLY FROM THE TABLE SO YOU WONT LET ME HAVE HIM GENLMEN SAID MR GAMFIELD PAUSING NEAR THE DOOR NO REPLIED MR LIMBKINS AT LEAST AS ITS A NASTY BUSINESS WE THINK YOU OUGHT TO TAKE SOMETHING LESS THAN THE PREMIUM WE OFFERED MR GAMFIELDS COUNTENANCE BRIGHTENED AS WITH A QUICK STEP HE RETURNED TO THE TABLE AND SAID WHATLL YOU GIVE GENLMEN COME DONT BE TOO HARD ON A POOR MAN WHATLL YOU GIVE I SHOULD SAY THREE POUND TEN WAS

OBSERVING A SMILE ON ALL OF THEM GRADUALLY BROKE INTO A SMILE HIMSELF THE BARGAIN WAS MADE MR BUMBLE WAS AT ONCE INSTRUCTED THAT OLIVER TWIST AND HIS INDENTURES WERE TO BE CONVEYED BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE FOR SIGNATURE AND APPROVAL THAT VERY AFTERNOON IN PURSUANCE OF THIS DETERMINATION LITTLE OLIVER TO HIS EXCESSIVE ASTONISHMENT WAS RELEASED FROM BONDAGE AND ORDERED TO PUT HIMSELF INTO A CLEAN SHIRT HE HAD HARDLY ACHIEVED THIS VERY UNUSUAL GYMNASTIC PERFORMANCE WHEN MR BUMBLE BROUGHT HIM WITH HIS OWN HANDS A BASIN OF GRUEL AND THE HOLIDAY ALLOWANCE OF TWO OUNCES AND A QUARTER OF BREAD AT THIS TREMENDOUS SIGHT OLIVER BEGAN TO CRY VERY PITEOUSLY THINKING NOT UNNATURALLY THAT THE BOARD MUST HAVE DETERMINED TO KILL HIM FOR SOME USEFUL PURPOSE OR THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE BEGUN TO FATTEN HIM UP IN THAT WAY DONT MAKE YOUR EYES RED OLIVER BUT EAT YOUR FOOD AND BE THANKFUL SAID MR BUMBLE IN A TONE OF IMPRESSIVE POMPOSITY YOURE A GOING TO BE MADE A PRENTICE OF OLIVER A PRENTICE SIR SAID

MR BUMBLE PAUSED TO TAKE BREATH AFTER DELIVERING THIS ADDRESS IN AN AWFUL VOICE THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN THE POOR CHILDS FACE AND HE SOBBED BITTERLY COME SAID MR BUMBLE SOMEWHAT LESS POMPOUSLY FOR IT WAS GRATIFYING TO HIS FEELINGS TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT HIS ELOQUENCE HAD PRODUCED COME OLIVER WIPE YOUR EYES WITH THE CUFFS OF YOUR JACKET AND DONT CRY INTO YOUR GRUEL THATS A VERY FOOLISH ACTION OLIVER IT CERTAINLY WAS FOR THERE WAS QUITE ENOUGH WATER IN IT ALREADY ON THEIR WAY TO THE MAGISTRATE MR BUMBLE INSTRUCTED OLIVER THAT ALL HE WOULD HAVE TO DO WOULD BE TO LOOK VERY HAPPY AND SAY WHEN THE GENTLEMAN ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED TO BE APPRENTICED THAT HE SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH INDEED BOTH OF WHICH INJUNCTIONS OLIVER PROMISED TO OBEY THE RATHER AS MR BUMBLE THREW IN A GENTLE HINT THAT IF HE FAILED IN EITHER PARTICULAR THERE WAS NO TELLING WHAT WOULD BE DONE TO HIM WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE OFFICE HE WAS SHUT UP IN A LITTLE ROOM BY HIMSELF AND ADMONISHED BY MR BUMBLE TO STAY THERE UNTIL HE CAME BACK TO FETCH HIM THERE THE BOY REMAINED WITH A PALPITATING HEART FOR HALF AN HOUR AT THE EXPIRATION OF WHICH TIME MR BUMBLE THRUST IN HIS HEAD UNADORNED WITH THE COCKED HAT AND SAID ALOUD NOW OLIVER MY DEAR COME TO THE GENTLEMAN AS MR BUMBLE SAID THIS HE PUT ON A GRIM AND THREATENING LOOK AND ADDED IN A LOW VOICE MIND WHAT I TOLD YOU YOU YOUNG RASCAL OLIVER STARED INNOCENTLY IN MR BUMBLES FACE AT THIS SOMEWHAT CONTRADICTORY STYLE OF ADDRESS BUT THAT GENTLEMAN PREVENTED HIS OFFERING ANY REMARK THEREUPON BY LEADING HIM AT ONCE INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM THE DOOR OF WHICH WAS OPEN IT WAS A LARGE ROOM WITH A GREAT WINDOW BEHIND A DESK SAT TWO OLD GENTLEMAN WITH POWDERED HEADS ONE OF WHOM WAS READING THE NEWSPAPER WHILE THE OTHER WAS PERUSING WITH THE AID OF A PAIR OF TORTOISESHELL SPECTACLES A SMALL PIECE OF PARCHMENT WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM MR LIMBKINS WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF THE DESK ON ONE SIDE AND MR GAMFIELD WITH A PARTIALLY WASHED FACE ON THE OTHER WHILE TWO OR THREE BLUFFLOOKING MEN IN TOPBOOTS WERE LOUNGING ABOUT THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE SPECTACLES GRADUALLY DOZED OFF OVER THE LITTLE BIT OF PARCHMENT AND THERE WAS A SHORT PAUSE AFTER OLIVER HAD BEEN STATIONED BY MR BUMBLE IN FRONT OF THE DESK THIS IS THE BOY YOUR WORSHIP SAID MR BUMBLE THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO WAS READING THE NEWSPAPER RAISED HIS HEAD FOR A MOMENT AND PULLED THE OTHER OLD GENTLEMAN BY THE SLEEVE WHEREUPON THE LASTMENTIONED OLD GENTLEMAN WOKE UP OH IS THIS THE BOY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THIS IS HIM SIR REPLIED MR BUMBLE BOW TO THE MAGISTRATE MY DEAR OLIVER ROUSED HIMSELF AND MADE HIS

HONEST OPENHEARTED MAN SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN TURNING HIS SPECTACLES IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CANDIDATE FOR OLIVERS PREMIUM WHOSE VILLAINOUS COUNTENANCE WAS A REGULAR STAMPED RECEIPT FOR CRUELTY BUT THE MAGISTRATE WAS HALF BLIND AND HALF CHILDISH SO HE COULDNT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO DISCERN WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DID I HOPE I AM SIR SAID MR GAMFIELD WITH AN UGLY LEER I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU ARE MY FRIEND REPLIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN FIXING HIS SPECTACLES MORE FIRMLY ON HIS NOSE AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM FOR THE INKSTAND IT WAS THE CRITICAL MOMENT OF OLIVERS FATE IF THE INKSTAND HAD BEEN WHERE THE OLD GENTLEMAN THOUGHT IT WAS HE WOULD HAVE DIPPED HIS PEN INTO IT AND SIGNED THE INDENTURES AND OLIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN STRAIGHTWAY HURRIED OFF BUT AS IT CHANCED TO BE IMMEDIATELY UNDER HIS NOSE IT FOLLOWED AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT HE LOOKED ALL OVER HIS DESK FOR IT WITHOUT FINDING IT AND HAPPENING IN THE COURSE OF HIS SEARCH TO LOOK STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM HIS GAZE ENCOUNTERED THE PALE AND TERRIFIED FACE OF OLIVER TWIST WHO DESPITE ALL THE ADMONITORY LOOKS AND PINCHES OF BUMBLE WAS REGARDING THE REPULSIVE COUNTENANCE OF HIS FUTURE MASTER WITH A MINGLED EXPRESSION OF HORROR AND FEAR TOO PALPABLE TO BE MISTAKEN EVEN BY A HALFBLIND MAGISTRATE THE OLD GENTLEMAN STOPPED LAID DOWN HIS PEN AND LOOKED FROM OLIVER TO MR LIMBKINS WHO ATTEMPTED TO TAKE SNUFF WITH A CHEERFUL AND UNCONCERNED ASPECT MY BOY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN YOU LOOK PALE AND ALARMED WHAT IS THE MATTER STAND A LITTLE AWAY FROM HIM BEADLE SAID THE OTHER MAGISTRATE LAYING ASIDE THE PAPER AND LEANING FORWARD WITH AN EXPRESSION OF INTEREST NOW BOY TELL US WHATS THE MATTER DONT BE AFRAID OLIVER FELL ON HIS KNEES AND CLASPING HIS HANDS TOGETHER PRAYED THAT THEY WOULD ORDER HIM BACK TO THE DARK ROOMTHAT THEY WOULD STARVE HIMBEAT HIMKILL HIM IF THEY PLEASEDRATHER THAN SEND HIM AWAY WITH THAT DREADFUL MAN WELL SAID MR BUMBLE RAISING HIS HANDS AND EYES WITH MOST IMPRESSIVE SOLEMNITY WELL OF ALL THE ARTFUL AND DESIGNING ORPHANS THAT EVER I SEE OLIVER YOU ARE ONE OF THE MOST BAREFACEDEST HOLD YOUR TONGUE BEADLE SAID THE SECOND OLD GENTLEMAN WHEN MR BUMBLE HAD GIVEN VENT TO THIS COMPOUND ADJECTIVE I BEG YOUR WORSHIPS PARDON SAID MR BUMBLE INCREDULOUS OF HAVING HEARD ARIGHT DID YOUR WORSHIP SPEAK TO ME YES HOLD YOUR TONGUE MR BUMBLE WAS STUPEFIED WITH ASTONISHMENT A BEADLE ORDERED TO HOLD HIS TONGUE A MORAL REVOLUTION THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE TORTOISESHELL SPECTACLES LOOKED AT HIS COMPANION HE NODDED SIGNIFICANTLY WE REFUSE TO SANCTION THESE INDENTURES SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN TOSSING ASIDE THE PIECE OF PARCHMENT AS HE SPOKE I HOPE STAMMERED MR LIMBKINS I HOPE THE MAGISTRATES WILL NOT FORM THE OPINION THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF ANY IMPROPER CONDUCT ON THE UNSUPPORTED TESTIMONY OF A CHILD THE MAGISTRATES ARE NOT CALLED UPON TO PRONOUNCE ANY OPINION ON THE MATTER SAID THE SECOND OLD GENTLEMAN SHARPLY TAKE THE BOY BACK TO THE WORKHOUSE AND TREAT HIM KINDLY HE SEEMS TO WANT IT THAT SAME EVENING THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT MOST POSITIVELY AND DECIDEDLY AFFIRMED NOT ONLY THAT OLIVER WOULD BE HUNG BUT THAT HE WOULD BE DRAWN AND QUARTERED INTO THE BARGAIN MR BUMBLE SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH GLOOMY MYSTERY AND SAID HE WISHED HE MIGHT COME TO GOOD WHEREUNTO MR GAMFIELD REPLIED THAT HE WISHED HE MIGHT COME TO HIM WHICH ALTHOUGH HE AGREED WITH THE BEADLE IN MOST MATTERS WOULD SEEM TO BE A WISH OF A TOTALLY OPPOSITE DESCRIPTION THE NEXT MORNING THE PUBLIC WERE ONCE INFORMED THAT OLIVER TWIST WAS AGAIN TO LET AND THAT FIVE POUNDS WOULD BE PAID TO ANYBODY WHO WOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF HIM CHAPTER IV OLIVER BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE IN GREAT FAMILIES WHEN AN ADVANTAGEOUS PLACE CANNOT BE OBTAINED EITHER IN POSSESSION REVERSION REMAINDER OR EXPECTANCY FOR THE YOUNG MAN WHO IS GROWING UP IT IS A VERY GENERAL CUSTOM TO SEND HIM TO SEA THE BOARD IN IMITATION OF SO WISE AND SALUTARY AN EXAMPLE TOOK COUNSEL TOGETHER ON THE EXPEDIENCY OF SHIPPING OFF OLIVER TWIST IN SOME SMALL TRADING VESSEL BOUND TO A GOOD UNHEALTHY PORT THIS SUGGESTED ITSELF AS THE VERY BEST THING THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE DONE WITH HIM THE PROBABILITY BEING THAT THE SKIPPER WOULD FLOG HIM TO DEATH IN A PLAYFUL MOOD SOME DAY AFTER DINNER OR WOULD KNOCK HIS BRAINS OUT WITH AN IRON BAR BOTH PASTIMES BEING AS IS PRETTY GENERALLY KNOWN VERY FAVOURITE AND COMMON RECREATIONS AMONG GENTLEMAN OF THAT CLASS THE MORE THE CASE PRESENTED ITSELF TO THE BOARD IN THIS POINT OF VIEW THE MORE MANIFOLD THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STEP APPEARED SO THEY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ONLY WAY OF PROVIDING FOR OLIVER EFFECTUALLY WAS TO SEND HIM TO SEA WITHOUT DELAY MR BUMBLE HAD BEEN DESPATCHED TO MAKE VARIOUS PRELIMINARY INQUIRIES WITH THE VIEW OF FINDING OUT SOME CAPTAIN OR OTHER WHO WANTED A CABINBOY WITHOUT ANY FRIENDS AND WAS RETURNING TO THE WORKHOUSE TO COMMUNICATE THE RESULT OF HIS MISSION WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED AT THE GATE NO LESS A PERSON THAN MR SOWERBERRY THE PAROCHIAL UNDERTAKER MR SOWERBERRY WAS A TALL GAUNT LARGEJOINTED MAN ATTIRED IN A SUIT OF THREADBARE BLACK WITH DARNED COTTON STOCKINGS OF THE SAME COLOUR AND SHOES TO ANSWER HIS FEATURES WERE NOT NATURALLY INTENDED TO WEAR A SMILING ASPECT BUT HE WAS IN GENERAL RATHER GIVEN TO PROFESSIONAL JOCOSITY HIS STEP WAS ELASTIC AND HIS FACE BETOKENED INWARD PLEASANTRY AS HE ADVANCED TO MR BUMBLE AND SHOOK HIM CORDIALLY BY THE HAND I HAVE TAKEN THE MEASURE OF THE TWO WOMEN THAT DIED LAST NIGHT MR BUMBLE SAID THE UNDERTAKER YOULL MAKE YOUR FORTUNE MR SOWERBERRY SAID THE BEADLE AS HE THRUST HIS THUMB AND FOREFINGER INTO THE PROFFERED SNUFFBOX OF THE UNDERTAKER WHICH WAS AN INGENIOUS LITTLE MODEL OF A PATENT COFFIN I SAY YOULL MAKE YOUR FORTUNE MR SOWERBERRY REPEATED MR BUMBLE TAPPING THE UNDERTAKER ON THE SHOULDER IN A FRIENDLY MANNER WITH HIS CANE THINK SO SAID THE UNDERTAKER IN A TONE WHICH HALF ADMITTED AND HALF DISPUTED THE PROBABILITY OF THE EVENT THE PRICES ALLOWED BY THE BOARD ARE VERY SMALL MR BUMBLE SO ARE THE COFFINS REPLIED THE BEADLE WITH PRECISELY AS NEAR AN APPROACH TO A LAUGH AS A GREAT OFFICIAL OUGHT TO INDULGE IN MR SOWERBERRY WAS MUCH TICKLED AT THIS AS OF COURSE HE OUGHT TO BE AND LAUGHED A LONG TIME WITHOUT CESSATION WELL WELL MR BUMBLE HE SAID AT LENGTH THERES NO DENYING THAT SINCE THE NEW SYSTEM OF FEEDING HAS COME IN THE COFFINS ARE SOMETHING NARROWER AND MORE SHALLOW THAN THEY USED TO BE BUT WE MUST HAVE SOME PROFIT MR BUMBLE WELLSEASONED TIMBER IS AN EXPENSIVE ARTICLE SIR AND ALL THE IRON HANDLES COME BY CANAL FROM BIRMINGHAM WELL WELL SAID MR BUMBLE EVERY TRADE HAS ITS DRAWBACKS A FAIR PROFIT IS OF COURSE ALLOWABLE OF COURSE OF COURSE REPLIED THE UNDERTAKER AND IF I DONT GET A PROFIT UPON THIS OR THAT PARTICULAR ARTICLE WHY I MAKE IT UP IN THE LONGRUN YOU SEEHE HE HE JUST SO SAID MR BUMBLE THOUGH I MUST SAY CONTINUED THE UNDERTAKER RESUMING THE CURRENT OF OBSERVATIONS WHICH THE BEADLE HAD INTERRUPTED THOUGH I MUST SAY MR BUMBLE THAT I HAVE TO CONTEND AGAINST ONE VERY GREAT DISADVANTAGE WHICH IS THAT ALL THE STOUT PEOPLE GO OFF THE QUICKEST THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF AND HAVE PAID RATES FOR MANY YEARS ARE THE FIRST TO SINK WHEN THEY COME INTO THE HOUSE AND LET ME TELL YOU MR BUMBLE THAT THREE OR FOUR INCHES OVER ONES CALCULATION MAKES A GREAT HOLE IN ONES PROFITS ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE HAS A FAMILY TO PROVIDE FOR SIR AS MR SOWERBERRY SAID THIS WITH THE BECOMING INDIGNATION OF AN ILLUSED MAN AND AS MR BUMBLE FELT THAT IT RATHER TENDED TO CONVEY A REFLECTION ON THE HONOUR OF THE PARISH THE LATTER GENTLEMAN THOUGHT IT ADVISABLE TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT OLIVER TWIST BEING UPPERMOST IN HIS MIND HE MADE HIM HIS THEME BY THE BYE SAID MR BUMBLE YOU DONT KNOW ANYBODY WHO WANTS A BOY DO YOU A POROCHIAL PRENTIS WHO IS AT PRESENT A DEADWEIGHT A MILLSTONE AS I MAY SAY ROUND THE POROCHIAL THROAT LIBERAL TERMS MR SOWERBERRY LIBERAL TERMS AS MR BUMBLE SPOKE HE RAISED HIS CANE TO THE BILL ABOVE HIM AND GAVE THREE DISTINCT RAPS UPON THE WORDS FIVE POUNDS WHICH WERE PRINTED THEREON IN ROMAN CAPITALS OF GIGANTIC SIZE GADSO SAID THE UNDERTAKER TAKING MR BUMBLE BY THE GILTEDGED LAPPEL OF HIS OFFICIAL COAT THATS JUST THE VERY THING I WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT YOU KNOWDEAR ME WHAT A VERY ELEGANT BUTTON THIS IS MR BUMBLE I NEVER NOTICED IT BEFORE YES I THINK IT RATHER PRETTY SAID THE BEADLE GLANCING PROUDLY DOWNWARDS AT THE LARGE BRASS BUTTONS WHICH EMBELLISHED HIS COAT THE DIE IS THE SAME AS THE POROCHIAL SEALTHE GOOD SAMARITAN HEALING THE SICK AND BRUISED MAN THE BOARD PRESENTED IT TO ME ON NEWYEARS MORNING MR SOWERBERRY I PUT IT ON I REMEMBER FOR THE FIRST TIME TO ATTEND THE INQUEST ON THAT REDUCED TRADESMAN WHO DIED IN A DOORWAY AT MIDNIGHT I RECOLLECT SAID THE UNDERTAKER THE JURY BROUGHT IT IN DIED FROM EXPOSURE TO THE COLD AND WANT OF THE COMMON NECESSARIES OF LIFE DIDNT THEY MR BUMBLE NODDED AND THEY MADE IT A SPECIAL VERDICT I THINK SAID THE UNDERTAKER BY ADDING SOME WORDS TO THE EFFECT THAT IF THE RELIEVING OFFICER HAD TUSH FOOLERY INTERPOSED THE BEADLE IF THE BOARD ATTENDED TO ALL THE NONSENSE THAT IGNORANT JURYMEN TALK THEYD HAVE ENOUGH TO DO VERY TRUE SAID THE UNDERTAKER THEY WOULD INDEED JURIES SAID MR BUMBLE GRASPING HIS CANE TIGHTLY AS WAS HIS WONT WHEN WORKING INTO A PASSION JURIES IS INEDDICATED VULGAR GROVELLING WRETCHES SO THEY ARE SAID THE UNDERTAKER THEY HAVENT NO MORE PHILOSOPHY NOR POLITICAL ECONOMY ABOUT EM THAN THAT SAID THE BEADLE SNAPPING HIS FINGERS CONTEMPTUOUSLY NO MORE THEY HAVE ACQUIESCED THE UNDERTAKER I DESPISE EM SAID THE BEADLE GROWING VERY RED IN THE FACE SO DO I REJOINED THE UNDERTAKER AND I ONLY WISH WED A JURY OF THE INDEPENDENT SORT IN THE HOUSE FOR A WEEK OR TWO SAID THE BEADLE THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE BOARD WOULD SOON BRING THEIR SPIRIT DOWN FOR EM LET EM ALONE FOR THAT REPLIED THE UNDERTAKER SO SAYING HE SMILED APPROVINGLY TO CALM THE RISING WRATH OF THE INDIGNANT PARISH OFFICER MR BUMBLE LIFTED OFF HIS COCKED HAT TOOK A HANDKERCHIEF FROM THE INSIDE OF THE CROWN WIPED FROM HIS FOREHEAD THE PERSPIRATION WHICH HIS RAGE HAD ENGENDERED FIXED THE COCKED HAT ON AGAIN AND TURNING TO THE UNDERTAKER SAID IN A CALMER VOICE WELL WHAT ABOUT THE BOY OH REPLIED THE UNDERTAKER WHY YOU KNOW MR BUMBLE I PAY A GOOD DEAL TOWARDS THE POORS RATES HEM SAID MR BUMBLE WELL WELL REPLIED THE UNDERTAKER I WAS THINKING THAT IF I PAY SO MUCH TOWARDS EM IVE A RIGHT TO GET AS MUCH OUT OF EM AS I CAN MR BUMBLE AND SOI THINK ILL TAKE THE BOY MYSELF MR BUMBLE GRASPED THE UNDERTAKER BY THE ARM AND LED HIM INTO THE BUILDING MR SOWERBERRY WAS CLOSETED WITH THE BOARD FOR FIVE MINUTES AND IT WAS ARRANGED THAT OLIVER SHOULD GO TO HIM THAT EVENING UPON LIKINGA PHRASE WHICH MEANS IN THE CASE OF A PARISH APPRENTICE THAT IF THE MASTER FIND UPON A SHORT TRIAL THAT HE CAN GET ENOUGH WORK OUT OF A BOY WITHOUT PUTTING TOO MUCH FOOD INTO HIM HE SHALL HAVE HIM FOR A TERM OF YEARS TO DO WHAT HE LIKES WITH WHEN LITTLE OLIVER WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE GENTLEMEN THAT EVENING AND INFORMED THAT HE WAS TO GO THAT NIGHT AS GENERAL HOUSELAD TO A COFFINMAKERS AND THAT IF HE COMPLAINED OF HIS SITUATION OR EVER CAME BACK TO THE PARISH AGAIN HE WOULD BE SENT TO SEA THERE TO BE DROWNED OR KNOCKED ON THE HEAD AS THE CASE MIGHT BE HE EVINCED SO LITTLE EMOTION THAT THEY BY COMMON CONSENT PRONOUNCED HIM A HARDENED YOUNG RASCAL AND ORDERED MR BUMBLE TO REMOVE HIM FORTHWITH NOW ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY NATURAL THAT THE BOARD OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD SHOULD FEEL IN A GREAT STATE OF VIRTUOUS ASTONISHMENT AND HORROR AT THE SMALLEST TOKENS OF WANT OF FEELING ON THE PART OF ANYBODY THEY WERE RATHER OUT IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE THE SIMPLE FACT WAS THAT OLIVER INSTEAD OF POSSESSING TOO LITTLE FEELING POSSESSED RATHER TOO MUCH AND WAS IN A FAIR WAY OF BEING REDUCED FOR LIFE TO A STATE OF BRUTAL STUPIDITY AND SULLENNESS BY THE ILL USAGE HE HAD RECEIVED HE HEARD THE NEWS OF HIS DESTINATION IN PERFECT SILENCE AND HAVING HAD HIS LUGGAGE PUT INTO HIS HANDWHICH WAS NOT VERY DIFFICULT TO CARRY INASMUCH AS IT WAS ALL COMPRISED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A BROWN PAPER PARCEL ABOUT HALF A FOOT SQUARE BY THREE INCHES DEEPHE PULLED HIS CAP OVER HIS EYES AND ONCE MORE ATTACHING HIMSELF TO MR BUMBLES COAT CUFF WAS LED AWAY BY THAT DIGNITARY TO A NEW SCENE OF SUFFERING FOR SOME TIME MR BUMBLE DREW OLIVER ALONG WITHOUT NOTICE OR REMARK FOR THE BEADLE CARRIED HIS HEAD VERY ERECT AS A BEADLE ALWAYS SHOULD AND IT BEING A WINDY DAY LITTLE OLIVER WAS COMPLETELY ENSHROUDED BY THE SKIRTS OF MR BUMBLES COAT AS THEY BLEW OPEN AND DISCLOSED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE HIS FLAPPED WAISTCOAT AND DRAB PLUSH KNEEBREECHES AS THEY DREW NEAR TO THEIR DESTINATION HOWEVER MR BUMBLE THOUGHT IT EXPEDIENT TO LOOK DOWN AND SEE THAT THE BOY WAS IN GOOD ORDER FOR INSPECTION BY HIS NEW MASTER WHICH HE ACCORDINGLY DID WITH A FIT AND BECOMING AIR OF GRACIOUS PATRONAGE OLIVER SAID MR BUMBLE YES SIR REPLIED OLIVER IN A LOW TREMULOUS VOICE PULL THAT CAP OFF YOUR EYES AND HOLD UP YOUR HEAD SIR ALTHOUGH OLIVER DID AS HE WAS DESIRED AT ONCE AND PASSED THE BACK OF HIS UNOCCUPIED HAND BRISKLY ACROSS HIS EYES HE LEFT A TEAR IN THEM WHEN HE LOOKED UP AT HIS CONDUCTOR AS MR BUMBLE GAZED STERNLY UPON HIM IT ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEK IT WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER AND ANOTHER THE CHILD MADE A STRONG EFFORT BUT IT WAS AN UNSUCCESSFUL ONE WITHDRAWING HIS OTHER HAND FROM MR BUMBLES HE COVERED HIS FACE WITH BOTH AND WEPT UNTIL THE TEARS SPRUNG OUT FROM BETWEEN HIS CHIN AND BONY FINGERS WELL EXCLAIMED MR BUMBLE STOPPING SHORT AND DARTING AT HIS LITTLE CHARGE A LOOK OF INTENSE MALIGNITY WELL OF

OR FOUR TIMES IN A HUSKY MANNER AND AFTER MUTTERING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT TROUBLESOME COUGH BADE OLIVER DRY HIS EYES AND BE A GOOD BOY THEN ONCE MORE TAKING HIS HAND HE WALKED ON WITH HIM IN SILENCE THE UNDERTAKER WHO HAD JUST PUT UP THE SHUTTERS OF HIS SHOP WAS MAKING SOME ENTRIES IN HIS DAYBOOK BY THE LIGHT OF A MOST APPROPRIATE DISMAL CANDLE WHEN MR BUMBLE ENTERED AHA SAID THE UNDERTAKER LOOKING UP FROM THE BOOK AND PAUSING IN THE MIDDLE OF A WORD IS THAT YOU BUMBLE NO ONE ELSE MR SOWERBERRY REPLIED THE BEADLE HERE IVE BROUGHT THE BOY OLIVER MADE A BOW OH THATS THE BOY IS IT SAID THE

UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTERS BUSINESS OLIVER BEING LEFT TO HIMSELF IN THE UNDERTAKERS SHOP SET THE LAMP DOWN ON A WORKMANS BENCH AND GAZED TIMIDLY ABOUT HIM WITH A FEELING OF AWE AND DREAD WHICH MANY PEOPLE A GOOD DEAL OLDER THAN HE WILL BE AT NO LOSS TO UNDERSTAND AN UNFINISHED COFFIN ON BLACK TRESSELS WHICH STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP LOOKED SO GLOOMY AND DEATHLIKE THAT A COLD TREMBLE CAME OVER HIM EVERY TIME HIS EYES WANDERED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DISMAL OBJECT FROM WHICH HE ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE SOME FRIGHTFUL FORM SLOWLY REAR ITS HEAD TO DRIVE HIM MAD WITH TERROR AGAINST THE WALL WERE RANGED IN REGULAR ARRAY A LONG ROW OF ELM BOARDS CUT IN THE SAME SHAPE LOOKING IN THE DIM LIGHT LIKE HIGHSHOULDERED GHOSTS WITH THEIR HANDS IN THEIR BREECHES POCKETS COFFINPLATES ELMCHIPS BRIGHTHEADED NAILS AND SHREDS OF BLACK CLOTH LAY SCATTERED ON THE FLOOR AND THE WALL BEHIND THE COUNTER WAS ORNAMENTED WITH A LIVELY REPRESENTATION OF TWO MUTES IN VERY STIFF NECKCLOTHS ON DUTY AT A LARGE PRIVATE DOOR WITH A HEARSE DRAWN BY FOUR BLACK STEEDS APPROACHING IN THE DISTANCE THE SHOP WAS CLOSE AND HOT THE ATMOSPHERE SEEMED TAINTED WITH THE SMELL OF COFFINS THE RECESS BENEATH THE COUNTER IN WHICH HIS FLOCK MATTRESS WAS THRUST LOOKED LIKE A GRAVE NOR WERE THESE THE ONLY DISMAL FEELINGS WHICH DEPRESSED OLIVER HE WAS ALONE IN A STRANGE PLACE AND WE ALL KNOW HOW CHILLED AND DESOLATE THE BEST OF US WILL SOMETIMES FEEL IN SUCH A SITUATION THE BOY HAD NO FRIENDS TO CARE FOR OR TO CARE FOR HIM THE REGRET OF NO RECENT SEPARATION WAS FRESH IN HIS MIND THE ABSENCE OF NO LOVED AND WELLREMEMBERED FACE SANK HEAVILY INTO HIS HEART BUT HIS HEART WAS HEAVY NOTWITHSTANDING AND HE WISHED AS HE CREPT INTO HIS NARROW BED THAT THAT WERE HIS COFFIN AND THAT HE COULD BE LAIN IN A CALM AND LASTING SLEEP IN THE CHURCHYARD GROUND WITH THE TALL GRASS WAVING GENTLY ABOVE HIS HEAD AND THE SOUND OF THE OLD DEEP BELL TO SOOTHE HIM IN HIS SLEEP OLIVER WAS AWAKENED IN THE MORNING BY A LOUD KICKING AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHOPDOOR WHICH BEFORE HE COULD HUDDLE ON HIS CLOTHES WAS REPEATED IN AN ANGRY AND IMPETUOUS MANNER ABOUT TWENTYFIVE TIMES WHEN HE BEGAN TO UNDO THE CHAIN THE LEGS

MONOSYLLABLE JUST RECORDED BEARS REFERENCE TO ENTERTAIN THE SMALLEST DOUBT THAT THE OWNER OF THE VOICE WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE WOULD REDEEM HIS PLEDGE MOST HONOURABLY HE DREW BACK THE BOLTS WITH A TREMBLING HAND AND OPENED THE DOOR FOR A SECOND OR TWO OLIVER GLANCED UP THE STREET AND DOWN THE STREET AND OVER THE WAY IMPRESSED WITH THE BELIEF THAT THE UNKNOWN WHO HAD ADDRESSED HIM THROUGH THE KEYHOLE HAD WALKED A FEW PACES OFF TO WARM HIMSELF FOR NOBODY DID HE SEE BUT A BIG CHARITYBOY SITTING ON A POST IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE EATING A SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER WHICH HE CUT INTO WEDGES THE

SAID THE CHARITYBOY AND YOURE UNDER ME TAKE DOWN THE SHUTTERS YER IDLE YOUNG RUFFIAN WITH THIS MR CLAYPOLE ADMINISTERED A KICK TO OLIVER AND ENTERED THE SHOP WITH A DIGNIFIED AIR WHICH DID HIM GREAT CREDIT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A LARGEHEADED SMALLEYED YOUTH OF LUMBERING MAKE AND HEAVY COUNTENANCE TO LOOK DIGNIFIED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT IS MORE ESPECIALLY SO WHEN SUPERADDED TO THESE PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS ARE A RED NOSE AND YELLOW SMALLS OLIVER HAVING TAKEN DOWN THE SHUTTERS AND BROKEN A PANE OF GLASS IN HIS EFFORT TO STAGGER AWAY BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF THE FIRST ONE TO A SMALL COURT AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE KEPT DURING THE DAY WAS GRACIOUSLY ASSISTED BY NOAH WHO HAVING CONSOLED HIM WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HED CATCH IT CONDESCENDED TO HELP HIM MR

SCORNFULLY AT POOR OLIVER TWIST AS HE SAT SHIVERING ON THE BOX IN THE COLDEST CORNER OF THE ROOM AND ATE THE STALE PIECES WHICH HAD BEEN SPECIALLY RESERVED FOR HIM NOAH WAS A CHARITYBOY BUT NOT A WORKHOUSE ORPHAN NO CHANCECHILD WAS HE FOR HE COULD TRACE HIS GENEALOGY ALL THE WAY BACK TO HIS PARENTS WHO LIVED HARD BY HIS MOTHER BEING A WASHERWOMAN AND HIS FATHER A DRUNKEN SOLDIER DISCHARGED WITH A WOODEN LEG AND A DIURNAL PENSION OF TWOPENCEHALFPENNY AND AN UNSTATEABLE FRACTION THE SHOPBOYS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD LONG BEEN IN THE HABIT OF BRANDING NOAH IN THE PUBLIC STREETS WITH THE IGNOMINIOUS EPITHETS OF LEATHERS CHARITY AND THE LIKE AND NOAH HAD BOURNE THEM WITHOUT REPLY BUT NOW THAT FORTUNE HAD CAST IN HIS WAY A NAMELESS ORPHAN AT WHOM EVEN THE MEANEST COULD POINT THE FINGER OF SCORN HE RETORTED ON HIM WITH INTEREST THIS AFFORDS CHARMING FOOD FOR CONTEMPLATION IT SHOWS US WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING HUMAN NATURE MAY BE MADE TO BE AND HOW IMPARTIALLY THE SAME AMIABLE QUALITIES ARE DEVELOPED IN THE FINEST LORD AND THE DIRTIEST CHARITYBOY OLIVER HAD BEEN SOJOURNING AT THE UNDERTAKERS SOME THREE WEEKS OR A MONTH MR AND MRS SOWERBERRYTHE SHOP BEING SHUT UPWERE TAKING THEIR

MUTE IN PROPORTION MY DEAR YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT IT WOULD HAVE A SUPERB EFFECT MRS SOWERBERRY WHO HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TASTE IN THE UNDERTAKING WAY WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE NOVELTY OF THIS IDEA BUT AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPROMISING HER DIGNITY TO HAVE SAID SO UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES SHE MERELY INQUIRED WITH MUCH SHARPNESS WHY SUCH AN OBVIOUS SUGGESTION HAD NOT PRESENTED ITSELF TO HER HUSBANDS MIND BEFORE MR SOWERBERRY RIGHTLY CONSTRUED THIS AS AN ACQUIESCENCE IN HIS PROPOSITION IT WAS SPEEDILY DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT OLIVER SHOULD BE AT ONCE INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF THE TRADE AND WITH THIS VIEW THAT HE SHOULD ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER ON THE VERY NEXT OCCASION OF HIS SERVICES BEING REQUIRED THE OCCASION WAS NOT LONG IN COMING HALF AN HOUR AFTER BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING MR BUMBLE ENTERED THE SHOP AND SUPPORTING HIS CANE AGAINST THE COUNTER DREW FORTH HIS LARGE LEATHERN POCKETBOOK FROM WHICH HE SELECTED A SMALL SCRAP OF PAPER WHICH HE HANDED OVER TO SOWERBERRY AHA SAID THE UNDERTAKER GLANCING OVER IT WITH A LIVELY COUNTENANCE AN ORDER FOR A COFFIN EH FOR A COFFIN FIRST AND A POROCHIAL FUNERAL AFTERWARDS REPLIED MR BUMBLE FASTENING THE STRAP OF THE LEATHERN POCKETBOOK WHICH LIKE HIMSELF WAS VERY CORPULENT BAYTON SAID THE UNDERTAKER LOOKING FROM THE SCRAP OF PAPER TO MR BUMBLE I NEVER HEARD THE NAME BEFORE BUMBLE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE REPLIED OBSTINATE PEOPLE MR

SO ANGRY OLIVER THAT HE FORGOT EVEN TO ASK AFTER YOU SAID MR SOWERBERRY LOOKING AFTER THE BEADLE AS HE STRODE DOWN THE STREET YES SIR REPLIED OLIVER WHO HAD CAREFULLY KEPT HIMSELF OUT OF SIGHT DURING THE INTERVIEW AND WHO WAS SHAKING FROM HEAD TO FOOT AT THE MERE RECOLLECTION OF THE SOUND OF MR BUMBLES VOICE HE NEEDNT HAVEN TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO SHRINK FROM MR BUMBLES GLANCE HOWEVER FOR THAT FUNCTIONARY ON WHOM THE PREDICTION OF THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE WAISTCOAT HAD MADE A VERY STRONG IMPRESSION THOUGHT THAT NOW THE UNDERTAKER HAD GOT OLIVER UPON TRIAL THE SUBJECT WAS BETTER AVOIDED UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE SHOULD BE FIRMLY BOUND FOR SEVEN YEARS AND ALL DANGER OF HIS BEING RETURNED UPON THE HANDS OF THE PARISH SHOULD BE THUS EFFECTUALLY AND LEGALLY OVERCOME WELL SAID MR SOWERBERRY TAKING UP HIS HAT THE SOONER THIS JOB IS DONE THE BETTER NOAH LOOK AFTER THE SHOP OLIVER PUT ON YOUR CAP AND COME WITH ME OLIVER OBEYED AND FOLLOWED HIS MASTER ON HIS PROFESSIONAL MISSION THEY WALKED ON FOR SOME TIME THROUGH THE MOST CROWDED AND DENSELY INHABITED PART OF THE TOWN AND THEN STRIKING DOWN A NARROW STREET MORE DIRTY AND MISERABLE THAN ANY THEY HAD YET PASSED THROUGH PAUSED TO LOOK FOR THE HOUSE WHICH WAS THE OBJECT OF THEIR SEARCH THE HOUSES ON EITHER SIDE WERE HIGH AND LARGE BUT VERY OLD AND TENANTED BY PEOPLE OF THE POOREST CLASS AS THEIR NEGLECTED APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENTLY DENOTED WITHOUT THE CONCURRENT TESTIMONY AFFORDED BY THE SQUALID LOOKS OF THE FEW MEN AND WOMEN WHO WITH FOLDED ARMS AND BODIES HALF DOUBLED OCCASIONALLY SKULKED ALONG A GREAT MANY OF THE TENEMENTS HAD SHOPFRONTS BUT THESE WERE FAST CLOSED AND MOULDERING AWAY ONLY THE UPPER ROOMS BEING INHABITED SOME HOUSES WHICH HAD BECOME INSECURE FROM AGE AND DECAY WERE PREVENTED FROM FALLING INTO THE STREET BY HUGE BEAMS OF WOOD REARED AGAINST THE WALLS AND FIRMLY PLANTED IN THE ROAD BUT EVEN THESE CRAZY DENS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS THE NIGHTLY HAUNTS OF SOME HOUSELESS WRETCHES FOR MANY OF THE ROUGH BOARDS WHICH SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF DOOR AND WINDOW WERE WRENCHED FROM THEIR POSITIONS TO AFFORD AN APERTURE WIDE ENOUGH FOR THE PASSAGE OF A HUMAN BODY THE KENNEL WAS STAGNANT AND FILTHY THE VERY RATS WHICH HERE AND THERE LAY PUTREFYING IN ITS ROTTENNESS WERE HIDEOUS WITH FAMINE THERE WAS NEITHER KNOCKER NOR BELLHANDLE AT THE OPEN DOOR WHERE OLIVER AND HIS MASTER STOPPED SO GROPING HIS WAY CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE DARK PASSAGE AND BIDDING OLIVER KEEP CLOSE TO HIM AND NOT BE AFRAID THE UNDERTAKER MOUNTED TO THE TOP OF THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STAIRS STUMBLING AGAINST A DOOR ON THE LANDING HE RAPPED AT IT WITH HIS KNUCKLES IT WAS OPENED BY A YOUNG GIRL OF THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN THE UNDERTAKER AT ONCE SAW ENOUGH OF WHAT THE ROOM CONTAINED TO KNOW IT WAS THE APARTMENT TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED HE STEPPED IN OLIVER FOLLOWED HIM THERE WAS NO FIRE IN THE ROOM BUT A MAN WAS CROUCHING MECHANICALLY OVER THE EMPTY STOVE AN OLD WOMAN TOO HAD DRAWN A LOW STOOL TO THE COLD HEARTH AND WAS SITTING BESIDE HIM THERE WERE SOME RAGGED CHILDREN IN ANOTHER CORNER AND IN A SMALL RECESS OPPOSITE THE DOOR THERE LAY UPON THE GROUND SOMETHING COVERED WITH AN OLD BLANKET OLIVER SHUDDERED AS HE CAST HIS EYES TOWARD THE PLACE AND CREPT INVOLUNTARILY CLOSER TO HIS MASTER FOR THOUGH IT WAS COVERED UP THE BOY FELT THAT IT WAS A CORPSE THE MANS FACE WAS THIN AND VERY PALE HIS HAIR AND BEARD WERE GRIZZLY HIS EYES WERE BLOODSHOT THE OLD WOMANS FACE WAS WRINKLED HER TWO REMAINING TEETH PROTRUDED OVER HER UNDER LIP AND HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND PIERCING OLIVER WAS AFRAID TO LOOK AT EITHER HER OR THE MAN THEY SEEMED SO LIKE THE RATS HE HAD SEEN OUTSIDE NOBODY SHALL GO NEAR HER SAID THE MAN STARTING FIERCELY UP AS THE UNDERTAKER APPROACHED THE RECESS KEEP BACK DAMN YOU KEEP BACK IF YOUVE A LIFE TO LOSE NONSENSE MY GOOD MAN SAID THE UNDERTAKER WHO WAS PRETTY WELL USED TO MISERY IN ALL ITS SHAPES NONSENSE I TELL YOU SAID THE MAN CLENCHING HIS HANDS AND STAMPING FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOORI TELL YOU I WONT HAVE HER PUT INTO THE GROUND SHE COULDNT REST THERE THE WORMS WOULD WORRY HERNOT EAT HERSHE IS SO WORN AWAY THE UNDERTAKER OFFERED NO REPLY TO THIS RAVING BUT PRODUCING A TAPE FROM HIS POCKET KNELT DOWN FOR A MOMENT BY THE SIDE OF THE BODY AH SAID THE MAN BURSTING INTO TEARS AND SINKING ON HIS KNEES AT THE FEET OF THE DEAD WOMAN KNEEL DOWN KNEEL DOWNKNEEL ROUND HER EVERY ONE OF YOU AND MARK MY WORDS I SAY SHE WAS STARVED TO DEATH I NEVER KNEW HOW BAD SHE WAS TILL THE FEVER CAME UPON HER AND THEN HER BONES WERE STARTING THROUGH THE SKIN THERE WAS NEITHER FIRE NOR CANDLE SHE DIED IN THE DARKIN THE DARK SHE COULDNT EVEN SEE HER CHILDRENS FACES THOUGH WE HEARD HER GASPING OUT THEIR NAMES I BEGGED FOR HER IN THE STREETS AND THEY SENT ME TO PRISON WHEN I CAME BACK SHE WAS DYING AND ALL THE BLOOD IN MY HEART HAS DRIED UP FOR THEY STARVED HER TO DEATH I SWEAR IT BEFORE THE GOD THAT SAW IT THEY STARVED HER HE TWINED HIS HANDS IN HIS HAIR AND WITH A LOUD SCREAM ROLLED GROVELLING UPON THE FLOOR HIS EYES FIXED AND THE FOAM COVERING HIS LIPS THE TERRIFIED CHILDREN CRIED BITTERLY BUT THE OLD WOMAN WHO HAD HITHERTO REMAINED AS QUIET AS IF SHE HAD BEEN WHOLLY DEAF TO ALL THAT PASSED MENACED THEM INTO SILENCE HAVING UNLOOSENED THE CRAVAT OF THE MAN WHO STILL REMAINED EXTENDED ON THE GROUND SHE TOTTERED TOWARDS THE UNDERTAKER SHE WAS MY DAUGHTER SAID THE OLD WOMAN NODDING HER HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CORPSE AND SPEAKING WITH AN IDIOTIC LEER MORE GHASTLY THAN EVEN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH IN SUCH A PLACE LORD LORD WELL IT IS STRANGE THAT I WHO GAVE BIRTH TO HER AND WAS A WOMAN THEN SHOULD BE ALIVE AND MERRY NOW AND SHE LYING THERE SO COLD AND STIFF LORD LORDTO THINK OF IT ITS AS GOOD AS A PLAYAS GOOD AS A PLAY AS THE WRETCHED CREATURE MUMBLED AND CHUCKLED IN HER

LARGE CLOAK A GOOD WARM ONE FOR IT IS BITTER COLD WE SHOULD HAVE CAKE AND WINE TOO BEFORE WE GO NEVER MIND SEND SOME BREADONLY A LOAF OF BREAD AND A CUP OF WATER SHALL WE HAVE SOME BREAD DEAR SHE SAID EAGERLY CATCHING AT THE UNDERTAKERS COAT AS HE ONCE MORE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR YES YES SAID THE UNDERTAKEROF COURSE ANYTHING YOU LIKE HE DISENGAGED HIMSELF FROM THE OLD WOMANS GRASP AND DRAWING OLIVER AFTER HIM HURRIED AWAY THE NEXT DAY THE FAMILY HAVING BEEN MEANWHILE RELIEVED WITH A HALFQUARTERN LOAF AND A PIECE OF CHEESE LEFT WITH THEM BY MR BUMBLE HIMSELF OLIVER AND HIS MASTER RETURNED TO THE MISERABLE ABODE WHERE MR BUMBLE HAD ALREADY ARRIVED ACCOMPANIED BY FOUR MEN FROM THE WORKHOUSE WHO WERE TO ACT AS BEARERS AN OLD BLACK CLOAK HAD BEEN THROWN OVER THE RAGS OF THE OLD WOMAN AND THE MAN AND THE BARE COFFIN HAVING BEEN SCREWED DOWN WAS HOISTED ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE BEARERS AND CARRIED INTO THE STREET NOW YOU MUST PUT YOUR BEST LEG FOREMOST OLD LADY WHISPERED SOWERBERRY IN THE OLD WOMANS EAR WE ARE RATHER LATE AND IT WONT DO TO KEEP THE CLERGYMAN WAITING MOVE ON MY MENAS QUICK AS YOU LIKE THUS DIRECTED THE BEARERS TROTTED ON UNDER THEIR LIGHT BURDEN AND THE TWO MOURNERS KEPT AS NEAR THEM AS THEY COULD MR BUMBLE AND SOWERBERRY WALKED AT A GOOD SMART PACE IN FRONT AND OLIVER WHOSE LEGS WERE NOT SO LONG AS HIS MASTERS RAN BY THE SIDE THERE WAS NOT SO GREAT A NECESSITY FOR HURRYING AS MR SOWERBERRY HAD ANTICIPATED HOWEVER FOR WHEN THEY REACHED THE OBSCURE CORNER OF THE CHURCHYARD IN WHICH THE NETTLES GREW AND WHERE THE PARISH GRAVES WERE MADE THE CLERGYMAN HAD NOT ARRIVED AND THE CLERK WHO WAS SITTING BY THE VESTRYROOM FIRE SEEMED TO THINK IT BY NO MEANS IMPROBABLE THAT IT MIGHT BE AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE HE CAME SO THEY PUT THE BIER ON THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE AND THE TWO MOURNERS WAITED PATIENTLY IN THE DAMP CLAY WITH A COLD RAIN DRIZZLING DOWN WHILE THE RAGGED BOYS WHOM THE SPECTACLE HAD ATTRACTED INTO THE CHURCHYARD PLAYED A NOISY GAME AT HIDEANDSEEK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES OR VARIED THEIR AMUSEMENTS BY JUMPING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS OVER THE COFFIN MR SOWERBERRY AND BUMBLE BEING PERSONAL FRIENDS OF THE CLERK SAT BY THE FIRE WITH HIM AND READ THE PAPER AT LENGTH AFTER A LAPSE OF SOMETHING MORE THAN AN HOUR MR BUMBLE AND SOWERBERRY AND THE CLERK WERE SEEN RUNNING TOWARDS THE GRAVE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS THE CLERGYMAN APPEARED PUTTING ON HIS SURPLICE AS HE CAME ALONG MR BUMBLE THEN THRASHED A BOY OR TWO TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES AND THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN HAVING READ AS MUCH OF THE BURIAL SERVICE AS COULD BE COMPRESSED INTO FOUR MINUTES GAVE HIS SURPLICE TO THE CLERK AND WALKED AWAY AGAIN NOW BILL SAID SOWERBERRY TO THE GRAVEDIGGER FILL UP IT WAS NO VERY DIFFICULT TASK FOR THE GRAVE WAS SO FULL THAT THE UPPERMOST COFFIN WAS WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SURFACE THE GRAVEDIGGER SHOVELLED IN THE EARTH STAMPED IT LOOSELY DOWN WITH HIS FEET SHOULDERED HIS SPADE AND WALKED OFF FOLLOWED BY THE BOYS WHO MURMURED VERY LOUD COMPLAINTS AT THE FUN BEING OVER SO SOON COME MY GOOD FELLOW SAID BUMBLE TAPPING THE MAN ON THE BACK THEY WANT TO SHUT UP THE YARD THE MAN WHO HAD NEVER ONCE MOVED SINCE HE HAD TAKEN HIS STATION BY THE GRAVE SIDE STARTED RAISED HIS HEAD STARED AT THE PERSON WHO HAD ADDRESSED HIM WALKED FORWARD FOR A FEW PACES AND FELL DOWN IN A SWOON THE CRAZY OLD WOMAN WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN BEWAILING THE LOSS OF HER CLOAK WHICH THE UNDERTAKER HAD TAKEN OFF TO PAY HIM ANY ATTENTION SO THEY THREW A CAN OF COLD WATER OVER HIM AND WHEN HE CAME TO SAW HIM SAFELY OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD LOCKED THE GATE AND DEPARTED ON THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS WELL OLIVER SAID SOWERBERRY AS THEY WALKED HOME HOW DO YOU LIKE IT PRETTY WELL THANK YOU SIR REPLIED OLIVER WITH CONSIDERABLE HESITATION NOT VERY MUCH SIR AH YOULL GET USED TO IT IN TIME OLIVER SAID SOWERBERRY NOTHING WHEN YOU ARE USED TO IT MY BOY OLIVER WONDERED IN HIS OWN MIND WHETHER IT HAD TAKEN A VERY LONG TIME TO GET MR SOWERBERRY USED TO IT BUT HE THOUGHT IT BETTER NOT TO ASK THE QUESTION AND WALKED BACK TO THE SHOP THINKING OVER ALL HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD CHAPTER VI OLIVER BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH ROUSES INTO ACTION AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM THE MONTHS TRIAL OVER OLIVER WAS FORMALLY APPRENTICED IT WAS A NICE SICKLY SEASON JUST AT THIS TIME IN COMMERCIAL PHRASE COFFINS WERE LOOKING UP AND IN THE COURSE OF A FEW WEEKS OLIVER ACQUIRED A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE THE SUCCESS OF MR SOWERBERRYS INGENIOUS SPECULATION EXCEEDED EVEN HIS MOST SANGUINE HOPES THE OLDEST INHABITANTS RECOLLECTED NO PERIOD AT WHICH MEASLES HAD BEEN SO PREVALENT OR SO FATAL TO INFANT EXISTENCE AND MANY WERE THE MOURNFUL PROCESSIONS WHICH LITTLE OLIVER HEADED IN A HATBAND REACHING DOWN TO HIS KNEES TO THE INDESCRIBABLE ADMIRATION AND EMOTION OF ALL THE MOTHERS IN THE TOWN AS OLIVER ACCOMPANIED HIS MASTER IN MOST OF HIS ADULT EXPEDITIONS TOO IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT ACQUIRE THAT EQUANIMITY OF DEMEANOUR AND FULL COMMAND OF NERVE WHICH WAS ESSENTIAL TO A FINISHED UNDERTAKER HE HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES OF OBSERVING THE BEAUTIFUL RESIGNATION AND FORTITUDE WITH WHICH SOME STRONGMINDED PEOPLE BEAR THEIR TRIALS AND LOSSES FOR INSTANCE WHEN SOWERBERRY HAD AN ORDER FOR THE BURIAL OF SOME RICH OLD LADY OR GENTLEMAN WHO WAS SURROUNDED BY A GREAT NUMBER OF NEPHEWS AND NIECES WHO HAD BEEN PERFECTLY INCONSOLABLE DURING THE PREVIOUS ILLNESS AND WHOSE GRIEF HAD BEEN WHOLLY IRREPRESSIBLE EVEN ON THE MOST PUBLIC OCCASIONS THEY WOULD BE AS HAPPY AMONG THEMSELVES AS NEED BEQUITE CHEERFUL AND CONTENTEDCONVERSING TOGETHER WITH AS MUCH FREEDOM AND GAIETY AS IF NOTHING WHATEVER HAD HAPPENED TO DISTURB THEM HUSBANDS TOO BORE THE LOSS OF THEIR WIVES WITH THE MOST HEROIC CALMNESS WIVES AGAIN PUT ON WEEDS FOR THEIR HUSBANDS AS IF SO FAR FROM GRIEVING IN THE GARB OF SORROW THEY HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO RENDER IT AS BECOMING AND ATTRACTIVE AS POSSIBLE IT WAS OBSERVABLE TOO THAT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHO WERE IN PASSIONS OF ANGUISH DURING THE CEREMONY OF INTERMENT RECOVERED ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY REACHED HOME AND BECAME QUITE COMPOSED BEFORE THE TEADRINKING WAS OVER ALL THIS WAS VERY PLEASANT AND IMPROVING TO SEE AND OLIVER BEHELD IT WITH GREAT ADMIRATION THAT OLIVER TWIST WAS MOVED TO RESIGNATION BY THE EXAMPLE OF THESE GOOD PEOPLE I CANNOT ALTHOUGH I AM HIS BIOGRAPHER UNDERTAKE TO AFFIRM WITH ANY DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE BUT I CAN MOST DISTINCTLY SAY THAT FOR MANY MONTHS HE CONTINUED MEEKLY TO SUBMIT TO THE DOMINATION AND ILLTREATMENT OF NOAH CLAYPOLE WHO USED HIM FAR WORSE THAN BEFORE NOW THAT HIS JEALOUSY WAS ROUSED BY SEEING THE NEW BOY PROMOTED TO THE BLACK STICK AND HATBAND WHILE HE THE OLD ONE REMAINED STATIONARY IN THE MUFFINCAP AND LEATHERS CHARLOTTE TREATED HIM ILL BECAUSE NOAH DID AND MRS SOWERBERRY WAS HIS DECIDED ENEMY BECAUSE MR SOWERBERRY WAS DISPOSED TO BE HIS FRIEND SO BETWEEN THESE THREE ON ONE SIDE AND A GLUT OF FUNERALS ON THE OTHER OLIVER WAS NOT ALTOGETHER AS COMFORTABLE AS THE HUNGRY PIG WAS WHEN HE WAS SHUT UP BY MISTAKE IN THE GRAIN DEPARTMENT OF A BREWERY AND NOW I COME TO A VERY IMPORTANT PASSAGE IN OLIVERS HISTORY FOR I HAVE TO RECORD AN ACT SLIGHT AND UNIMPORTANT PERHAPS IN APPEARANCE BUT WHICH INDIRECTLY PRODUCED A MATERIAL CHANGE IN ALL HIS FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROCEEDINGS ONE DAY OLIVER AND NOAH HAD DESCENDED INTO THE KITCHEN AT THE USUAL DINNERHOUR TO BANQUET UPON A SMALL JOINT OF MUTTONA POUND AND A HALF OF THE WORST END OF THE NECKWHEN CHARLOTTE BEING CALLED OUT OF THE WAY THERE ENSUED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF TIME WHICH NOAH CLAYPOLE BEING HUNGRY AND VICIOUS CONSIDERED HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY DEVOTE TO A WORTHIER PURPOSE THAN AGGRAVATING AND TANTALISING YOUNG OLIVER TWIST INTENT UPON THIS INNOCENT AMUSEMENT NOAH PUT HIS FEET ON THE TABLECLOTH AND PULLED OLIVERS HAIR AND TWITCHED HIS EARS AND EXPRESSED HIS OPINION THAT HE WAS A SNEAK AND FURTHERMORE ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF COMING TO SEE HIM HANGED WHENEVER THAT DESIRABLE EVENT SHOULD TAKE PLACE AND ENTERED UPON VARIOUS TOPICS OF PETTY ANNOYANCE LIKE A MALICIOUS AND ILLCONDITIONED CHARITYBOY AS HE WAS BUT MAKING OLIVER CRY NOAH ATTEMPTED TO BE MORE FACETIOUS STILL AND IN HIS ATTEMPT DID WHAT MANY SOMETIMES DO TO THIS DAY WHEN THEY WANT TO BE FUNNY HE GOT RATHER PERSONAL WORKUS SAID NOAH HOWS YOUR MOTHER SHES DEAD REPLIED OLIVER DONT YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HER TO ME OLIVERS COLOUR ROSE AS HE SAID THIS HE BREATHED QUICKLY AND THERE WAS A CURIOUS WORKING OF THE MOUTH AND NOSTRILS WHICH MR CLAYPOLE THOUGHT MUST BE THE IMMEDIATE PRECURSOR OF A VIOLENT FIT OF CRYING UNDER THIS IMPRESSION HE RETURNED TO THE CHARGE WHAT DID SHE DIE OF WORKUS SAID NOAH OF A BROKEN HEART SOME OF OUR OLD NURSES TOLD ME REPLIED OLIVER MORE AS IF HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF THAN ANSWERING NOAH I THINK I KNOW WHAT IT MUST BE TO DIE OF THAT TOL DE ROL LOL LOL RIGHT

THROAT SHOOK HIM IN THE VIOLENCE OF HIS RAGE TILL HIS TEETH CHATTERED IN HIS HEAD AND COLLECTING HIS WHOLE FORCE INTO ONE HEAVY BLOW FELLED HIM TO THE GROUND A MINUTE AGO THE BOY HAD LOOKED THE QUIET CHILD MILD DEJECTED CREATURE THAT HARSH TREATMENT HAD MADE HIM BUT HIS SPIRIT WAS ROUSED AT LAST THE CRUEL INSULT TO HIS DEAD MOTHER HAD SET HIS BLOOD ON FIRE HIS BREAST HEAVED HIS ATTITUDE WAS ERECT HIS EYE BRIGHT AND VIVID HIS WHOLE PERSON CHANGED AS HE STOOD GLARING OVER THE COWARDLY TORMENTOR WHO NOW LAY CROUCHING AT HIS FEET AND DEFIED HIM WITH AN ENERGY HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE HELL MURDER ME BLUBBERED NOAH CHARLOTTE MISSIS HERES THE NEW BOY A MURDERING OF ME HELP HELP OLIVERS GONE MAD CHARLOTTE NOAHS SHOUTS WERE RESPONDED TO BY A LOUD SCREAM FROM CHARLOTTE AND A LOUDER FROM MRS SOWERBERRY THE FORMER OF WHOM RUSHED INTO THE KITCHEN BY A SIDEDOOR WHILE THE LATTER PAUSED ON THE STAIRCASE TILL SHE WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESERVATION OF HUMAN LIFE TO COME FURTHER DOWN OH YOU LITTLE WRETCH SCREAMED CHARLOTTE SEIZING OLIVER WITH HER UTMOST FORCE WHICH WAS ABOUT EQUAL TO THAT OF A MODERATELY STRONG MAN IN PARTICULARLY GOOD TRAINING OH YOU LITTLE UNGRATEFUL MURDEROUS HORRID VILLAIN AND BETWEEN EVERY SYLLABLE CHARLOTTE GAVE OLIVER A BLOW WITH ALL HER MIGHT ACCOMPANYING IT WITH A SCREAM FOR THE BENEFIT OF SOCIETY CHARLOTTES FIST WAS BY NO MEANS A LIGHT ONE BUT LEST IT SHOULD NOT BE EFFECTUAL IN CALMING OLIVERS WRATH MRS SOWERBERRY PLUNGED INTO THE KITCHEN AND ASSISTED TO HOLD HIM WITH ONE HAND WHILE SHE SCRATCHED HIS FACE WITH THE OTHER IN THIS FAVOURABLE POSITION OF AFFAIRS NOAH ROSE FROM THE GROUND AND POMMELLED HIM BEHIND THIS WAS RATHER TOO VIOLENT EXERCISE TO LAST LONG WHEN THEY WERE ALL WEARIED OUT AND COULD TEAR AND BEAT NO

ALL PRECEDENTS IN DISPUTES OF MATRIMONY ESTABLISHED A BRUTE AN UNNATURAL HUSBAND AN INSULTING CREATURE A BASE IMITATION OF A MAN AND VARIOUS OTHER AGREEABLE CHARACTERS TOO NUMEROUS FOR RECITAL WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS CHAPTER TO DO HIM JUSTICE HE WAS AS FAR AS HIS POWER WENTIT WAS NOT VERY EXTENSIVEKINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS THE BOY PERHAPS BECAUSE IT WAS HIS INTEREST TO BE SO PERHAPS BECAUSE HIS WIFE DISLIKED HIM THE FLOOD OF TEARS HOWEVER LEFT HIM NO RESOURCE SO HE AT ONCE GAVE HIM A DRUBBING WHICH SATISFIED EVEN MRS SOWERBERRY HERSELF AND RENDERED MR BUMBLES SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION OF THE PAROCHIAL CANE RATHER UNNECESSARY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY HE WAS SHUT UP IN THE BACK KITCHEN IN COMPANY WITH A PUMP AND A SLICE OF BREAD AND AT NIGHT MRS SOWERBERRY AFTER MAKING VARIOUS REMARKS OUTSIDE THE DOOR BY NO MEANS COMPLIMENTARY TO THE MEMORY OF HIS MOTHER LOOKED INTO THE ROOM AND AMIDST THE JEERS AND POINTINGS OF NOAH AND CHARLOTTE ORDERED HIM UPSTAIRS TO HIS DISMAL BED IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SILENCE AND STILLNESS OF THE GLOOMY WORKSHOP OF THE UNDERTAKER THAT OLIVER GAVE WAY TO THE FEELINGS WHICH THE DAYS TREATMENT MAY BE SUPPOSED LIKELY TO HAVE AWAKENED IN A MERE CHILD HE HAD LISTENED TO THEIR TAUNTS WITH A LOOK OF CONTEMPT HE HAD BORNE THE LASH WITHOUT A CRY FOR HE FELT THAT PRIDE SWELLING IN HIS HEART WHICH WOULD HAVE KEPT DOWN A SHRIEK TO THE LAST THOUGH THEY HAD ROASTED HIM ALIVE BUT NOW WHEN THERE WERE NONE TO SEE OR HEAR HIM HE FELL UPON HIS KNEES ON THE FLOOR AND HIDING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS WEPT SUCH TEARS AS GOD SEND FOR THE CREDIT OF OUR NATURE FEW SO YOUNG MAY EVER HAVE CAUSE TO POUR OUT BEFORE HIM FOR A LONG TIME OLIVER REMAINED MOTIONLESS IN THIS ATTITUDE THE CANDLE WAS BURNING LOW IN THE SOCKET WHEN HE ROSE TO HIS FEET HAVING GAZED CAUTIOUSLY ROUND HIM AND LISTENED INTENTLY HE GENTLY UNDID THE FASTENINGS OF THE DOOR AND LOOKED ABROAD IT WAS A COLD DARK NIGHT THE STARS SEEMED TO THE BOYS EYES FARTHER FROM THE EARTH THAN HE HAD EVER SEEN THEM BEFORE THERE WAS NO WIND AND THE SOMBRE SHADOWS THROWN BY THE TREES UPON THE GROUND LOOKED SEPULCHRAL AND DEATHLIKE FROM BEING SO STILL HE SOFTLY RECLOSED THE DOOR HAVING AVAILED HIMSELF OF THE EXPIRING LIGHT OF THE CANDLE TO TIE UP IN A HANDKERCHIEF THE FEW ARTICLES OF WEARING APPAREL HE HAD SAT HIMSELF DOWN UPON A BENCH TO WAIT FOR MORNING WITH THE FIRST RAY OF LIGHT THAT STRUGGLED THROUGH THE CREVICES IN THE SHUTTERS OLIVER AROSE AND AGAIN UNBARRED THE DOOR ONE TIMID LOOK AROUNDONE MOMENTS PAUSE OF HESITATIONHE HAD CLOSED IT BEHIND HIM AND WAS IN THE OPEN STREET HE LOOKED TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE LEFT UNCERTAIN WHITHER TO FLY HE REMEMBERED TO HAVE SEEN THE WAGGONS AS THEY WENT OUT TOILING UP THE HILL HE TOOK THE SAME ROUTE AND ARRIVING AT A FOOTPATH ACROSS THE FIELDS WHICH HE KNEW AFTER SOME DISTANCE LED OUT AGAIN INTO THE ROAD STRUCK INTO IT AND WALKED QUICKLY ON ALONG THIS SAME FOOTPATH OLIVER WELLREMEMBERED HE HAD TROTTED BESIDE MR BUMBLE WHEN HE FIRST CARRIED HIM TO THE WORKHOUSE FROM THE FARM HIS WAY LAY DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE COTTAGE HIS HEART BEAT QUICKLY WHEN HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF THIS AND HE HALF RESOLVED TO TURN BACK HE HAD COME A LONG WAY THOUGH AND SHOULD LOSE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME BY DOING SO BESIDES IT WAS SO EARLY THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FEAR OF HIS BEING SEEN SO HE WALKED ON HE REACHED THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF ITS INMATES STIRRING AT THAT EARLY HOUR OLIVER STOPPED AND PEEPED INTO THE GARDEN A CHILD WAS WEEDING ONE OF THE LITTLE BEDS AS HE STOPPED HE RAISED HIS PALE FACE AND DISCLOSED THE FEATURES OF ONE OF HIS FORMER COMPANIONS OLIVER FELT GLAD TO SEE HIM BEFORE HE WENT FOR THOUGH YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF HE HAD BEEN HIS LITTLE FRIEND AND PLAYMATE THEY HAD BEEN BEATEN AND STARVED AND SHUT UP TOGETHER MANY AND MANY A TIME HUSH DICK SAID OLIVER AS THE BOY RAN TO THE GATE AND THRUST HIS THIN ARM BETWEEN THE RAILS TO GREET HIM IS ANY ONE UP NOBODY BUT ME REPLIED THE CHILD YOU MUSNT SAY YOU SAW ME DICK SAID OLIVER I AM RUNNING AWAY THEY BEAT AND ILLUSE ME DICK AND I AM GOING TO SEEK MY FORTUNE SOME LONG WAY OFF I DONT KNOW WHERE HOW PALE YOU ARE I HEARD THE DOCTOR TELL THEM I WAS DYING REPLIED THE CHILD

HOPE SO REPLIED THE CHILD AFTER I AM DEAD BUT NOT BEFORE I KNOW THE DOCTOR MUST BE RIGHT OLIVER BECAUSE I DREAM SO MUCH OF HEAVEN AND ANGELS AND KIND FACES THAT I NEVER SEE WHEN I AM AWAKE KISS ME SAID THE CHILD CLIMBING UP THE LOW GATE AND FLINGING HIS LITTLE ARMS ROUND OLIVERS NECK GOODBYE DEAR GOD BLESS YOU THE BLESSING WAS FROM A YOUNG CHILDS LIPS BUT IT WAS THE FIRST THAT OLIVER HAD EVER HEARD INVOKED UPON HIS HEAD AND THROUGH THE STRUGGLES AND SUFFERINGS AND TROUBLES AND CHANGES OF HIS AFTER LIFE HE NEVER ONCE FORGOT IT CHAPTER VIII OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN OLIVER REACHED THE STILE AT WHICH THE BYPATH TERMINATED AND ONCE MORE GAINED THE HIGHROAD IT WAS EIGHT OCLOCK NOW THOUGH HE WAS NEARLY FIVE MILES AWAY FROM THE TOWN HE RAN AND HID BEHIND THE HEDGES BY TURNS TILL NOON FEARING THAT HE MIGHT BE PURSUED AND OVERTAKEN THEN HE SAT DOWN TO REST BY THE SIDE OF THE MILESTONE AND BEGAN TO THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME WHERE HE HAD BETTER GO AND TRY TO LIVE THE STONE BY WHICH HE WAS SEATED BORE IN LARGE CHARACTERS AN INTIMATION THAT IT WAS JUST SEVENTY MILES FROM THAT SPOT TO LONDON THE NAME AWAKENED A NEW TRAIN OF IDEAS IN THE BOYS MIND LONDONTHAT GREAT PLACENOBODYNOT EVEN MR BUMBLECOULD EVER FIND HIM THERE HE HAD OFTEN HEARD THE OLD MEN IN THE WORKHOUSE TOO SAY THAT NO LAD OF SPIRIT NEED WANT IN LONDON AND THAT THERE WERE WAYS OF LIVING IN THAT VAST CITY WHICH THOSE WHO HAD BEEN BRED UP IN COUNTRY PARTS HAD NO IDEA OF IT WAS THE VERY PLACE FOR A HOMELESS BOY WHO MUST DIE IN THE STREETS UNLESS SOME ONE HELPED HIM AS THESE THINGS PASSED THROUGH HIS THOUGHTS HE JUMPED UPON HIS FEET AND AGAIN WALKED FORWARD HE HAD DIMINISHED THE DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND LONDON BY FULL FOUR MILES MORE BEFORE HE RECOLLECTED HOW MUCH HE MUST UNDERGO ERE HE COULD HOPE TO REACH HIS PLACE OF DESTINATION AS THIS CONSIDERATION FORCED ITSELF UPON HIM HE SLACKENED HIS PACE A LITTLE AND MEDITATED UPON HIS MEANS OF GETTING THERE HE HAD A CRUST OF BREAD A COARSE SHIRT AND TWO PAIRS OF STOCKINGS IN HIS BUNDLE HE HAD A PENNY TOOA GIFT OF SOWERBERRYS AFTER SOME FUNERAL IN WHICH HE HAD ACQUITTED HIMSELF MORE THAN ORDINARILY WELLIN HIS POCKET A CLEAN SHIRT THOUGHT OLIVER IS A VERY COMFORTABLE THING AND SO ARE TWO PAIRS OF DARNED STOCKINGS AND SO IS A PENNY BUT THEY ARE SMALL HELPS TO A SIXTYFIVE MILES WALK IN WINTER TIME BUT OLIVERS THOUGHTS LIKE THOSE OF MOST OTHER PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE EXTREMELY READY AND ACTIVE TO POINT OUT HIS DIFFICULTIES WERE WHOLLY AT A LOSS TO SUGGEST ANY FEASIBLE MODE OF SURMOUNTING THEM SO AFTER A GOOD DEAL OF THINKING TO NO PARTICULAR PURPOSE HE CHANGED HIS LITTLE BUNDLE OVER TO THE OTHER SHOULDER AND TRUDGED ON OLIVER WALKED TWENTY MILES THAT DAY AND ALL THAT TIME TASTED NOTHING BUT THE CRUST OF DRY BREAD AND A FEW DRAUGHTS OF WATER WHICH HE BEGGED AT THE COTTAGEDOORS BY THE ROADSIDE WHEN THE NIGHT CAME HE TURNED INTO A MEADOW AND CREEPING CLOSE UNDER A HAYRICK DETERMINED TO LIE THERE TILL MORNING HE FELT FRIGHTENED AT FIRST FOR THE WIND MOANED DISMALLY OVER THE EMPTY FIELDS AND HE WAS COLD AND HUNGRY AND MORE ALONE THAN HE HAD EVER FELT BEFORE BEING VERY TIRED WITH HIS WALK HOWEVER HE SOON FELL ASLEEP AND FORGOT HIS TROUBLES HE FELT COLD AND STIFF WHEN HE GOT UP NEXT MORNING AND SO HUNGRY THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO EXCHANGE THE PENNY FOR A SMALL LOAF IN THE VERY FIRST VILLAGE THROUGH WHICH HE PASSED HE HAD WALKED NO MORE THAN TWELVE MILES WHEN NIGHT CLOSED IN AGAIN HIS FEET WERE SORE AND HIS LEGS SO WEAK THAT THEY TREMBLED BENEATH HIM ANOTHER NIGHT PASSED IN THE BLEAK DAMP AIR MADE HIM WORSE WHEN HE SET FORWARD ON HIS JOURNEY NEXT MORNING HE COULD HARDLY CRAWL ALONG HE WAITED AT THE BOTTOM OF A STEEP HILL TILL A STAGECOACH CAME UP AND THEN BEGGED OF THE OUTSIDE PASSENGERS BUT THERE WERE VERY FEW WHO TOOK ANY NOTICE OF HIM AND EVEN THOSE TOLD HIM TO WAIT TILL THEY GOT TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AND THEN LET THEM SEE HOW FAR HE COULD RUN FOR A HALFPENNY POOR OLIVER TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH THE COACH A LITTLE WAY BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO IT BY REASON OF HIS FATIGUE AND SORE FEET WHEN THE OUTSIDES SAW THIS THEY PUT THEIR HALFPENCE BACK INTO THEIR POCKETS AGAIN DECLARING THAT HE WAS AN IDLE YOUNG DOG AND DIDNT DESERVE ANYTHING AND THE COACH RATTLED AWAY AND LEFT ONLY A CLOUD OF DUST BEHIND IN SOME VILLAGES LARGE PAINTED BOARDS WERE FIXED UP WARNING ALL PERSONS WHO BEGGED WITHIN THE DISTRICT THAT THEY WOULD BE SENT TO JAIL THIS FRIGHTENED OLIVER VERY MUCH AND MADE HIM GLAD TO GET OUT OF THOSE VILLAGES WITH ALL POSSIBLE EXPEDITION IN OTHERS HE WOULD STAND ABOUT THE INNYARDS AND LOOK MOURNFULLY AT EVERY ONE WHO PASSED A PROCEEDING WHICH GENERALLY TERMINATED IN THE LANDLADYS ORDERING ONE OF THE POSTBOYS WHO WERE LOUNGING ABOUT TO DRIVE THAT STRANGE BOY OUT OF THE PLACE FOR SHE WAS SURE HE HAD COME TO STEAL SOMETHING IF HE BEGGED AT A FARMERS HOUSE TEN TO ONE BUT THEY THREATENED TO SET THE DOG ON HIM AND WHEN HE SHOWED HIS NOSE IN A SHOP THEY TALKED ABOUT THE BEADLEWHICH BROUGHT OLIVERS HEART INTO HIS MOUTHVERY OFTEN THE ONLY THING HE HAD THERE FOR MANY HOURS TOGETHER IN FACT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR A GOODHEARTED TURNPIKEMAN AND A BENEVOLENT OLD LADY OLIVERS TROUBLES WOULD HAVE BEEN SHORTENED BY THE VERY SAME PROCESS WHICH HAD PUT AN END TO HIS MOTHERS IN OTHER WORDS HE WOULD MOST ASSUREDLY HAVE FALLEN DEAD UPON THE KINGS HIGHWAY BUT THE TURNPIKEMAN GAVE HIM A MEAL OF BREAD AND CHEESE AND THE OLD LADY WHO HAD A SHIPWRECKED GRANDSON WANDERING BAREFOOT IN SOME DISTANT PART OF THE EARTH TOOK PITY UPON THE POOR ORPHAN AND GAVE HIM WHAT LITTLE SHE COULD AFFORDAND MOREWITH SUCH KIND AND GENTLE WORDS AND SUCH TEARS OF SYMPATHY AND COMPASSION THAT THEY SANK DEEPER INTO OLIVERS SOUL THAN ALL THE SUFFERINGS HE HAD EVER UNDERGONE EARLY ON THE SEVENTH MORNING AFTER HE HAD LEFT HIS NATIVE PLACE OLIVER LIMPED SLOWLY INTO THE LITTLE TOWN OF BARNET THE WINDOWSHUTTERS WERE CLOSED THE STREET WAS EMPTY NOT A SOUL HAD AWAKENED TO THE BUSINESS OF THE DAY THE SUN WAS RISING IN ALL ITS SPLENDID BEAUTY BUT THE LIGHT ONLY SERVED TO SHOW THE BOY HIS OWN LONESOMENESS AND DESOLATION AS HE SAT WITH BLEEDING FEET AND COVERED WITH DUST UPON A DOORSTEP BY DEGREES THE SHUTTERS WERE OPENED THE WINDOWBLINDS WERE DRAWN UP AND PEOPLE BEGAN PASSING TO AND FRO SOME FEW STOPPED TO GAZE AT OLIVER FOR A MOMENT OR TWO OR TURNED ROUND TO STARE AT HIM AS THEY HURRIED BY BUT NONE RELIEVED HIM OR TROUBLED THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE HOW HE CAME THERE HE HAD NO HEART TO BEG AND THERE HE SAT HE HAD BEEN CROUCHING ON THE STEP FOR SOME TIME WONDERING AT THE GREAT NUMBER OF PUBLICHOUSES EVERY OTHER HOUSE IN BARNET WAS A TAVERN LARGE OR SMALL GAZING LISTLESSLY AT THE COACHES AS THEY PASSED THROUGH AND THINKING HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED THAT THEY COULD DO WITH EASE IN A FEW HOURS WHAT IT HAD TAKEN HIM A WHOLE WEEK OF COURAGE AND DETERMINATION BEYOND HIS YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN HE WAS ROUSED BY OBSERVING THAT A BOY WHO HAD PASSED HIM CARELESSLY SOME MINUTES BEFORE HAD RETURNED AND WAS NOW SURVEYING HIM MOST EARNESTLY FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY HE TOOK LITTLE HEED OF THIS AT FIRST BUT THE BOY REMAINED IN THE SAME ATTITUDE OF CLOSE OBSERVATION SO LONG THAT OLIVER RAISED HIS HEAD AND RETURNED HIS STEADY LOOK UPON THIS THE BOY CROSSED OVER AND WALKING CLOSE UP TO OLIVER SAID HULLO MY COVEY WHATS THE ROW THE BOY WHO ADDRESSED THIS INQUIRY TO THE YOUNG WAYFARER WAS ABOUT HIS OWN AGE BUT ONE OF THE QUEEREST LOOKING BOYS THAT OLIVER HAD EVEN SEEN HE WAS A SNUBNOSED FLATBROWED COMMONFACED BOY ENOUGH AND AS DIRTY A JUVENILE AS ONE WOULD WISH TO SEE BUT HE HAD ABOUT HIM ALL THE AIRS AND MANNERS OF A MAN HE WAS SHORT OF HIS AGE WITH RATHER BOWLEGS AND LITTLE SHARP UGLY EYES HIS HAT WAS STUCK ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD SO LIGHTLY THAT IT THREATENED TO FALL OFF EVERY MOMENTAND WOULD HAVE DONE SO VERY OFTEN IF THE WEARER HAD NOT HAD A KNACK OF EVERY NOW AND THEN GIVING HIS HEAD A SUDDEN TWITCH WHICH BROUGHT IT BACK TO ITS OLD PLACE AGAIN HE WORE A MANS COAT WHICH REACHED NEARLY TO HIS HEELS HE HAD TURNED THE CUFFS BACK HALFWAY UP HIS ARM TO GET HIS HANDS OUT OF THE SLEEVES APPARENTLY WITH THE ULTIMATE VIEW OF THRUSTING THEM INTO THE POCKETS OF HIS CORDUROY TROUSERS FOR THERE HE KEPT THEM HE WAS ALTOGETHER AS ROYSTERING AND SWAGGERING A YOUNG GENTLEMAN AS EVER STOOD FOUR FEET SIX OR SOMETHING LESS IN THE BLUCHERS HULLO MY COVEY WHATS THE ROW SAID THIS STRANGE YOUNG GENTLEMAN TO OLIVER I AM VERY HUNGRY AND TIRED REPLIED OLIVER THE TEARS STANDING IN HIS EYES AS HE SPOKE I HAVE WALKED A LONG WAY I HAVE BEEN WALKING THESE SEVEN DAYS WALKING FOR SIVIN DAYS SAID THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN OH I SEE BEAKS ORDER EH BUT HE ADDED NOTICING OLIVERS LOOK OF SURPRISE I SUPPOSE YOU DONT KNOW WHAT A BEAK IS MY FLASH COMPANION OLIVER MILDLY REPLIED THAT HE HAD ALWAYS HEARD A BIRDS MOUTH DESCRIBED BY THE TERM IN QUESTION MY EYES HOW GREEN EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHY A BEAKS A MADGSTRATE AND WHEN YOU WALK BY A

TO AN ADJACENT CHANDLERS SHOP WHERE HE PURCHASED A SUFFICIENCY OF READYDRESSED HAM AND A HALFQUARTERN LOAF OR AS HE HIMSELF EXPRESSED IT A FOURPENNY BRAN THE HAM BEING KEPT CLEAN AND PRESERVED FROM DUST BY THE INGENIOUS EXPEDIENT OF MAKING A HOLE IN THE LOAF BY PULLING OUT A PORTION OF THE CRUMB AND STUFFING IT THEREIN TAKING THE BREAD UNDER HIS ARM THE YOUNG GENTLMAN TURNED INTO A SMALL PUBLICHOUSE AND LED THE WAY TO A TAPROOM IN THE REAR OF THE PREMISES HERE A POT OF BEER WAS BROUGHT IN BY DIRECTION OF THE MYSTERIOUS YOUTH AND OLIVER FALLING TO AT HIS NEW FRIENDS BIDDING MADE A LONG AND HEARTY MEAL DURING THE PROGRESS OF WHICH THE STRANGE BOY EYED HIM FROM TIME TO TIME WITH GREAT ATTENTION GOING TO LONDON SAID THE STRANGE BOY WHEN OLIVER HAD AT LENGTH CONCLUDED YES GOT ANY

INTERDUCES YOU AND DONT HE KNOW ME OH NO NOT IN THE LEAST BY NO MEANS CERTAINLY NOT THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN SMILED AS IF TO INTIMATE THAT THE LATTER FRAGMENTS OF DISCOURSE WERE PLAYFULLY IRONICAL AND FINISHED THE BEER AS HE DID SO THIS UNEXPECTED OFFER OF SHELTER WAS TOO TEMPTING TO BE RESISTED ESPECIALLY AS IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED UP BY THE ASSURANCE THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN REFERRED TO WOULD DOUBTLESS PROVIDE OLIVER WITH A COMFORTABLE PLACE WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME THIS LED TO A MORE FRIENDLY AND CONFIDENTIAL DIALOGUE FROM WHICH OLIVER DISCOVERED THAT HIS FRIENDS NAME WAS JACK DAWKINS AND THAT HE WAS A PECULIAR PET AND PROTEGE OF THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN BEFORE MENTIONED MR DAWKINS APPEARANCE DID NOT SAY A VAST DEAL IN FAVOUR OF THE COMFORTS WHICH HIS PATRONS INTEREST OBTAINED FOR THOSE WHOM HE TOOK UNDER HIS PROTECTION BUT AS HE HAD A RATHER FLIGHTLY AND DISSOLUTE MODE OF CONVERSING AND FURTHERMORE AVOWED THAT AMONG HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS HE WAS BETTER KNOWN BY THE SOBRIQUET OF THE ARTFUL DODGER OLIVER CONCLUDED THAT BEING OF A DISSIPATED AND CARELESS TURN THE MORAL PRECEPTS OF HIS BENEFACTOR HAD HITHERTO BEEN THROWN AWAY UPON HIM UNDER THIS IMPRESSION HE SECRETLY RESOLVED TO CULTIVATE THE GOOD OPINION OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND IF HE FOUND THE DODGER INCORRIGIBLE AS HE MORE THAN HALF SUSPECTED HE SHOULD TO DECLINE THE HONOUR OF HIS FARTHER ACQUAINTANCE AS JOHN DAWKINS OBJECTED TO THEIR ENTERING LONDON BEFORE NIGHTFALL IT WAS NEARLY ELEVEN OCLOCK WHEN THEY REACHED THE TURNPIKE AT ISLINGTON THEY CROSSED FROM THE ANGEL INTO ST JOHNS ROAD

ALTHOUGH OLIVER HAD ENOUGH TO OCCUPY HIS ATTENTION IN KEEPING SIGHT OF HIS LEADER HE COULD NOT HELP BESTOWING A FEW HASTY GLANCES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WAY AS HE PASSED ALONG A DIRTIER OR MORE WRETCHED PLACE HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE STREET WAS VERY NARROW AND MUDDY AND THE AIR WAS IMPREGNATED WITH FILTHY ODOURS THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SMALL SHOPS BUT THE ONLY STOCK IN TRADE APPEARED TO BE HEAPS OF CHILDREN WHO EVEN AT THAT TIME OF NIGHT WERE CRAWLING IN AND OUT AT THE DOORS OR SCREAMING FROM THE INSIDE THE SOLE PLACES THAT SEEMED TO PROSPER AMID THE GENERAL BLIGHT OF THE PLACE WERE THE PUBLICHOUSES AND IN THEM THE LOWEST ORDERS OF IRISH WERE WRANGLING WITH MIGHT AND MAIN COVERED WAYS AND YARDS WHICH HERE AND THERE DIVERGED FROM THE MAIN STREET DISCLOSED LITTLE KNOTS OF HOUSES WHERE DRUNKEN MEN AND WOMEN WERE POSITIVELY WALLOWING IN FILTH AND FROM SEVERAL OF THE DOORWAYS GREAT ILLLOOKING FELLOWS WERE CAUTIOUSLY EMERGING BOUND TO ALL APPEARANCE ON NO VERY WELLDISPOSED OR HARMLESS ERRANDS OLIVER WAS JUST CONSIDERING WHETHER HE HADNT BETTER RUN AWAY WHEN THEY REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL HIS CONDUCTOR CATCHING HIM BY THE ARM PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR OF A HOUSE NEAR FIELD LANE AND DRAWING HIM INTO THE PASSAGE CLOSED IT BEHIND THEM NOW THEN CRIED A VOICE FROM BELOW IN REPLY TO A WHISTLE FROM THE DODGER PLUMMY AND SLAM WAS THE REPLY THIS SEEMED TO BE SOME WATCHWORD OR SIGNAL THAT

OLIVER THATS ALL HA HA HA THE LATTER PART OF THIS SPEECH WAS HAILED BY A BOISTEROUS SHOUT FROM ALL THE HOPEFUL PUPILS OF THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE MIDST OF WHICH THEY WENT TO SUPPER OLIVER ATE HIS SHARE AND THE JEW THEN MIXED HIM A GLASS OF HOT GINANDWATER TELLING HIM HE MUST DRINK IT OFF DIRECTLY BECAUSE ANOTHER GENTLEMAN WANTED THE TUMBLER OLIVER DID AS HE WAS DESIRED IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS HE FELT HIMSELF GENTLY LIFTED ON TO ONE OF THE SACKS AND THEN HE SUNK INTO A DEEP SLEEP CHAPTER IX CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS IT WAS LATE NEXT MORNING WHEN OLIVER AWOKE FROM A SOUND LONG SLEEP THERE WAS NO OTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM BUT THE OLD JEW WHO WAS BOILING SOME COFFEE IN A SAUCEPAN FOR BREAKFAST AND WHISTLING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF AS HE STIRRED IT ROUND AND ROUND WITH AN IRON SPOON HE WOULD STOP EVERY NOW AND THEN TO LISTEN WHEN THERE WAS THE LEAST NOISE BELOW AND WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF HE WOULD GO ON WHISTLING AND STIRRING AGAIN AS BEFORE ALTHOUGH OLIVER HAD ROUSED HIMSELF FROM SLEEP HE WAS NOT THOROUGHLY AWAKE THERE IS A DROWSY STATE BETWEEN SLEEPING AND WAKING WHEN YOU DREAM MORE IN FIVE MINUTES WITH YOUR EYES HALF OPEN AND YOURSELF HALF CONSCIOUS OF EVERYTHING THAT IS PASSING AROUND YOU THAN YOU WOULD IN FIVE NIGHTS WITH YOUR EYES FAST CLOSED AND YOUR SENSES WRAPT IN PERFECT UNCONSCIOUSNESS AT SUCH TIME A MORTAL KNOWS JUST ENOUGH OF WHAT HIS MIND IS DOING TO FORM SOME GLIMMERING CONCEPTION OF ITS MIGHTY POWERS ITS BOUNDING FROM EARTH AND SPURNING TIME AND SPACE WHEN FREED FROM THE RESTRAINT OF ITS CORPOREAL ASSOCIATE OLIVER WAS PRECISELY IN THIS CONDITION HE SAW THE JEW WITH HIS HALFCLOSED EYES HEARD HIS LOW WHISTLING AND RECOGNISED THE SOUND OF THE SPOON GRATING AGAINST THE SAUCEPANS SIDES AND YET THE SELFSAME SENSES WERE MENTALLY ENGAGED AT THE SAME TIME IN BUSY ACTION WITH ALMOST EVERYBODY HE HAD EVER KNOWN WHEN THE COFFEE WAS DONE THE JEW DREW THE SAUCEPAN TO THE HOB STANDING THEN IN AN IRRESOLUTE ATTITUDE FOR A FEW MINUTES AS IF HE DID NOT WELL KNOW HOW TO EMPLOY HIMSELF HE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT OLIVER AND CALLED HIM BY HIS NAME HE DID NOT ANSWER AND WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES ASLEEP AFTER SATISFYING HIMSELF UPON THIS HEAD THE JEW STEPPED GENTLY TO THE DOOR WHICH HE FASTENED HE THEN DREW FORTH AS IT SEEMED TO OLIVER FROM SOME TRAP IN THE FLOOR A SMALL BOX WHICH HE PLACED CAREFULLY ON THE TABLE HIS EYES GLISTENED AS HE RAISED THE LID AND LOOKED IN DRAGGING AN OLD CHAIR TO THE TABLE HE SAT DOWN AND TOOK FROM IT A MAGNIFICENT GOLD WATCH SPARKLING WITH JEWELS AHA SAID THE JEW SHRUGGING UP HIS SHOULDERS AND DISTORTING EVERY FEATURE WITH A HIDEOUS GRIN CLEVER DOGS CLEVER DOGS STAUNCH TO THE LAST NEVER TOLD THE OLD PARSON WHERE THEY WERE NEVER POACHED UPON OLD FAGIN AND WHY SHOULD THEY IT WOULDNT HAVE LOOSENED THE KNOT OR KEPT THE DROP UP A MINUTE LONGER NO NO NO FINE FELLOWS FINE FELLOWS WITH THESE AND OTHER MUTTERED REFLECTIONS OF THE LIKE NATURE THE JEW ONCE MORE DEPOSITED THE WATCH IN ITS PLACE OF SAFETY AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN MORE WERE SEVERALLY DRAWN FORTH FROM THE SAME BOX AND SURVEYED WITH EQUAL PLEASURE BESIDES RINGS BROOCHES BRACELETS AND OTHER ARTICLES OF JEWELLERY OF SUCH MAGNIFICENT MATERIALS AND COSTLY WORKMANSHIP THAT OLIVER HAD NO IDEA EVEN OF THEIR NAMES HAVING REPLACED THESE TRINKETS THE JEW TOOK OUT ANOTHER SO SMALL THAT IT LAY IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME VERY MINUTE INSCRIPTION ON IT FOR THE JEW LAID IT FLAT UPON THE TABLE AND SHADING IT WITH HIS HAND PORED OVER IT LONG AND EARNESTLY AT LENGTH HE PUT IT DOWN AS IF DESPAIRING OF SUCCESS AND LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR MUTTERED WHAT A FINE THING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IS DEAD MEN NEVER REPENT DEAD MEN NEVER BRING AWKWARD STORIES TO LIGHT AH ITS A FINE THING FOR THE TRADE FIVE OF EM STRUNG UP IN A ROW AND NONE LEFT TO PLAY BOOTY OR TURN WHITELIVERED AS THE JEW UTTERED THESE WORDS HIS BRIGHT DARK EYES WHICH HAD BEEN STARING VACANTLY BEFORE HIM FELL ON OLIVERS FACE THE BOYS EYES WERE FIXED ON HIS IN MUTE CURIOUSITY AND ALTHOUGH THE RECOGNITION WAS ONLY FOR AN INSTANTFOR THE BRIEFEST SPACE OF TIME THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE CONCEIVEDIT WAS ENOUGH TO SHOW THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD BEEN OBSERVED HE CLOSED THE LID OF THE BOX WITH A LOUD CRASH AND LAYING HIS HAND ON A BREAD KNIFE WHICH WAS ON THE TABLE STARTED FURIOUSLY UP HE TREMBLED VERY MUCH THOUGH FOR EVEN IN HIS TERROR OLIVER COULD SEE THAT THE KNIFE QUIVERED IN THE AIR WHATS THAT SAID THE JEW WHAT DO YOU WATCH ME FOR WHY ARE YOU AWAKE WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN SPEAK OUT BOY QUICKQUICK FOR YOUR LIFE

JEW ABRUPTLY RESUMING HIS OLD MANNER AND PLAYING WITH THE KNIFE A LITTLE BEFORE HE LAID IT DOWN AS IF TO INDUCE THE BELIEF THAT HE HAD CAUGHT IT UP IN MERE SPORT OF COURSE I KNOW THAT MY DEAR I ONLY TRIED TO FRIGHTEN YOU YOURE A BRAVE BOY HA HA YOURE A BRAVE BOY OLIVER THE JEW RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH A CHUCKLE BUT GLANCED UNEASILY AT THE BOX NOTWITHSTANDING DID YOU SEE ANY OF THESE PRETTY THINGS MY

THE FOLKS CALL ME A MISER MY DEAR ONLY A MISER THATS ALL OLIVER THOUGHT THE OLD GENTLEMAN MUST BE A DECIDED MISER TO LIVE IN SUCH A DIRTY PLACE WITH SO MANY WATCHES BUT THINKING THAT PERHAPS HIS FONDNESS FOR THE DODGER AND THE OTHER BOYS COST HIM A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY HE ONLY CAST A DEFERENTIAL LOOK AT THE JEW AND ASKED IF HE MIGHT GET UP CERTAINLY MY DEAR CERTAINLY REPLIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN STAY THERES A PITCHER OF WATER IN THE CORNER BY THE DOOR BRING IT HERE AND ILL GIVE YOU A BASIN TO WASH IN MY DEAR OLIVER GOT UP WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM AND STOOPED FOR AN INSTANT TO RAISE THE PITCHER WHEN HE TURNED HIS HEAD THE BOX WAS GONE HE HAD SCARCELY WASHED HIMSELF AND MADE EVERYTHING TIDY BY EMPTYING THE BASIN OUT OF THE WINDOW AGREEABLY TO THE JEWS DIRECTIONS WHEN THE DODGER RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A VERY SPRIGHTLY YOUNG FRIEND WHOM OLIVER HAD SEEN SMOKING ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND WHO WAS NOW FORMALLY INTRODUCED TO HIM AS CHARLEY BATES THE FOUR SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST ON THE COFFEE AND SOME HOT ROLLS AND HAM WHICH THE DODGER HAD BROUGHT HOME IN THE CROWN OF HIS HAT WELL SAID THE JEW GLANCING SLYLY AT OLIVER AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE DODGER I HOPE YOUVE BEEN AT WORK THIS

AND NICELY MADE INGENIOUS WORKMAN AINT HE OLIVER VERY INDEED SIR SAID OLIVER AT WHICH MR CHARLES BATES LAUGHED UPROARIOUSLY VERY MUCH TO THE AMAZEMENT OF OLIVER WHO SAW NOTHING TO LAUGH AT IN ANYTHING

SO EXQUISITELY LUDICROUS IN THIS REPLY THAT HE BURST INTO ANOTHER LAUGH WHICH LAUGH MEETING THE COFFEE HE WAS DRINKING AND CARRYING IT DOWN SOME WRONG CHANNEL VERY NEARLY TERMINATED IN HIS PREMATURE SUFFOCATION HE IS SO JOLLY GREEN SAID CHARLEY WHEN HE RECOVERED AS AN APOLOGY TO THE COMPANY FOR HIS UNPOLITE BEHAVIOUR THE DODGER SAID NOTHING BUT HE SMOOTHED OLIVERS HAIR OVER HIS EYES AND SAID HED KNOW BETTER BY AND BY UPON WHICH THE OLD GENTLEMAN OBSERVING OLIVERS COLOUR MOUNTING CHANGED THE SUBJECT BY ASKING WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN MUCH OF A CROWD AT THE EXECUTION THAT MORNING THIS MADE HIM WONDER MORE AND MORE FOR IT WAS PLAIN FROM THE REPLIES OF THE TWO BOYS THAT THEY HAD BOTH BEEN THERE AND OLIVER NATURALLY WONDERED HOW THEY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE FOUND TIME TO BE SO VERY INDUSTRIOUS WHEN THE BREAKFAST WAS CLEARED AWAY THE MERRY OLD GENTLMAN AND THE TWO BOYS PLAYED AT A VERY CURIOUS AND UNCOMMON GAME WHICH WAS PERFORMED IN THIS WAY THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN PLACING A SNUFFBOX IN ONE POCKET OF HIS TROUSERS A NOTECASE IN THE OTHER AND A WATCH IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET WITH A GUARDCHAIN ROUND HIS NECK AND STICKING A MOCK DIAMOND PIN IN HIS SHIRT BUTTONED HIS COAT TIGHT ROUND HIM AND PUTTING HIS SPECTACLECASE AND HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS POCKETS TROTTED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WITH A STICK IN IMITATION OF THE MANNER IN WHICH OLD GENTLEMEN WALK ABOUT THE STREETS ANY HOUR IN THE DAY SOMETIMES HE STOPPED AT THE FIREPLACE AND SOMETIMES AT THE DOOR MAKING BELIEVE THAT HE WAS STARING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT INTO SHOPWINDOWS AT SUCH TIMES HE WOULD LOOK CONSTANTLY ROUND HIM FOR FEAR OF THIEVES AND WOULD KEEP SLAPPING ALL HIS POCKETS IN TURN TO SEE THAT HE HADNT LOST ANYTHING IN SUCH A VERY FUNNY AND NATURAL MANNER THAT OLIVER LAUGHED TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS FACE ALL THIS TIME THE TWO BOYS FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT GETTING OUT OF HIS SIGHT SO NIMBLY EVERY TIME HE TURNED ROUND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW THEIR MOTIONS AT LAST THE DODGER TROD UPON HIS TOES OR RAN UPON HIS BOOT ACCIDENTLY WHILE CHARLEY BATES STUMBLED UP AGAINST HIM BEHIND AND IN THAT ONE MOMENT THEY TOOK FROM HIM WITH THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY SNUFFBOX NOTECASE WATCHGUARD CHAIN SHIRTPIN POCKETHANDKERCHIEF EVEN THE SPECTACLECASE IF THE OLD GENTLMAN FELT A HAND IN ANY ONE OF HIS POCKETS HE CRIED OUT WHERE IT WAS AND THEN THE GAME BEGAN ALL OVER AGAIN WHEN THIS GAME HAD BEEN PLAYED A GREAT MANY TIMES A COUPLE OF YOUNG LADIES CALLED TO SEE THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN ONE OF WHOM WAS NAMED BET AND THE OTHER NANCY THEY WORE A GOOD DEAL OF HAIR NOT VERY NEATLY TURNED UP BEHIND AND WERE RATHER UNTIDY ABOUT THE SHOES AND STOCKINGS THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY PRETTY PERHAPS BUT THEY HAD A GREAT DEAL OF COLOUR IN THEIR FACES AND LOOKED QUITE STOUT AND HEARTY BEING REMARKABLY FREE AND AGREEABLE IN THEIR MANNERS OLIVER THOUGHT THEM VERY NICE GIRLS INDEED AS THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WERE THE VISITORS STOPPED A LONG TIME SPIRITS WERE PRODUCED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ONE OF THE YOUNG LADIES COMPLAINING OF A COLDNESS IN HER INSIDE AND THE CONVERSATION TOOK A VERY CONVIVIAL AND IMPROVING TURN AT LENGTH CHARLEY BATES EXPRESSED HIS OPINION THAT IT WAS TIME TO PAD THE HOOF THIS IT OCCURRED TO OLIVER MUST BE FRENCH FOR GOING OUT FOR DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS THE DODGER AND CHARLEY AND THE TWO YOUNG LADIES WENT AWAY TOGETHER HAVING BEEN KINDLY FURNISHED BY THE AMIABLE OLD JEW WITH MONEY TO SPEND THERE MY DEAR SAID FAGIN THATS A PLEASANT LIFE ISNT IT THEY HAVE GONE OUT FOR THE DAY HAVE THEY DONE WORK SIR INQUIRED OLIVER YES SAID THE JEW THAT IS UNLESS THEY SHOULD UNEXPECTEDLY COME ACROSS ANY WHEN THEY ARE OUT AND THEY WONT NEGLECT IT IF THEY DO MY DEAR DEPEND UPON IT MAKE EM YOUR MODELS MY DEAR MAKE EM YOUR MODELS TAPPING THE FIRESHOVEL ON THE HEARTH TO ADD FORCE TO HIS WORDS DO EVERYTHING THEY BID YOU AND TAKE THEIR ADVICE IN ALL MATTERSESPECIALLY THE DODGERS MY DEAR HELL BE A GREAT MAN HIMSELF AND WILL MAKE YOU ONE TOO IF YOU TAKE PATTERN BY HIMIS MY HANDKERCHIEF HANGING OUT OF MY POCKET MY DEAR SAID THE JEW STOPPING SHORT YES SIR SAID OLIVER SEE IF YOU CAN TAKE IT OUT WITHOUT MY FEELING IT AS YOU SAW THEM DO WHEN WE WERE AT PLAY THIS MORNING OLIVER HELD UP THE BOTTOM OF THE POCKET WITH ONE HAND AS HE HAD SEEN THE DODGER HOLD IT AND DREW THE HANDKERCHIEF LIGHTLY OUT OF IT WITH THE OTHER IS IT GONE CRIED THE JEW HERE IT IS SIR SAID OLIVER SHOWING IT IN HIS HAND YOURE A CLEVER BOY MY DEAR SAID THE PLAYFUL OLD GENTLEMAN PATTING OLIVER ON THE HEAD APPROVINGLY I NEVER SAW A SHARPER LAD HERES A SHILLING FOR YOU IF YOU GO ON IN THIS WAY YOULL BE THE GREATEST MAN OF THE TIME AND NOW COME HERE AND ILL SHOW YOU HOW TO TAKE THE MARKS OUT OF THE HANDKERCHIEFS OLIVER WONDERED WHAT PICKING THE OLD GENTLEMANS POCKET IN PLAY HAD TO DO WITH HIS CHANCES OF BEING A GREAT MAN BUT THINKING THAT THE JEW BEING SO MUCH HIS SENIOR MUST KNOW BEST HE FOLLOWED HIM QUIETLY TO THE TABLE AND WAS SOON DEEPLY INVOLVED IN HIS NEW STUDY CHAPTER X OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE BEING A SHORT BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER IN THIS HISTORY FOR MANY DAYS OLIVER REMAINED IN THE JEWS ROOM PICKING THE MARKS OUT OF THE POCKETHANDKERCHIEF OF WHICH A GREAT NUMBER WERE BROUGHT HOME AND SOMETIMES TAKING PART IN THE GAME ALREADY DESCRIBED WHICH THE TWO BOYS AND THE JEW PLAYED REGULARLY EVERY MORNING AT LENGTH HE BEGAN TO LANGUISH FOR FRESH AIR AND TOOK MANY OCCASIONS OF EARNESTLY ENTREATING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO ALLOW HIM TO GO OUT TO WORK WITH HIS TWO COMPANIONS OLIVER WAS RENDERED THE MORE ANXIOUS TO BE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED BY WHAT HE HAD SEEN OF THE STERN MORALITY OF THE OLD GENTLEMANS CHARACTER WHENEVER THE DODGER OR CHARLEY BATES CAME HOME AT NIGHT EMPTYHANDED HE WOULD EXPATIATE WITH GREAT VEHEMENCE ON THE MISERY OF IDLE AND LAZY HABITS AND WOULD ENFORCE UPON THEM THE NECESSITY OF AN ACTIVE LIFE BY SENDING THEM SUPPERLESS TO BED ON ONE OCCASION INDEED HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO KNOCK THEM BOTH DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS BUT THIS WAS CARRYING OUT HIS VIRTUOUS PRECEPTS TO AN UNUSUAL EXTENT AT LENGTH ONE MORNING OLIVER OBTAINED THE PERMISSION HE HAD SO EAGERLY SOUGHT THERE HAD BEEN NO HANDKERCHIEFS TO WORK UPON FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND THE DINNERS HAD BEEN RATHER MEAGRE PERHAPS THESE WERE REASONS FOR THE OLD GENTLEMANS GIVING HIS ASSENT BUT WHETHER THEY WERE OR NO HE TOLD OLIVER HE MIGHT GO AND PLACED HIM UNDER THE JOINT GUARDIANSHIP OF CHARLEY BATES AND HIS FRIEND THE DODGER THE THREE BOYS SALLIED OUT THE DODGER WITH HIS COATSLEEVES TUCKED UP AND HIS HAT COCKED AS USUAL MASTER BATES SAUNTERING ALONG WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND OLIVER BETWEEN THEM WONDERING WHERE THEY WERE GOING AND WHAT BRANCH OF MANUFACTURE HE WOULD BE INSTRUCTED IN FIRST THE PACE AT WHICH THEY WENT WAS SUCH A VERY LAZY ILLLOOKING SAUNTER THAT OLIVER SOON BEGAN TO THINK HIS COMPANIONS WERE GOING TO DECEIVE THE OLD GENTLEMAN BY NOT GOING TO WORK AT ALL THE DODGER HAD A VICIOUS PROPENSITY TOO OF PULLING THE CAPS FROM THE HEADS OF SMALL BOYS AND TOSSING THEM DOWN AREAS WHILE CHARLEY BATES EXHIBITED SOME VERY LOOSE NOTIONS CONCERNING THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY BY PILFERING DIVERS APPLES AND ONIONS FROM THE STALLS AT THE KENNEL SIDES AND THRUSTING THEM INTO POCKETS WHICH WERE SO SURPRISINGLY CAPACIOUS THAT THEY SEEMED TO UNDERMINE HIS WHOLE SUIT OF CLOTHES IN EVERY DIRECTION THESE THINGS LOOKED SO BAD THAT OLIVER WAS ON THE POINT OF DECLARING HIS INTENTION OF SEEKING HIS WAY BACK IN THE BEST WAY HE COULD WHEN HIS THOUGHTS WERE SUDDENLY DIRECTED INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL BY A VERY MYSTERIOUS CHANGE OF BEHAVIOUR ON THE PART OF THE DODGER THEY WERE JUST EMERGING FROM A NARROW COURT NOT FAR FROM THE OPEN SQUARE IN CLERKENWELL WHICH IS YET CALLED BY SOME STRANGE PERVERSION OF TERMS THE GREEN WHEN THE DODGER MADE A SUDDEN STOP AND LAYING HIS FINGER ON HIS LIP DREW HIS COMPANIONS BACK AGAIN WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION AND CIRCUMSPECTION WHATS THE MATTER DEMANDED OLIVER HUSH REPLIED THE DODGER DO YOU SEE THAT OLD COVE AT THE BOOKSTALL THE OLD GENTLEMAN OVER THE WAY SAID OLIVER YES I SEE HIM HELL DO SAID THE DODGER A PRIME PLANT OBSERVED MASTER CHARLEY BATES OLIVER LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WITH THE GREATEST SURPRISE BUT HE WAS NOT PERMITTED TO MAKE ANY INQUIRIES FOR THE TWO BOYS WALKED STEALTHILY ACROSS THE ROAD AND SLUNK CLOSE BEHIND THE OLD GENTLEMAN TOWARDS WHOM HIS ATTENTION HAD BEEN DIRECTED OLIVER WALKED A FEW PACES AFTER THEM AND NOT KNOWING WHETHER TO ADVANCE OR RETIRE STOOD LOOKING ON IN SILENT AMAZEMENT THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS A VERY RESPECTABLELOOKING PERSONAGE WITH A POWDERED HEAD AND GOLD SPECTACLES HE WAS DRESSED IN A BOTTLEGREEN COAT WITH A BLACK VELVET COLLAR WORE WHITE TROUSERS AND CARRIED A SMART BAMBOO CANE UNDER HIS ARM HE HAD TAKEN UP A BOOK FROM THE STALL AND THERE HE STOOD READING AWAY AS HARD AS IF HE WERE IN HIS ELBOWCHAIR IN HIS OWN STUDY IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT HE FANCIED HIMSELF THERE INDEED FOR IT WAS PLAIN FROM HIS ABSTRACTION THAT HE SAW NOT THE BOOKSTALL NOR THE STREET NOR THE BOYS NOR IN SHORT ANYTHING BUT THE BOOK ITSELF WHICH HE WAS READING STRAIGHT THROUGH TURNING OVER THE LEAF WHEN HE GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF A PAGE BEGINNING AT THE TOP LINE OF THE NEXT ONE AND GOING REGULARLY ON WITH THE GREATEST INTEREST AND EAGERNESS WHAT WAS OLIVERS HORROR AND ALARM AS HE STOOD A FEW PACES OFF LOOKING ON WITH HIS EYELIDS AS WIDE OPEN AS THEY WOULD POSSIBLY GO TO SEE THE DODGER PLUNGE HIS HAND INTO THE OLD GENTLEMANS POCKET AND DRAW FROM THENCE A HANDKERCHIEF TO SEE HIM HAND THE SAME TO CHARLEY BATES AND FINALLY TO BEHOLD THEM BOTH RUNNING AWAY ROUND THE CORNER AT FULL SPEED IN AN INSTANT THE WHOLE MYSTERY OF THE HANKERCHIEFS AND THE WATCHES AND THE JEWELS AND THE JEW RUSHED UPON THE BOYS MIND HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT WITH THE BLOOD SO TINGLING THROUGH ALL HIS VEINS FROM TERROR THAT HE FELT AS IF HE WERE IN A BURNING FIRE THEN CONFUSED AND FRIGHTENED HE TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND NOT KNOWING WHAT HE DID MADE OFF AS FAST AS HE COULD LAY HIS FEET TO THE GROUND THIS WAS ALL DONE IN A MINUTES SPACE IN THE VERY INSTANT WHEN OLIVER BEGAN TO RUN THE OLD GENTLEMAN PUTTING HIS HAND TO HIS POCKET AND MISSING HIS HANDKERCHIEF TURNED SHARP ROUND SEEING THE BOY SCUDDING AWAY AT SUCH A RAPID PACE HE VERY NATURALLY CONCLUDED HIM TO BE THE DEPREDATOR AND SHOUTING STOP THIEF WITH ALL HIS MIGHT MADE OFF AFTER HIM BOOK IN HAND BUT THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO RAISED THE HUEANDCRY THE DODGER AND MASTER BATES UNWILLING TO ATTRACT PUBLIC ATTENTION BY RUNNING DOWN THE OPEN STREET HAD MERELY RETIRED INTO THE VERY FIRST DOORWAY ROUND THE CORNER THEY NO SOONER HEARD THE CRY AND SAW OLIVER RUNNING THAN GUESSING EXACTLY HOW THE MATTER STOOD THEY ISSUED FORTH WITH GREAT PROMPTITUDE AND SHOUTING STOP THIEF TOO JOINED IN THE PURSUIT LIKE GOOD CITIZENS ALTHOUGH OLIVER HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP BY PHILOSOPHERS HE WAS NOT THEORETICALLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE BEAUTIFUL AXIOM THAT SELFPRESERVATION IS THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE IF HE HAD BEEN PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR THIS NOT BEING PREPARED HOWEVER IT ALARMED HIM THE MORE SO AWAY HE WENT LIKE THE WIND WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND THE TWO BOYS ROARING AND SHOUTING

HAD CHANGED AND CLOSED UPON BUT WHICH THE MIND SUPERIOR TO ITS POWER STILL DRESSED IN THEIR OLD FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY CALLING BACK THE LUSTRE OF THE EYES THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SMILE THE BEAMING OF THE SOUL THROUGH ITS MASK OF CLAY AND WHISPERING OF BEAUTY BEYOND THE TOMB CHANGED BUT TO BE HEIGHTENED AND TAKEN FROM EARTH ONLY TO BE SET UP AS A LIGHT TO SHED A SOFT AND GENTLE GLOW UPON THE PATH TO

IN THE OTHER IN A PERFECT PHRENZY OF RAGE AND DEFIANCE HE REACHED THE YARD AND HIS PASSION VANISHED IN A MOMENT LITTLE OLIVER TWIST LAY ON HIS BACK ON THE PAVEMENT WITH HIS SHIRT UNBUTTONED AND HIS TEMPLES BATHED WITH WATER HIS FACE A DEADLY WHITE AND A COLD TREMBLE CONVULSING HIS WHOLE FRAME POOR BOY POOR BOY SAID MR BROWNLOW BENDING OVER HIM CALL A COACH SOMEBODY PRAY DIRECTLY A COACH WAS

MR BROWNLOW QUICKLY I FORGOT YOU DEAR DEAR I HAVE THIS UNHAPPY BOOK STILL JUMP IN POOR FELLOW THERES NO TIME TO LOSE THE BOOKSTALL KEEPER GOT INTO THE COACH AND AWAY THEY DROVE CHAPTER XII IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE AND IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDS THE COACH RATTLED AWAY OVER NEARLY THE SAME GROUND AS THAT WHICH OLIVER HAD TRAVERSED WHEN HE FIRST ENTERED LONDON IN COMPANY WITH THE DODGER AND TURNING A DIFFERENT WAY WHEN IT REACHED THE ANGEL AT ISLINGTON STOPPED AT LENGTH BEFORE A NEAT HOUSE IN A QUIET SHADY STREET NEAR PENTONVILLE HERE A BED WAS PREPARED WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME IN WHICH MR BROWNLOW SAW HIS YOUNG CHARGE CAREFULLY AND COMFORTABLY DEPOSITED AND HERE HE WAS TENDED WITH A KINDNESS AND SOLICITUDE THAT KNEW NO BOUNDS BUT FOR MANY DAYS OLIVER REMAINED INSENSIBLE TO ALL THE GOODNESS OF HIS NEW FRIENDS THE SUN ROSE AND SANK AND ROSE AND SANK AGAIN AND MANY TIMES AFTER THAT AND STILL THE BOY LAY STRETCHED ON HIS UNEASY BED DWINDLING AWAY BENEATH THE DRY AND WASTING HEAT OF FEVER THE WORM DOES NOT WORK MORE SURELY ON THE DEAD BODY THAN DOES THIS SLOW CREEPING FIRE UPON THE LIVING FRAME WEAK AND THIN AND PALLID HE AWOKE AT LAST FROM WHAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN A LONG AND TROUBLED DREAM FEEBLY RAISING HIMSELF IN THE BED WITH HIS HEAD RESTING ON HIS TREMBLING ARM HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AROUND WHAT ROOM IS THIS WHERE HAVE I BEEN BROUGHT TO SAID OLIVER THIS IS NOT THE PLACE I WENT TO SLEEP IN HE UTTERED THESE WORDS IN A FEEBLE VOICE BEING VERY FAINT AND WEAK BUT THEY WERE OVERHEARD AT ONCE THE CURTAIN AT THE BEDS HEAD WAS HASTILY DRAWN BACK AND A MOTHERLY OLD LADY VERY NEATLY AND PRECISELY DRESSED ROSE AS SHE UNDREW IT FROM AN ARMCHAIR CLOSE BY IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN SITTING AT NEEDLEWORK HUSH MY DEAR SAID THE OLD LADY SOFTLY YOU MUST BE VERY QUIET OR YOU WILL BE ILL AGAIN AND YOU HAVE BEEN VERY BADAS BAD AS BAD COULD BE PRETTY NIGH LIE DOWN AGAIN THERES A DEAR WITH THOSE WORDS THE OLD LADY VERY GENTLY PLACED OLIVERS HEAD UPON THE PILLOW AND SMOOTHING BACK HIS HAIR FROM HIS FOREHEAD LOOKED SO KINDLY AND LOVING IN HIS FACE THAT HE COULD NOT HELP PLACING HIS LITTLE WITHERED HAND IN HERS AND DRAWING IT ROUND HIS NECK SAVE US SAID THE OLD LADY WITH TEARS IN HER EYES WHAT A GRATEFUL LITTLE DEAR IT IS PRETTY CREETUR WHAT WOULD HIS MOTHER FEEL IF SHE HAD SAT BY HIM AS I HAVE AND COULD SEE HIM NOW PERHAPS SHE DOES SEE ME WHISPERED OLIVER FOLDING HIS HANDS TOGETHER PERHAPS SHE HAS SAT BY ME I ALMOST FEEL AS IF SHE HAD THAT WAS THE FEVER MY DEAR SAID THE OLD LADY MILDLY I SUPPOSE IT WAS REPLIED OLIVER BECAUSE HEAVEN IS A LONG WAY OFF AND THEY ARE TOO HAPPY THERE TO COME DOWN TO THE BEDSIDE OF A POOR BOY BUT IF SHE KNEW I WAS ILL SHE MUST HAVE PITIED ME EVEN THERE FOR SHE WAS VERY ILL HERSELF BEFORE SHE DIED SHE CANT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME THOUGH ADDED OLIVER AFTER A MOMENTS SILENCE IF SHE HAD SEEN ME HURT IT WOULD HAVE MADE HER SORROWFUL AND HER FACE HAS ALWAYS LOOKED SWEET AND HAPPY WHEN I HAVE DREAMED OF HER THE OLD LADY MADE NO REPLY TO THIS BUT WIPING HER EYES FIRST AND HER SPECTACLES WHICH LAY ON THE COUNTERPANE AFTERWARDS AS IF THEY WERE PART AND PARCEL OF THOSE FEATURES BROUGHT SOME COOL STUFF FOR OLIVER TO DRINK AND THEN PATTING HIM ON THE CHEEK TOLD HIM HE MUST LIE VERY QUIET OR HE WOULD BE ILL AGAIN SO OLIVER KEPT VERY STILL PARTLY BECAUSE HE WAS ANXIOUS TO OBEY THE KIND OLD LADY IN ALL THINGS AND PARTLY TO TELL THE TRUTH BECAUSE HE WAS COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED WITH WHAT HE HAD ALREADY SAID HE SOON FELL INTO A GENTLE DOZE FROM WHICH HE WAS AWAKENED BY THE LIGHT OF A CANDLE WHICH BEING BROUGHT NEAR THE BED SHOWED HIM A GENTLEMAN WITH A VERY LARGE AND LOUDTICKING GOLD WATCH IN HIS HAND WHO FELT HIS PULSE AND SAID HE WAS A GREAT DEAL BETTER YOU ARE A GREAT DEAL BETTER ARE YOU NOT MY DEAR SAID THE GENTLEMAN YES THANK YOU SIR REPLIED OLIVER YES I KNOW YOU ARE SAID THE GENTLEMAN YOURE HUNGRY TOO ANT YOU NO SIR ANSWERED OLIVER HEM SAID THE GENTLEMAN NO I KNOW YOURE NOT HE IS NOT HUNGRY MRS BEDWIN SAID THE GENTLEMAN LOOKING VERY WISE THE OLD LADY MADE A RESPECTFUL INCLINATION OF THE HEAD WHICH SEEMED TO SAY THAT SHE THOUGHT THE DOCTOR WAS A VERY CLEVER MAN THE DOCTOR APPEARED MUCH OF THE SAME OPINION HIMSELF YOU FEEL SLEEPY DONT YOU MY DEAR SAID THE DOCTOR NO SIR REPLIED OLIVER NO SAID THE DOCTOR WITH A VERY SHREWD AND SATISFIED LOOK YOURE NOT SLEEPY NOR THIRSTY ARE YOU YES SIR RATHER THIRSTY ANSWERED OLIVER JUST AS I EXPECTED MRS BEDWIN SAID THE DOCTOR ITS VERY NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD BE THIRSTY YOU MAY GIVE HIM A LITTLE TEA MAAM AND SOME DRY TOAST WITHOUT ANY BUTTER DONT KEEP HIM TOO WARM MAAM BUT BE CAREFUL THAT YOU DONT LET HIM BE TOO COLD WILL YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS THE OLD LADY DROPPED A CURTSEY THE DOCTOR AFTER TASTING THE COOL STUFF AND EXPRESSING A QUALIFIED APPROVAL OF IT HURRIED AWAY HIS BOOTS CREAKING IN A VERY IMPORTANT AND WEALTHY MANNER AS HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS OLIVER DOZED OFF AGAIN SOON AFTER THIS WHEN HE AWOKE IT WAS NEARLY TWELVE OCLOCK THE OLD LADY TENDERLY BADE HIM GOODNIGHT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS AND LEFT HIM IN CHARGE OF A FAT OLD WOMAN WHO HAD JUST COME BRINGING WITH HER IN A LITTLE BUNDLE A SMALL PRAYER BOOK AND A LARGE NIGHTCAP PUTTING THE LATTER ON HER HEAD AND THE FORMER ON THE TABLE THE OLD WOMAN AFTER TELLING OLIVER THAT SHE HAD COME TO SIT UP WITH HIM DREW HER CHAIR CLOSE TO THE FIRE AND WENT OFF INTO A SERIES OF SHORT NAPS CHEQUERED AT FREQUENT INTERVALS WITH SUNDRY TUMBLINGS FORWARD AND DIVERS MOANS AND CHOKINGS THESE HOWEVER HAD NO WORSE EFFECT THAN CAUSING HER TO RUB HER NOSE VERY HARD AND THEN FALL ASLEEP AGAIN AND THUS THE NIGHT CREPT SLOWLY ON OLIVER LAY AWAKE FOR SOME TIME COUNTING THE LITTLE CIRCLES OF LIGHT WHICH THE REFLECTION OF THE RUSHLIGHTSHADE THREW UPON THE CEILING OR TRACING WITH HIS LANGUID EYES THE INTRICATE PATTERN OF THE PAPER ON THE WALL THE DARKNESS AND THE DEEP STILLNESS OF THE ROOM WERE VERY SOLEMN AS THEY BROUGHT INTO THE BOYS MIND THE THOUGHT THAT DEATH HAD BEEN HOVERING THERE FOR MANY DAYS AND NIGHTS AND MIGHT YET FILL IT WITH THE GLOOM AND DREAD OF HIS AWFUL PRESENCE HE TURNED HIS FACE UPON THE PILLOW AND FERVENTLY PRAYED TO HEAVEN GRADUALLY HE FELL INTO THAT DEEP TRANQUIL SLEEP WHICH EASE FROM RECENT SUFFERING ALONE IMPARTS THAT CALM AND PEACEFUL REST WHICH IT IS PAIN TO WAKE FROM WHO IF THIS WERE DEATH WOULD BE ROUSED AGAIN TO ALL THE STRUGGLES AND TURMOILS OF LIFE TO ALL ITS CARES FOR THE PRESENT ITS ANXIETIES FOR THE FUTURE MORE THAN ALL ITS WEARY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE PAST IT HAD BEEN BRIGHT DAY FOR HOURS WHEN OLIVER OPENED HIS EYES HE FELT CHEERFUL AND HAPPY THE CRISIS OF THE DISEASE WAS SAFELY PAST HE BELONGED TO THE WORLD AGAIN IN THREE DAYS TIME HE WAS ABLE TO SIT IN AN EASYCHAIR WELL PROPPED UP WITH PILLOWS AND AS HE WAS STILL TOO WEAK TO WALK MRS BEDWIN HAD HIM CARRIED DOWNSTAIRS INTO THE LITTLE HOUSEKEEPERS ROOM WHICH BELONGED TO HER HAVING HIM SET HERE BY THE FIRESIDE THE GOOD OLD LADY SAT HERSELF DOWN TOO AND BEING IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE DELIGHT AT SEEING HIM SO MUCH BETTER FORTHWITH BEGAN TO CRY MOST VIOLENTLY NEVER MIND ME MY DEAR SAID THE OLD LADY IM ONLY HAVING A REGULAR GOOD CRY THERE ITS ALL OVER NOW AND IM QUITE COMFORTABLE YOURE VERY VERY KIND TO ME MAAM SAID OLIVER WELL NEVER YOU MIND THAT MY DEAR SAID THE OLD LADY THATS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR BROTH AND ITS FULL TIME YOU HAD IT FOR THE DOCTOR SAYS MR BROWNLOW MAY COME IN TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING AND WE MUST GET UP OUR BEST LOOKS BECAUSE THE BETTER WE LOOK THE MORE HELL BE PLEASED AND WITH THIS THE OLD LADY APPLIED HERSELF TO WARMING UP IN A LITTLE SAUCEPAN A BASIN FULL OF BROTH STRONG ENOUGH OLIVER THOUGHT TO FURNISH AN AMPLE DINNER WHEN REDUCED TO THE REGULATION STRENGTH FOR THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAUPERS AT THE LOWEST COMPUTATION ARE YOU FOND OF PICTURES DEAR INQUIRED THE OLD LADY SEEING THAT OLIVER HAD FIXED HIS EYES MOST INTENTLY ON A PORTRAIT WHICH HUNG AGAINST THE WALL JUST OPPOSITE HIS CHAIR I DONT QUITE KNOW MAAM SAID OLIVER WITHOUT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THE CANVAS I HAVE SEEN SO FEW THAT I HARDLY KNOW WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MILD FACE THAT LADYS IS AH SAID THE OLD LADY PAINTERS ALWAYS MAKE LADIES OUT PRETTIER THAN THEY ARE OR THEY WOULDNT GET ANY CUSTOM CHILD THE MAN THAT INVENTED THE MACHINE FOR TAKING LIKENESSES MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT WOULD NEVER SUCCEED ITS A DEAL TOO HONEST A DEAL SAID THE OLD LADY LAUGHING VERY HEARTILY AT HER OWN ACUTENESS ISIS THAT A LIKENESS MAAM SAID OLIVER YES SAID THE OLD LADY LOOKING UP FOR A MOMENT FROM THE BROTH THATS A PORTRAIT WHOSE MAAM ASKED OLIVER WHY REALLY MY DEAR I DONT KNOW ANSWERED THE OLD LADY IN A GOODHUMOURED MANNER ITS NOT A LIKENESS OF ANYBODY THAT YOU OR I KNOW I EXPECT IT SEEMS TO STRIKE YOUR FANCY DEAR IT IS SO PRETTY REPLIED OLIVER WHY SURE YOURE NOT AFRAID OF IT SAID THE OLD LADY OBSERVING IN GREAT SURPRISE THE LOOK OF AWE WITH WHICH THE CHILD REGARDED THE PAINTING OH NO NO RETURNED OLIVER QUICKLY BUT THE EYES LOOK SO SORROWFUL AND WHERE I SIT THEY SEEM FIXED UPON ME IT MAKES MY HEART BEAT ADDED OLIVER IN A LOW VOICE AS IF IT WAS ALIVE AND WANTED TO SPEAK TO ME BUT COULDNT LORD SAVE US EXCLAIMED THE OLD LADY STARTING DONT TALK IN THAT WAY CHILD YOURE WEAK AND NERVOUS AFTER YOUR ILLNESS LET ME WHEEL YOUR CHAIR ROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN YOU WONT SEE IT THERE SAID THE OLD LADY SUITING THE ACTION TO THE WORD YOU DONT SEE IT NOW AT ALL EVENTS OLIVER DID SEE IT IN HIS MINDS EYE AS DISTINCTLY AS IF HE HAD NOT ALTERED HIS POSITION BUT HE THOUGHT IT BETTER NOT TO WORRY THE KIND OLD LADY SO HE SMILED GENTLY WHEN SHE LOOKED AT HIM AND MRS BEDWIN SATISFIED THAT HE FELT MORE COMFORTABLE SALTED AND BROKE BITS OF TOASTED BREAD INTO THE BROTH WITH ALL THE BUSTLE BEFITTING SO SOLEMN A PREPARATION OLIVER GOT THROUGH IT WITH EXTRAORDINARY EXPEDITION HE HAD SCARCELY SWALLOWED THE LAST SPOONFUL WHEN THERE CAME A SOFT RAP AT THE DOOR COME IN SAID THE OLD LADY AND IN WALKED MR BROWNLOW NOW THE OLD GENTLEMAN CAME IN AS BRISK AS NEED BE BUT HE HAD NO SOONER RAISED HIS SPECTACLES ON HIS FOREHEAD AND THRUST HIS HANDS BEHIND THE SKIRTS OF HIS DRESSINGGOWN TO TAKE A GOOD LONG LOOK AT OLIVER THAN HIS COUNTENANCE UNDERWENT A VERY GREAT VARIETY OF ODD CONTORTIONS OLIVER LOOKED VERY WORN AND SHADOWY FROM SICKNESS AND MADE AN INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPT TO STAND UP OUT OF RESPECT TO HIS BENEFACTOR WHICH TERMINATED IN HIS SINKING BACK INTO THE CHAIR AGAIN AND THE FACT IS IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD THAT MR BROWNLOWS HEART BEING LARGE ENOUGH FOR ANY SIX ORDINARY OLD GENTLEMEN OF HUMANE DISPOSITION FORCED A SUPPLY OF TEARS INTO HIS EYES BY SOME HYDRAULIC PROCESS WHICH WE ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY PHILOSOPHICAL TO BE IN A CONDITION TO EXPLAIN POOR BOY POOR BOY SAID MR BROWNLOW CLEARING HIS THROAT IM RATHER HOARSE THIS MORNING MRS BEDWIN IM AFRAID I HAVE CAUGHT COLD I HOPE NOT SIR SAID MRS BEDWIN EVERYTHING YOU HAVE HAD HAS BEEN WELL AIRED SIR I DONT KNOW BEDWIN I DONT KNOW SAID MR BROWNLOW I RATHER THINK I HAD A DAMP NAPKIN AT DINNERTIME YESTERDAY BUT NEVER MIND THAT HOW DO YOU FEEL MY DEAR VERY HAPPY SIR REPLIED OLIVER AND VERY GRATEFUL INDEED SIR FOR YOUR GOODNESS TO ME GOOD BY SAID MR BROWNLOW STOUTLY HAVE YOU GIVEN HIM ANY NOURISHMENT BEDWIN ANY SLOPS EH HE HAS JUST HAD A BASIN OF BEAUTIFUL STRONG BROTH SIR REPLIED MRS BEDWIN DRAWING HERSELF UP SLIGHTLY AND LAYING STRONG EMPHASIS ON THE LAST WORD TO INTIMATE THAT BETWEEN SLOPS AND BROTH WILL COMPOUNDED THERE EXISTED NO AFFINITY OR CONNECTION WHATSOEVER UGH SAID MR BROWNLOW WITH A SLIGHT SHUDDER A COUPLE OF GLASSES OF PORT WINE WOULD HAVE DONE HIM A GREAT DEAL MORE GOOD WOULDNT THEY TOM WHITE EH MY NAME IS OLIVER SIR REPLIED THE LITTLE INVALID WITH A LOOK OF GREAT ASTONISHMENT OLIVER SAID MR BROWNLOW OLIVER WHAT OLIVER WHITE EH NO SIR TWIST OLIVER TWIST QUEER NAME SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHAT MADE YOU TELL THE MAGISTRATE YOUR NAME WAS WHITE I NEVER TOLD HIM SO SIR RETURNED OLIVER IN AMAZEMENT THIS SOUNDED SO LIKE A FALSEHOOD THAT THE OLD GENTLEMAN LOOKED SOMEWHAT STERNLY IN OLIVERS FACE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DOUBT HIM THERE WAS TRUTH IN EVERY ONE OF ITS THIN AND SHARPENED LINEAMENTS SOME MISTAKE SAID MR BROWNLOW BUT ALTHOUGH HIS MOTIVE FOR LOOKING STEADILY AT OLIVER NO LONGER EXISTED THE OLD IDEA OF THE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN HIS FEATURES AND SOME FAMILIAR FACE CAME UPON HIM SO STRONGLY THAT HE COULD NOT WITHDRAW HIS GAZE I HOPE YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME SIR SAID OLIVER RAISING HIS EYES BESEECHINGLY NO NO REPLIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHY WHATS THIS BEDWIN LOOK THERE AS HE SPOKE HE POINTED HASTILY TO THE PICTURE OVER OLIVERS HEAD AND THEN TO THE BOYS FACE THERE WAS ITS LIVING COPY THE EYES THE HEAD THE MOUTH EVERY FEATURE WAS THE SAME THE EXPRESSION WAS FOR THE INSTANT SO PRECISELY ALIKE THAT THE MINUTEST LINE SEEMED COPIED WITH STARTLING ACCURACY OLIVER KNEW NOT THE CAUSE OF THIS SUDDEN EXCLAMATION FOR NOT BEING STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE START IT GAVE HIM HE FAINTED AWAY A WEAKNESS ON HIS PART WHICH AFFORDS THE NARRATIVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF RELIEVING THE READER FROM SUSPENSE IN BEHALF OF THE TWO YOUNG PUPILS OF THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND OF RECORDING THAT WHEN THE DODGER AND HIS ACCOMPLISHED FRIEND MASTER BATES JOINED IN THE HUEANDCRY WHICH WAS RAISED AT OLIVERS HEELS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR EXECUTING AN ILLEGAL CONVEYANCE OF MR BROWNLOWS PERSONAL PROPERTY AS HAS BEEN ALREADY DESCRIBED THEY WERE ACTUATED BY A VERY LAUDABLE AND BECOMING REGARD FOR THEMSELVES AND FORASMUCH AS THE FREEDOM OF THE SUBJECT AND THE LIBERTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL ARE AMONG THE FIRST AND PROUDEST BOASTS OF A TRUEHEARTED ENGLISHMAN SO I NEED HARDLY BEG THE READER TO OBSERVE THAT THIS ACTION SHOULD TEND TO EXALT THEM IN THE OPINION OF ALL PUBLIC AND PATRIOTIC MEN IN ALMOST AS GREAT A DEGREE AS THIS STRONG PROOF OF THEIR ANXIETY FOR THEIR OWN PRESERVATION AND SAFETY GOES TO CORROBORATE AND CONFIRM THE LITTLE CODE OF LAWS WHICH CERTAIN PROFOUND AND SOUNDJUDGING PHILOSOPHERS HAVE LAID DOWN AS THE MAINSPRINGS OF ALL NATURES DEEDS AND ACTIONS THE SAID PHILOSOPHERS VERY WISELY REDUCING THE GOOD LADYS PROCEEDINGS TO MATTERS OF MAXIM AND THEORY AND BY A VERY NEAT AND PRETTY COMPLIMENT TO HER EXALTED WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING PUTTING ENTIRELY OUT OF SIGHT ANY CONSIDERATIONS OF HEART OR GENEROUS IMPULSE AND FEELING FOR THESE ARE MATTERS TOTALLY BENEATH A FEMALE WHO IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY UNIVERSAL ADMISSION TO BE FAR ABOVE THE NUMEROUS LITTLE FOIBLES AND WEAKNESSES OF HER SEX IF I WANTED ANY FURTHER PROOF OF THE STRICTLY PHILOSOPHICAL NATURE OF THE CONDUCT OF THESE YOUNG GENTLEMEN IN THEIR VERY DELICATE PREDICAMENT I SHOULD AT ONCE FIND IT IN THE FACT ALSO RECORDED IN A FOREGOING PART OF THIS NARRATIVE OF THEIR QUITTING THE PURSUIT WHEN THE GENERAL ATTENTION WAS FIXED UPON OLIVER AND MAKING IMMEDIATELY FOR THEIR HOME BY THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE CUT ALTHOUGH I DO NOT MEAN TO ASSERT THAT IT IS USUALLY THE PRACTICE OF RENOWNED AND LEARNED SAGES TO SHORTEN THE ROAD TO ANY GREAT CONCLUSION THEIR COURSE INDEED BEING RATHER TO LENGTHEN THE DISTANCE BY VARIOUS CIRCUMLOCUTIONS AND DISCURSIVE STAGGERINGS LIKE UNTO THOSE IN WHICH DRUNKEN MEN UNDER THE PRESSURE OF A TOO MIGHTY FLOW OF IDEAS ARE PRONE TO INDULGE STILL I DO MEAN TO SAY AND DO SAY DISTINCTLY THAT IT IS THE INVARIABLE PRACTICE OF MANY MIGHTY PHILOSOPHERS IN CARRYING OUT THEIR THEORIES TO EVINCE GREAT WISDOM AND FORESIGHT IN PROVIDING AGAINST EVERY POSSIBLE CONTINGENCY WHICH CAN BE SUPPOSED AT ALL LIKELY TO AFFECT THEMSELVES THUS TO DO A GREAT RIGHT YOU MAY DO A LITTLE WRONG AND YOU MAY TAKE ANY MEANS WHICH THE END TO BE ATTAINED WILL JUSTIFY THE AMOUNT OF THE RIGHT OR THE AMOUNT OF THE WRONG OR INDEED THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO BEING LEFT ENTIRELY TO THE PHILOSOPHER CONCERNED TO BE SETTLED AND DETERMINED BY HIS CLEAR COMPREHENSIVE AND IMPARTIAL VIEW OF HIS OWN PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE TWO BOYS HAD SCOURED WITH GREAT RAPIDITY THROUGH A MOST INTRICATE MAZE OF NARROW STREETS AND COURTS THAT THEY VENTURED TO HALT BENEATH A LOW AND DARK ARCHWAY HAVING REMAINED SILENT HERE JUST LONG ENOUGH TO RECOVER BREATH TO SPEAK MASTER BATES UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION OF AMUSEMENT AND DELIGHT AND BURSTING INTO AN UNCONTROLLABLE FIT OF LAUGHTER FLUNG HIMSELF UPON A DOORSTEP AND ROLLED THEREON IN A TRANSPORT OF MIRTH WHATS THE MATTER INQUIRED THE DODGER HA HA HA ROARED CHARLEY BATES HOLD YOUR NOISE REMONSTRATED THE DODGER LOOKING CAUTIOUSLY ROUND DO YOU WANT TO BE GRABBED STUPID I CANT HELP IT SAID CHARLEY I CANT HELP IT TO SEE HIM SPLITTING AWAY AT THAT PACE AND CUTTING ROUND THE CORNERS AND KNOCKING UP AGAIN THE POSTS AND STARTING ON AGAIN AS IF HE WAS MADE OF IRON AS WELL AS THEM AND ME WITH THE WIPE IN MY POCKET SINGING OUT ARTER HIMOH MY EYE THE VIVID IMAGINATION OF MASTER BATES PRESENTED THE SCENE BEFORE HIM IN TOO STRONG COLOURS AS HE ARRIVED AT THIS APOSTROPHE HE AGAIN ROLLED UPON THE DOORSTEP AND LAUGHED LOUDER THAN BEFORE WHATLL FAGIN SAY INQUIRED THE DODGER TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE NEXT INTERVAL OF BREATHLESSNESS ON THE PART OF HIS FRIEND TO PROPOUND THE QUESTION WHAT REPEATED CHARLEY BATES AH WHAT SAID THE DODGER WHY WHAT SHOULD HE SAY INQUIRED CHARLEY STOPPING RATHER SUDDENLY IN HIS MERRIMENT FOR THE DODGERS MANNER WAS IMPRESSIVE WHAT SHOULD HE SAY MR DAWKINS WHISTLED FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN TAKING OFF HIS HAT SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND NODDED THRICE WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID CHARLEY TOOR RUL LOL LOO GAMMON AND SPINNAGE THE FROG HE WOULDNT AND HIGH COCKOLORUM SAID THE DODGER WITH A SLIGHT SNEER ON HIS INTELLECTUAL COUNTENANCE THIS WAS EXPLANATORY BUT NOT SATISFACTORY MASTER BATES FELT IT SO AND AGAIN SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE DODGER MADE NO REPLY BUT PUTTING HIS HAT ON AGAIN AND GATHERING THE SKIRTS OF HIS LONGTAILED COAT UNDER HIS ARM THRUST HIS TONGUE INTO HIS CHEEK SLAPPED THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE SOME HALFDOZEN TIMES IN A FAMILIAR BUT EXPRESSIVE MANNER AND TURNING ON HIS HEEL SLUNK DOWN THE COURT MASTER BATES FOLLOWED WITH A THOUGHTFUL COUNTENANCE THE NOISE OF FOOTSTEPS ON THE CREAKING STAIRS A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE OCCURRENCE OF THIS CONVERSATION ROUSED THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AS HE SAT OVER THE FIRE WITH A SAVELOY AND A SMALL LOAF IN HIS HAND A POCKETKNIFE IN HIS RIGHT AND A PEWTER POT ON THE TRIVET THERE WAS A RASCALLY SMILE ON HIS WHITE FACE AS HE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKING SHARPLY OUT FROM UNDER HIS THICK RED EYEBROWS BENT HIS EAR TOWARDS THE DOOR AND LISTENED WHY HOWS THIS MUTTERED THE JEW CHANGING COUNTENANCE ONLY TWO OF EM WHERES THE THIRD THEY CANT HAVE GOT INTO TROUBLE HARK THE FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED NEARER THEY REACHED THE LANDING THE DOOR WAS SLOWLY OPENED AND THE DODGER AND CHARLEY BATES ENTERED CLOSING IT BEHIND THEM CHAPTER XIII SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY WHERES OLIVER SAID THE JEW RISING WITH A MENACING LOOK WHERES THE BOY THE YOUNG THIEVES EYED THEIR PRECEPTOR AS IF THEY WERE ALARMED AT HIS VIOLENCE AND LOOKED UNEASILY AT EACH OTHER BUT THEY MADE NO REPLY WHATS BECOME OF THE BOY SAID THE JEW SEIZING THE DODGER TIGHTLY BY THE COLLAR AND THREATENING HIM WITH HORRID IMPRECATIONS SPEAK OUT OR ILL THROTTLE YOU MR FAGIN LOOKED SO VERY MUCH IN EARNEST THAT CHARLEY BATES WHO DEEMED IT PRUDENT IN ALL CASES TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE AND WHO CONCEIVED IT BY NO MEANS IMPROBABLE THAT IT MIGHT BE HIS TURN TO BE THROTTLED SECOND DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES AND RAISED A LOUD WELLSUSTAINED AND CONTINUOUS ROARSOMETHING BETWEEN A MAD BULL AND A SPEAKING TRUMPET WILL YOU SPEAK THUNDERED THE JEW SHAKING THE DODGER SO MUCH THAT HIS KEEPING IN THE BIG COAT AT ALL SEEMED PERFECTLY MIRACULOUS WHY THE TRAPS HAVE GOT HIM AND THATS ALL ABOUT IT SAID THE DODGER SULLENLY COME LET GO O ME WILL YOU AND SWINGING HIMSELF AT ONE JERK CLEAN OUT OF THE BIG COAT WHICH HE LEFT IN THE JEWS HANDS THE DODGER SNATCHED UP THE TOASTING FORK AND MADE A PASS AT THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMANS WAISTCOAT WHICH IF IT HAD TAKEN EFFECT WOULD HAVE LET A LITTLE MORE MERRIMENT OUT THAN COULD HAVE BEEN EASILY REPLACED THE JEW STEPPED BACK IN THIS EMERGENCY WITH MORE AGILITY THAN COULD HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED IN A MAN OF HIS APPARENT DECREPITUDE AND SEIZING UP THE POT PREPARED TO HURL IT AT HIS ASSAILANTS HEAD BUT CHARLEY BATES AT THIS MOMENT CALLING HIS ATTENTION BY A PERFECTLY TERRIFIC HOWL HE SUDDENLY ALTERED ITS DESTINATION AND FLUNG IT FULL AT THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHY WHAT THE BLAZES IS IN THE WIND NOW GROWLED A DEEP VOICE WHO PITCHED THAT ERE AT ME ITS WELL ITS THE BEER AND NOT THE POT AS HIT ME OR ID HAVE SETTLED SOMEBODY I MIGHT HAVE KNOWD AS NOBODY BUT AN INFERNAL RICH PLUNDERING THUNDERING OLD JEW COULD AFFORD TO THROW AWAY ANY DRINK BUT WATERAND NOT THAT UNLESS HE DONE THE RIVER COMPANY EVERY

LEGS WITH LARGE SWELLING CALVESTHE KIND OF LEGS WHICH IN SUCH COSTUME ALWAYS LOOK IN AN UNFINISHED AND INCOMPLETE STATE WITHOUT A SET OF FETTERS TO GARNISH THEM HE HAD A BROWN HAT ON HIS HEAD AND A DIRTY BELCHER HANDKERCHIEF ROUND HIS NECK WITH THE LONG FRAYED ENDS OF WHICH HE SMEARED THE BEER FROM HIS FACE AS HE SPOKE HE DISCLOSED WHEN HE HAD DONE SO A BROAD HEAVY COUNTENANCE WITH A BEARD OF THREE DAYS GROWTH AND TWO SCOWLING EYES ONE OF WHICH DISPLAYED VARIOUS PARTICOLOURED SYMPTOMS OF HAVING BEEN RECENTLY DAMAGED BY A BLOW COME IN DYE HEAR GROWLED THIS ENGAGING RUFFIAN A WHITE SHAGGY DOG WITH HIS FACE SCRATCHED AND TORN IN TWENTY DIFFERENT PLACES SKULKED INTO THE ROOM WHY DIDNT YOU COME IN AFORE SAID THE MAN YOURE GETTING TOO PROUD TO OWN ME AFORE COMPANY ARE YOU LIE DOWN THIS COMMAND WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH A KICK WHICH SENT THE ANIMAL TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM HE APPEARED WELL USED TO IT HOWEVER FOR HE COILED HIMSELF UP IN A CORNER VERY QUIETLY WITHOUT UTTERING A SOUND AND WINKING HIS VERY ILLLOOKING EYES TWENTY TIMES IN A MINUTE APPEARED TO OCCUPY HIMSELF IN TAKING A SURVEY OF THE APARTMENT WHAT ARE YOU UP TO ILLTREATING THE BOYS YOU COVETOUS AVARICIOUS INSATIABLE OLD FENCE SAID THE MAN SEATING HIMSELF DELIBERATELY I WONDER THEY DONT MURDER YOU I WOULD IF I WAS THEM IF ID BEEN YOUR PRENTICE ID HAVE DONE IT LONG AGO ANDNO I COULDNT HAVE SOLD YOU AFTERWARDS FOR

BLAB AND ARE YOU MAD SAID THE JEW CATCHING THE MAN BY THE SLEEVE AND POINTING TOWARDS THE BOYS MR SIKES CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH TYING AN IMAGINARY KNOT UNDER HIS LEFT EAR AND JERKING HIS HEAD OVER ON THE RIGHT SHOULDER A PIECE OF DUMB SHOW WHICH THE JEW APPEARED TO UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY HE THEN IN CANT TERMS WITH WHICH HIS WHOLE CONVERSATION WAS PLENTIFULLY BESPRINKLED BUT WHICH WOULD BE QUITE UNINTELLIGIBLE IF THEY WERE RECORDED HERE DEMANDED A GLASS OF LIQUOR AND MIND YOU DONT POISON IT SAID MR SIKES LAYING HIS HAT UPON THE TABLE THIS WAS SAID IN JEST BUT IF THE SPEAKER COULD HAVE SEEN THE EVIL LEER WITH WHICH THE JEW BIT HIS PALE LIP AS HE TURNED ROUND TO THE CUPBOARD HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THE CAUTION NOT WHOLLY UNNECESSARY OR THE WISH AT ALL EVENTS TO IMPROVE UPON THE DISTILLERS INGENUITY NOT VERY FAR FROM THE OLD GENTLEMANS MERRY HEART AFTER SWALLOWING TWO OF THREE GLASSES OF SPIRITS MR SIKES CONDESCENDED TO TAKE SOME NOTICE OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHICH GRACIOUS ACT LED TO A CONVERSATION IN WHICH THE CAUSE AND MANNER OF OLIVERS CAPTURE WERE CIRCUMSTANTIALLY DETAILED WITH SUCH ALTERATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS ON THE TRUTH AS TO THE DODGER APPEARED MOST ADVISABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IM AFRAID SAID THE JEW THAT HE MAY SAY SOMETHING WHICH WILL GET US INTO TROUBLE THATS VERY LIKELY RETURNED SIKES WITH A MALICIOUS GRIN YOURE BLOWED UPON FAGIN AND IM AFRAID YOU SEE ADDED THE JEW SPEAKING AS IF HE HAD NOT NOTICED THE INTERRUPTION AND REGARDING THE OTHER CLOSELY AS HE DID SOIM AFRAID THAT IF THE GAME WAS UP WITH US IT MIGHT BE UP WITH A GOOD MANY MORE AND THAT IT WOULD COME OUT RATHER WORSE FOR YOU THAN IT WOULD FOR ME MY DEAR THE MAN STARTED AND TURNED ROUND UPON THE JEW BUT THE OLD GENTLEMANS SHOULDERS WERE SHRUGGED UP TO HIS EARS AND HIS EYES WERE VACANTLY STARING ON THE OPPOSITE WALL THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE EVERY MEMBER OF THE RESPECTABLE COTERIE APPEARED PLUNGED IN HIS OWN REFLECTIONS NOT EXCEPTING THE DOG WHO BY A CERTAIN MALICIOUS LICKING OF HIS LIPS SEEMED TO BE MEDITATING AN ATTACK UPON THE LEGS OF THE FIRST GENTLEMAN OR LADY HE MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN THE STREETS WHEN HE WENT OUT SOMEBODY MUST FIND OUT WOTS BEEN DONE AT THE OFFICE SAID MR SIKES IN A

US AMONG HIS NEW FRIENDS WE MAY STOP HIS MOUTH YET CHAPTER XIV COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVERS STAY AT MR BROWNLOWS WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND OLIVER SOON RECOVERING FROM THE FAINTINGFIT INTO WHICH MR BROWNLOWS ABRUPT EXCLAMATION HAD THROWN HIM THE SUBJECT OF THE PICTURE WAS CAREFULLY AVOIDED BOTH BY THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND MRS BEDWIN IN THE CONVERSATION THAT ENSUED WHICH INDEED BORE NO REFERENCE TO OLIVERS HISTORY OR PROSPECTS BUT WAS CONFINED TO SUCH TOPICS AS MIGHT AMUSE WITHOUT EXCITING HIM HE WAS STILL TOO WEAK TO GET UP TO BREAKFAST BUT WHEN HE CAME DOWN INTO THE HOUSEKEEPERS ROOM NEXT DAY HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO CAST AN EAGER GLANCE AT THE WALL IN THE HOPE OF AGAIN LOOKING ON THE FACE OF THE BEAUTIFUL LADY HIS EXPECTATIONS WERE DISAPPOINTED HOWEVER FOR THE PICTURE HAD BEEN REMOVED AH SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER WATCHING THE DIRECTION OF OLIVERS EYES IT IS GONE YOU SEE I SEE IT IS MAAM REPLIED OLIVER WHY HAVE THEY TAKEN IT AWAY IT HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN CHILD BECAUSE MR BROWNLOW SAID THAT AS IT SEEMED TO WORRY YOU PERHAPS IT MIGHT PREVENT YOUR GETTING WELL YOU KNOW REJOINED THE OLD LADY OH NO

PROMISE YOU THAT NOW LET US TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THIS WAS ALL THE INFORMATION OLIVER COULD OBTAIN ABOUT THE PICTURE AT THAT TIME AS THE OLD LADY HAD BEEN SO KIND TO HIM IN HIS ILLNESS HE ENDEAVOURED TO THINK NO MORE OF THE SUBJECT JUST THEN SO HE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO A GREAT MANY STORIES SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT AN AMIABLE AND HANDSOME DAUGHTER OF HERS WHO WAS MARRIED TO AN AMIABLE AND HANDSOME MAN AND LIVED IN THE COUNTRY AND ABOUT A SON WHO WAS CLERK TO A MERCHANT IN THE WEST INDIES AND WHO WAS ALSO SUCH A GOOD YOUNG MAN AND WROTE SUCH DUTIFUL LETTERS HOME FOUR TIMES AYEAR THAT IT BROUGHT THE TEARS INTO HER EYES TO TALK ABOUT THEM WHEN THE OLD LADY HAD EXPATIATED A LONG TIME ON THE EXCELLENCES OF HER CHILDREN AND THE MERITS OF HER KIND GOOD HUSBAND BESIDES WHO HAD BEEN DEAD AND GONE POOR DEAR SOUL JUST SIXANDTWENTY YEARS IT WAS TIME TO HAVE TEA AFTER TEA SHE BEGAN TO TEACH OLIVER CRIBBAGE WHICH HE LEARNT AS QUICKLY AS SHE COULD TEACH AND AT WHICH GAME THEY PLAYED WITH GREAT INTEREST AND GRAVITY UNTIL IT WAS TIME FOR THE INVALID TO HAVE SOME WARM WINE AND WATER WITH A SLICE OF DRY TOAST AND THEN TO GO COSILY TO BED THEY WERE HAPPY DAYS THOSE OF OLIVERS RECOVERY EVERYTHING WAS SO QUIET AND NEAT AND ORDERLY EVERYBODY SO KIND AND GENTLE THAT AFTER THE NOISE AND TURBULENCE IN THE MIDST OF WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LIVED IT SEEMED LIKE HEAVEN ITSELF HE WAS NO SOONER STRONG ENOUGH TO PUT HIS CLOTHES ON PROPERLY THAN MR BROWNLOW CAUSED A COMPLETE NEW SUIT AND A NEW CAP AND A NEW PAIR OF SHOES TO BE PROVIDED FOR HIM AS OLIVER WAS TOLD THAT HE MIGHT DO WHAT HE LIKED WITH THE OLD CLOTHES HE GAVE THEM TO A SERVANT WHO HAD BEEN VERY KIND TO HIM AND ASKED HER TO SELL THEM TO A JEW AND KEEP THE MONEY FOR HERSELF THIS SHE VERY READILY DID AND AS OLIVER LOOKED OUT OF THE PARLOUR WINDOW AND SAW THE JEW ROLL THEM UP IN HIS BAG AND WALK AWAY HE FELT QUITE DELIGHTED TO THINK THAT THEY WERE SAFELY GONE AND THAT THERE WAS NOW NO POSSIBLE DANGER OF HIS EVER BEING ABLE TO WEAR THEM AGAIN THEY WERE SAD RAGS TO TELL THE TRUTH AND OLIVER HAD NEVER HAD A NEW SUIT BEFORE ONE EVENING ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE AFFAIR OF THE PICTURE AS HE WAS SITTING TALKING TO MRS BEDWIN THERE CAME A MESSAGE DOWN FROM MR BROWNLOW THAT IF OLIVER TWIST FELT PRETTY WELL HE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM IN HIS STUDY AND TALK TO HIM A LITTLE WHILE BLESS US AND SAVE US WASH YOUR HANDS AND LET ME PART YOUR HAIR NICELY FOR YOU CHILD SAID MRS BEDWIN DEAR HEART ALIVE IF WE HAD KNOWN HE WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR YOU WE WOULD HAVE PUT YOU A CLEAN COLLAR ON AND MADE YOU AS SMART AS SIXPENCE OLIVER DID AS THE OLD LADY BADE HIM AND ALTHOUGH SHE LAMENTED GRIEVOUSLY MEANWHILE THAT THERE WAS NOT EVEN TIME TO CRIMP THE LITTLE FRILL THAT BORDERED HIS SHIRTCOLLAR HE LOOKED SO DELICATE AND HANDSOME DESPITE THAT IMPORTANT PERSONAL ADVANTAGE THAT SHE WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY LOOKING AT HIM WITH GREAT COMPLACENCY FROM HEAD TO FOOT THAT SHE REALLY DIDNT THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE ON THE LONGEST NOTICE TO HAVE MADE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN HIM FOR THE BETTER THUS ENCOURAGED OLIVER TAPPED AT THE STUDY DOOR ON MR BROWNLOW CALLING TO HIM TO COME IN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A LITTLE BACK ROOM QUITE FULL OF BOOKS WITH A WINDOW LOOKING INTO SOME PLEASANT LITTLE GARDENS THERE WAS A TABLE DRAWN UP BEFORE THE WINDOW AT WHICH MR BROWNLOW WAS SEATED READING WHEN HE SAW OLIVER HE PUSHED THE BOOK AWAY FROM HIM AND TOLD HIM TO COME NEAR THE TABLE AND SIT DOWN OLIVER COMPLIED MARVELLING WHERE THE PEOPLE COULD BE FOUND TO READ SUCH A GREAT NUMBER OF BOOKS AS SEEMED TO BE WRITTEN TO MAKE THE WORLD WISER WHICH IS STILL A MARVEL TO MORE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE THAN OLIVER TWIST EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES THERE ARE A GOOD MANY BOOKS ARE THERE NOT MY BOY SAID MR BROWNLOW OBSERVING THE CURIOSITY WITH WHICH OLIVER SURVEYED THE SHELVES THAT REACHED FROM THE FLOOR TO THE CEILING A GREAT NUMBER SIR REPLIED OLIVER I NEVER SAW SO MANY YOU SHALL READ THEM IF YOU BEHAVE WELL SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN KINDLY AND YOU WILL LIKE THAT BETTER THAN LOOKING AT THE OUTSIDESTHAT IS SOME CASES BECAUSE THERE ARE BOOKS OF WHICH THE BACKS AND COVERS ARE BY FAR THE BEST PARTS I SUPPOSE THEY ARE THOSE HEAVY ONES SIR SAID OLIVER POINTING TO SOME LARGE QUARTOS WITH A GOOD DEAL OF GILDING ABOUT THE BINDING NOT ALWAYS THOSE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN PATTING OLIVER ON THE HEAD AND SMILING AS HE DID SO THERE ARE OTHER EQUALLY HEAVY ONES THOUGH OF A MUCH SMALLER SIZE HOW SHOULD YOU LIKE TO GROW UP A CLEVER MAN AND WRITE BOOKS EH I THINK I WOULD RATHER READ THEM SIR REPLIED OLIVER WHAT WOULDNT YOU LIKE TO BE A BOOKWRITER SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN OLIVER CONSIDERED A LITTLE WHILE AND AT LAST SAID HE SHOULD THINK IT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER THING TO BE A BOOKSELLER UPON WHICH THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED HEARTILY AND DECLARED HE HAD SAID A VERY GOOD THING WHICH OLIVER FELT GLAD TO HAVE DONE THOUGH HE BY NO MEANS KNEW WHAT IT WAS WELL WELL SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPOSING HIS FEATURES DONT BE AFRAID WE WONT MAKE AN AUTHOR OF YOU WHILE THERES AN HONEST TRADE TO BE LEARNT OR BRICKMAKING TO TURN TO THANK YOU SIR SAID OLIVER AT THE EARNEST MANNER OF HIS REPLY THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED AGAIN AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A CURIOUS INSTINCT WHICH OLIVER NOT UNDERSTANDING PAID NO VERY GREAT ATTENTION TO NOW SAID MR BROWNLOW SPEAKING IF POSSIBLE IN A KINDER BUT AT THE SAME TIME IN A MUCH MORE SERIOUS MANNER THAN OLIVER HAD EVER KNOWN HIM ASSUME YET I WANT YOU TO PAY GREAT ATTENTION MY BOY TO WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY I SHALL TALK TO YOU WITHOUT ANY RESERVE BECAUSE I AM SURE YOU ARE WELL ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ME AS MANY OLDER PERSONS WOULD BE OH DONT TELL YOU

SERVANT DONT SEND ME BACK TO THE WRETCHED PLACE I CAME FROM HAVE MERCY UPON A POOR BOY SIR MY DEAR CHILD SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN MOVED BY THE WARMTH OF OLIVERS SUDDEN APPEAL YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY DESERTING YOU UNLESS YOU GIVE ME CAUSE I NEVER NEVER WILL SIR INTERPOSED OLIVER I HOPE NOT REJOINED THE OLD GENTLEMAN I DO NOT THINK YOU EVER WILL I HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BEFORE IN THE OBJECTS WHOM I

BESTOWED MY DEAREST LOVE LIE DEEP IN THEIR GRAVES BUT ALTHOUGH THE HAPPINESS AND DELIGHT OF MY LIFE LIE BURIED THERE TOO I HAVE NOT MADE A COFFIN OF MY HEART AND SEALED IT UP FOREVER ON MY BEST AFFECTIONS DEEP AFFLICTION HAS BUT STRENGTHENED AND REFINED THEM AS THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAID THIS IN A LOW VOICE MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO HIS COMPANION AND AS HE REMAINED SILENT FOR A SHORT TIME AFTERWARDS OLIVER SAT QUITE STILL WELL WELL SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN AT LENGTH IN A MORE CHEERFUL TONE I ONLY SAY THIS BECAUSE YOU HAVE A YOUNG HEART AND KNOWING THAT I HAVE SUFFERED GREAT PAIN AND SORROW YOU WILL BE MORE CAREFUL PERHAPS NOT TO WOUND ME AGAIN YOU SAY YOU ARE AN ORPHAN WITHOUT A FRIEND IN THE WORLD ALL THE INQUIRIES I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE CONFIRM THE STATEMENT LET ME HEAR YOUR STORY WHERE YOU COME FROM WHO BROUGHT YOU UP AND HOW YOU GOT INTO THE COMPANY IN WHICH I FOUND YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH AND YOU SHALL NOT BE FRIENDLESS WHILE I LIVE OLIVERS SOBS CHECKED HIS UTTERANCE FOR SOME MINUTES WHEN HE WAS ON THE POINT OF BEGINNING TO RELATE HOW HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP AT THE FARM AND CARRIED TO THE WORKHOUSE BY MR BUMBLE A PECULIARLY IMPATIENT LITTLE DOUBLEKNOCK WAS HEARD AT THE STREETDOOR AND THE SERVANT RUNNING UPSTAIRS ANNOUNCED MR GRIMWIG IS HE COMING UP INQUIRED MR BROWNLOW YES SIR REPLIED THE SERVANT HE ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY MUFFINS IN THE HOUSE AND WHEN I TOLD HIM YES HE SAID HE HAD COME TO TEA MR BROWNLOW SMILED AND TURNING TO OLIVER SAID THAT MR GRIMWIG WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF HIS AND HE MUST NOT MIND HIS BEING A LITTLE ROUGH IN HIS MANNERS FOR HE WAS A WORTHY CREATURE AT BOTTOM AS HE HAD REASON TO KNOW SHALL I GO DOWNSTAIRS SIR INQUIRED OLIVER NO REPLIED MR BROWNLOW I WOULD RATHER YOU REMAINED HERE AT THIS MOMENT THERE WALKED INTO THE ROOM SUPPORTING HIMSELF BY A THICK STICK A STOUT OLD GENTLEMAN RATHER LAME IN ONE LEG WHO WAS DRESSED IN A BLUE COAT STRIPED WAISTCOAT NANKEEN BREECHES AND GAITERS AND A BROADBRIMMED WHITE HAT WITH THE SIDES TURNED UP WITH GREEN A VERY SMALLPLAITED SHIRT FRILL STUCK OUT FROM HIS WAISTCOAT AND A VERY LONG STEEL WATCHCHAIN WITH NOTHING BUT A KEY AT THE END DANGLED LOOSELY BELOW IT THE ENDS OF HIS WHITE NECKERCHIEF WERE TWISTED INTO A BALL ABOUT THE SIZE OF AN ORANGE THE VARIETY OF SHAPES INTO WHICH HIS COUNTENANCE WAS TWISTED DEFY DESCRIPTION HE HAD A MANNER OF SCREWING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WHEN HE SPOKE AND OF LOOKING OUT OF THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES AT THE SAME TIME WHICH IRRESISTIBLY REMINDED THE BEHOLDER OF A PARROT IN THIS ATTITUDE HE FIXED HIMSELF THE MOMENT HE MADE HIS APPEARANCE AND HOLDING OUT A SMALL PIECE OF ORANGEPEEL AT ARMS LENGTH EXCLAIMED IN A GROWLING DISCONTENTED VOICE LOOK HERE DO YOU SEE THIS ISNT IT A MOST WONDERFUL AND EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT I CANT CALL AT A MANS HOUSE BUT I FIND A PIECE OF THIS POOR SURGEONS FRIEND ON THE STAIRCASE IVE BEEN LAMED WITH ORANGEPEEL ONCE AND I KNOW ORANGEPEEL WILL BE MY DEATH OR ILL BE CONTENT TO EAT MY OWN HEAD SIR THIS WAS THE HANDSOME OFFER WITH WHICH MR GRIMWIG BACKED AND CONFIRMED NEARLY EVERY ASSERTION HE MADE AND IT WAS THE MORE SINGULAR IN HIS CASE BECAUSE EVEN ADMITTING FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THE POSSIBILITY OF SCIENTIFIC IMPROVEMENTS BEING BROUGHT TO THAT PASS WHICH WILL ENABLE A GENTLEMAN TO EAT HIS OWN HEAD IN THE EVENT OF HIS BEING SO DISPOSED MR GRIMWIGS HEAD WAS SUCH A PARTICULARLY LARGE ONE THAT THE MOST SANGUINE MAN ALIVE COULD HARDLY ENTERTAIN A HOPE OF BEING ABLE TO GET THROUGH IT AT A SITTINGTO PUT ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION A VERY THICK COATING OF POWDER ILL EAT MY HEAD SIR REPEATED MR GRIMWIG STRIKING HIS STICK

STREET AND I KNOW ITS PUT THERE BY THE SURGEONS BOY AT THE CORNER A YOUNG WOMAN STUMBLED OVER A BIT LAST NIGHT AND FELL AGAINST MY GARDENRAILINGS DIRECTLY SHE GOT UP I SAW HER LOOK TOWARDS HIS INFERNAL RED LAMP WITH THE PANTOMIMELIGHT DONT GO TO HIM I CALLED OUT OF THE WINDOW HES AN ASSASSIN A MANTRAP SO HE IS IF HE IS NOT HERE THE IRASCIBLE OLD GENTLEMAN GAVE A GREAT KNOCK ON THE GROUND WITH HIS STICK WHICH WAS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD BY HIS FRIENDS TO IMPLY THE CUSTOMARY OFFER WHENEVER IT WAS NOT EXPRESSED IN WORDS THEN STILL KEEPING HIS STICK IN HIS HAND HE SAT DOWN AND OPENING A DOUBLE EYEGLASS WHICH HE WORE ATTACHED TO A BROAD BLACK RIBAND TOOK A VIEW OF OLIVER WHO SEEING THAT HE WAS THE OBJECT OF INSPECTION COLOURED AND BOWED AGAIN THATS THE BOY IS IT SAID MR GRIMWIG AT LENGTH

WHERE DOES HE COME FROM WHO IS HE WHAT IS HE HE HAS HAD A FEVER WHAT OF THAT FEVERS ARE NOT PECULIAR TO GOOD PEOPLE ARE THEY BAD PEOPLE HAVE FEVERS SOMETIMES HAVENT THEY EH I KNEW A MAN WHO WAS HUNG IN JAMAICA FOR MURDERING HIS MASTER HE HAD HAD A FEVER SIX TIMES HE WASNT RECOMMENDED TO MERCY ON THAT ACCOUNT POOH NONSENSE NOW THE FACT WAS THAT IN THE INMOST RECESSES OF HIS OWN HEART MR GRIMWIG WAS STRONGLY DISPOSED TO ADMIT THAT OLIVERS APPEARANCE AND MANNER WERE UNUSUALLY PREPOSSESSING BUT HE HAD A STRONG APPETITE FOR CONTRADICTION SHARPENED ON THIS OCCASION BY THE FINDING OF THE ORANGEPEEL AND INWARDLY DETERMINING THAT NO MAN SHOULD DICTATE TO HIM WHETHER A BOY WAS WELLLOOKING OR NOT HE HAD RESOLVED FROM THE FIRST TO OPPOSE HIS FRIEND WHEN MR BROWNLOW ADMITTED THAT ON NO ONE POINT OF INQUIRY COULD HE YET RETURN A SATISFACTORY ANSWER AND THAT HE HAD POSTPONED ANY INVESTIGATION INTO OLIVERS PREVIOUS HISTORY UNTIL HE THOUGHT THE BOY WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO HEAR IT MR GRIMWIG CHUCKLED MALICIOUSLY AND HE DEMANDED WITH A SNEER WHETHER THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS IN THE HABIT OF COUNTING THE PLATE AT NIGHT BECAUSE IF SHE DIDNT FIND A TABLESPOON OR TWO MISSING SOME SUNSHINY MORNING WHY HE WOULD BE CONTENT TOAND SO FORTH ALL THIS MR BROWNLOW ALTHOUGH HIMSELF SOMEWHAT OF AN IMPETUOUS GENTLEMAN KNOWING HIS FRIENDS PECULIARITIES BORE WITH GREAT GOOD HUMOUR AS MR GRIMWIG AT TEA WAS GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO EXPRESS HIS ENTIRE APPROVAL OF THE MUFFINS MATTERS WENT ON VERY SMOOTHLY AND OLIVER WHO MADE ONE OF THE PARTY BEGAN TO FEEL MORE AT HIS EASE THAN HE HAD YET DONE IN THE FIERCE OLD GENTLEMANS PRESENCE AND WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO HEAR A FULL TRUE AND PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF OLIVER TWIST ASKED GRIMWIG OF MR BROWNLOW AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEAL LOOKING

BOOKSTALLKEEPER WHO HAS ALREADY FIGURED IN THIS HISTORY HAVING LAID THEM ON THE TABLE SHE PREPARED TO LEAVE THE ROOM STOP THE BOY MRS BEDWIN SAID MR BROWNLOW THERE IS SOMETHING TO GO BACK HE HAS GONE SIR REPLIED MRS BEDWIN CALL AFTER HIM SAID MR BROWNLOW ITS PARTICULAR HE IS A POOR MAN AND THEY ARE NOT PAID FOR THERE ARE SOME BOOKS TO BE TAKEN BACK TOO THE STREETDOOR WAS OPENED OLIVER RAN ONE WAY

OF HIM DEAR ME I AM VERY SORRY FOR THAT EXCLAIMED MR BROWNLOW I PARTICULARLY WISHED THOSE BOOKS TO BE RETURNED TONIGHT SEND OLIVER WITH THEM SAID MR GRIMWIG WITH AN IRONICAL SMILE HE WILL BE SURE TO DELIVER THEM SAFELY YOU KNOW YES DO LET ME TAKE THEM IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID OLIVER ILL RUN ALL THE WAY SIR THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT OLIVER SHOULD NOT GO OUT ON ANY ACCOUNT WHEN A MOST MALICIOUS COUGH FROM MR GRIMWIG DETERMINED HIM THAT HE SHOULD AND THAT BY HIS PROMPT DISCHARGE OF THE COMMISSION HE SHOULD PROVE TO HIM THE INJUSTICE OF HIS SUSPICIONS ON THIS HEAD AT LEAST AT ONCE YOU SHALL GO MY DEAR SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE BOOKS ARE ON A CHAIR BY MY TABLE FETCH THEM DOWN OLIVER DELIGHTED TO BE OF USE BROUGHT DOWN THE BOOKS UNDER HIS ARM IN A GREAT BUSTLE AND WAITED CAP IN HAND TO HEAR WHAT MESSAGE HE WAS TO TAKE YOU ARE TO SAY SAID MR BROWNLOW GLANCING STEADILY AT GRIMWIG YOU ARE TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT THOSE BOOKS BACK AND THAT YOU HAVE COME TO PAY THE FOUR POUND TEN I OWE HIM THIS IS A FIVEPOUND NOTE SO YOU WILL HAVE TO BRING ME BACK TEN SHILLINGS CHANGE I WONT BE TEN MINUTES SIR SAID OLIVER EAGERLY HAVING BUTTONED UP THE BANKNOTE IN HIS JACKET POCKET AND PLACED THE BOOKS CAREFULLY UNDER HIS ARM HE MADE A RESPECTFUL BOW AND LEFT THE ROOM MRS BEDWIN FOLLOWED HIM TO THE STREETDOOR GIVING HIM MANY DIRECTIONS ABOUT THE NEAREST WAY AND THE NAME OF THE BOOKSELLER AND THE NAME OF THE STREET ALL OF WHICH OLIVER SAID HE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD HAVING SUPERADDED MANY INJUNCTIONS TO BE SURE AND NOT TAKE COLD THE OLD LADY AT LENGTH PERMITTED HIM TO DEPART BLESS HIS SWEET FACE SAID THE OLD LADY LOOKING AFTER HIM I CANT BEAR SOMEHOW TO LET HIM GO OUT OF MY SIGHT AT THIS MOMENT OLIVER LOOKED GAILY ROUND AND NODDED BEFORE HE TURNED THE CORNER THE OLD LADY SMILINGLY RETURNED HIS SALUTATION AND CLOSING THE DOOR WENT BACK TO HER OWN ROOM LET ME SEE HELL BE BACK IN TWENTY MINUTES AT THE LONGEST SAID MR BROWNLOW PULLING OUT HIS WATCH AND PLACING IT ON THE TABLE IT WILL BE DARK BY THAT TIME OH YOU REALLY EXPECT HIM TO COME BACK DO YOU INQUIRED MR GRIMWIG DONT YOU ASKED MR BROWNLOW SMILING THE SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION WAS STRONG IN MR GRIMWIGS BREAST AT THE MOMENT AND IT WAS RENDERED STRONGER BY HIS FRIENDS CONFIDENT SMILE NO HE SAID SMITING THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST I DO NOT THE BOY HAS A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES ON HIS BACK A SET OF VALUABLE BOOKS UNDER HIS ARM AND A FIVEPOUND NOTE IN HIS POCKET HELL JOIN HIS OLD FRIENDS THE THIEVES AND LAUGH AT YOU IF EVER THAT BOY RETURNS TO THIS HOUSE SIR ILL EAT MY HEAD WITH THESE WORDS HE DREW HIS CHAIR CLOSER TO THE TABLE AND THERE THE TWO FRIENDS SAT IN SILENT EXPECTATION WITH THE WATCH BETWEEN THEM IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK AS ILLUSTRATING THE IMPORTANCE WE ATTACH TO OUR OWN JUDGMENTS AND THE PRIDE WITH WHICH WE PUT FORTH OUR MOST RASH AND HASTY CONCLUSIONS THAT ALTHOUGH MR GRIMWIG WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS A BADHEARTED MAN AND THOUGH HE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFEIGNEDLY SORRY TO SEE HIS RESPECTED FRIEND DUPED AND DECEIVED HE REALLY DID MOST EARNESTLY AND STRONGLY HOPE AT THAT MOMENT THAT OLIVER TWIST MIGHT NOT COME BACK IT GREW SO DARK THAT THE FIGURES ON THE DIALPLATE WERE SCARCELY DISCERNIBLE BUT THERE THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN CONTINUED TO SIT IN SILENCE WITH THE WATCH BETWEEN THEM CHAPTER XV SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE IN THE OBSCURE PARLOUR OF A LOW PUBLICHOUSE IN THE FILTHIEST PART OF LITTLE SAFFRON HILL A DARK AND GLOOMY DEN WHERE A FLARING GASLIGHT BURNT ALL DAY IN THE WINTERTIME AND WHERE NO RAY OF SUN EVER SHONE IN THE SUMMER THERE SAT BROODING OVER A LITTLE PEWTER MEASURE AND A SMALL GLASS STRONGLY IMPREGNATED WITH THE SMELL OF LIQUOR A MAN IN A VELVETEEN COAT DRAB SHORTS HALFBOOTS AND STOCKINGS WHOM EVEN BY THAT DIM LIGHT NO EXPERIENCED AGENT OF THE POLICE WOULD HAVE HESITATED TO RECOGNISE AS MR WILLIAM SIKES AT HIS FEET SAT A WHITECOATED REDEYED DOG WHO OCCUPIED HIMSELF ALTERNATELY IN WINKING AT HIS MASTER WITH BOTH EYES AT THE SAME TIME AND IN LICKING A LARGE FRESH CUT ON ONE SIDE OF HIS MOUTH WHICH APPEARED TO BE THE RESULT OF SOME RECENT CONFLICT KEEP QUIET YOU WARMINT KEEP QUIET SAID MR SIKES SUDDENLY BREAKING SILENCE WHETHER HIS MEDITATIONS WERE SO INTENSE AS TO BE DISTURBED BY THE DOGS WINKING OR WHETHER HIS FEELINGS WERE SO WROUGHT UPON BY HIS REFLECTIONS THAT THEY REQUIRED ALL THE RELIEF DERIVABLE FROM KICKING AN UNOFFENDING ANIMAL TO ALLAY THEM IS MATTER FOR ARGUMENT AND CONSIDERATION WHATEVER WAS THE CAUSE THE EFFECT WAS A KICK AND A CURSE BESTOWED UPON THE DOG SIMULTANEOUSLY DOGS ARE NOT GENERALLY APT TO REVENGE INJURIES INFLICTED UPON THEM BY THEIR MASTERS BUT MR SIKESS DOG HAVING FAULTS OF TEMPER IN COMMON WITH HIS OWNER AND LABOURING PERHAPS AT THIS MOMENT UNDER A POWERFUL SENSE OF INJURY MADE NO MORE ADO BUT AT ONCE FIXED HIS TEETH IN ONE OF THE HALFBOOTS HAVING GIVEN IN A HEARTY SHAKE HE RETIRED GROWLING UNDER A FORM JUST ESCAPING THE PEWTER MEASURE WHICH MR SIKES LEVELLED AT HIS HEAD YOU WOULD WOULD YOU SAID SIKES SEIZING THE POKER IN ONE HAND AND DELIBERATELY OPENING WITH THE OTHER A LARGE CLASPKNIFE WHICH HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET COME HERE YOU BORN

LESS STARTLING ONLY THERE WE ARE BUSY ACTORS INSTEAD OF PASSIVE LOOKERSON WHICH MAKES A VAST DIFFERENCE THE ACTORS IN THE MIMIC LIFE OF THE THEATRE ARE BLIND TO VIOLENT TRANSITIONS AND ABRUPT IMPULSES OF PASSION OR FEELING WHICH PRESENTED BEFORE THE EYES OF MERE SPECTATORS ARE AT ONCE CONDEMNED AS OUTRAGEOUS AND PREPOSTEROUS AS SUDDEN SHIFTINGS OF THE SCENE AND RAPID CHANGES OF TIME AND PLACE ARE NOT ONLY SANCTIONED IN BOOKS BY LONG USAGE BUT ARE BY MANY CONSIDERED AS THE GREAT ART OF AUTHORSHIP AN AUTHORS SKILL IN HIS CRAFT BEING BY SUCH CRITICS CHIEFLY ESTIMATED WITH RELATION TO THE DILEMMAS IN WHICH HE LEAVES HIS CHARACTERS AT THE END OF EVERY CHAPTER THIS BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE PRESENT ONE MAY PERHAPS BE DEEMED UNNECESSARY IF SO LET IT BE CONSIDERED A DELICATE INTIMATION ON THE PART OF THE HISTORIAN THAT HE IS GOING BACK TO THE TOWN IN WHICH OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN THE READER TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT THERE ARE GOOD AND SUBSTANTIAL REASONS FOR MAKING THE JOURNEY OR HE WOULD NOT BE INVITED TO PROCEED UPON SUCH AN EXPEDITION MR BUMBLE EMERGED AT EARLY MORNING FROM THE WORKHOUSEGATE AND WALKED WITH PORTLY CARRIAGE AND COMMANDING STEPS UP THE HIGH STREET HE WAS IN THE FULL BLOOM AND PRIDE OF BEADLEHOOD HIS COCKED HAT AND COAT WERE DAZZLING IN THE MORNING SUN HE CLUTCHED HIS CANE WITH THE VIGOROUS TENACITY OF HEALTH AND POWER MR BUMBLE ALWAYS CARRIED HIS HEAD HIGH BUT THIS MORNING IT WAS HIGHER THAN USUAL THERE WAS AN ABSTRACTION IN HIS EYE AN ELEVATION IN HIS AIR WHICH MIGHT HAVE WARNED AN OBSERVANT STRANGER THAT THOUGHTS WERE PASSING IN THE BEADLES MIND TOO GREAT FOR UTTERANCE MR BUMBLE STOPPED NOT TO CONVERSE WITH THE SMALL SHOPKEEPERS AND OTHERS WHO SPOKE TO HIM DEFERENTIALLY AS HE PASSED ALONG HE MERELY RETURNED THEIR SALUTATIONS WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND AND RELAXED NOT IN HIS DIGNIFIED PACE UNTIL HE REACHED THE FARM WHERE MRS MANN TENDED THE INFANT PAUPERS WITH PAROCHIAL CARE DRAT THAT BEADLE SAID MRS MANN HEARING THE WELLKNOWN SHAKING AT THE GARDENGATE

AFTERWARDS TOOK HIMSELF OFF TO PREPARE FOR HIS JOURNEY AT SIX OCLOCK NEXT MORNING MR BUMBLE HAVING EXCHANGED HIS COCKED HAT FOR A ROUND ONE AND ENCASED HIS PERSON IN A BLUE GREATCOAT WITH A CAPE TO IT TOOK HIS PLACE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE COACH ACCOMPANIED BY THE CRIMINALS WHOSE SETTLEMENT WAS DISPUTED WITH WHOM IN DUE COURSE OF TIME HE ARRIVED IN LONDON HE EXPERIENCED NO OTHER CROSSES ON THE WAY THAN THOSE WHICH ORIGINATED IN THE PERVERSE BEHAVIOUR OF THE TWO PAUPERS WHO PERSISTED IN SHIVERING AND COMPLAINING OF THE COLD IN A MANNER WHICH MR BUMBLE DECLARED CAUSED HIS TEETH TO CHATTER IN HIS HEAD AND MADE HIM FEEL QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE ALTHOUGH HE HAD A GREATCOAT ON HAVING DISPOSED OF THESE EVILMINDED PERSONS FOR THE NIGHT MR BUMBLE SAT HIMSELF DOWN IN THE HOUSE AT WHICH THE COACH STOPPED AND TOOK A TEMPERATE DINNER OF STEAKS OYSTER SAUCE AND PORTER PUTTING A GLASS OF HOT GINANDWATER ON THE CHIMNEYPIECE HE DREW HIS CHAIR TO THE FIRE AND WITH SUNDRY MORAL REFLECTIONS ON THE TOOPREVALENT SIN OF DISCONTENT AND COMPLAINING COMPOSED HIMSELF TO READ THE PAPER THE VERY FIRST PARAGRAPH UPON WHICH MR BUMBLES EYE RESTED WAS THE FOLLOWING ADVERTISEMENT FIVE GUINEAS REWARD WHEREAS A YOUNG BOY

A FULL DESCRIPTION OF OLIVERS DRESS PERSON APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE WITH THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF MR BROWNLOW AT FULL LENGTH MR BUMBLE OPENED HIS EYES READ THE ADVERTISEMENT SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY THREE SEVERAL TIMES AND IN SOMETHING MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES WAS ON HIS WAY TO PENTONVILLE HAVING ACTUALLY IN HIS EXCITEMENT LEFT THE GLASS OF HOT GINANDWATER UNTASTED IS MR BROWNLOW AT HOME INQUIRED MR BUMBLE OF THE GIRL WHO OPENED THE DOOR TO THIS INQUIRY THE GIRL RETURNED THE NOT UNCOMMON BUT RATHER EVASIVE REPLY OF I DONT KNOW WHERE DO YOU COME FROM MR BUMBLE NO SOONER UTTERED OLIVERS NAME IN EXPLANATION OF HIS ERRAND THAN MRS BEDWIN WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE PARLOUR DOOR HASTENED INTO THE PASSAGE IN A BREATHLESS STATE COME IN COME IN SAID THE OLD LADY I KNEW WE SHOULD HEAR OF HIM POOR DEAR I KNEW WE SHOULD I WAS CERTAIN OF IT BLESS HIS HEART I SAID SO ALL ALONG HAVING HEARD THIS THE WORTHY OLD LADY HURRIED BACK INTO THE PARLOUR AGAIN AND SEATING HERSELF ON A SOFA BURST INTO TEARS THE GIRL WHO WAS NOT QUITE SO SUSCEPTIBLE HAD RUN UPSTAIRS MEANWHILE AND NOW RETURNED WITH A REQUEST THAT MR BUMBLE WOULD FOLLOW HER IMMEDIATELY WHICH HE DID HE WAS SHOWN INTO THE LITTLE BACK STUDY WHERE SAT MR BROWNLOW AND HIS FRIEND MR GRIMWIG WITH DECANTERS AND GLASSES BEFORE THEM THE LATTER GENTLEMAN AT ONCE BURST INTO THE EXCLAMATION A BEADLE A PARISH BEADLE OR ILL EAT MY HEAD PRAY DONT INTERRUPT JUST NOW SAID MR BROWNLOW TAKE A SEAT WILL YOU MR BUMBLE SAT HIMSELF DOWN QUITE CONFOUNDED BY THE ODDITY OF MR GRIMWIGS MANNER MR BROWNLOW MOVED THE LAMP SO AS TO OBTAIN AN UNINTERRUPTED VIEW OF THE BEADLES COUNTENANCE AND SAID WITH A LITTLE IMPATIENCE NOW SIR YOU COME IN CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING SEEN THE ADVERTISEMENT YES SIR SAID MR BUMBLE AND YOU ARE A BEADLE ARE YOU NOT INQUIRED MR GRIMWIG I AM A POROCHIAL BEADLE GENTLEMEN REJOINED MR BUMBLE PROUDLY OF COURSE OBSERVED MR GRIMWIG ASIDE TO HIS FRIEND I KNEW HE WAS A BEADLE ALL OVER MR BROWNLOW GENTLY SHOOK HIS HEAD TO IMPOSE SILENCE ON HIS FRIEND AND RESUMED DO YOU KNOW WHERE THIS POOR BOY IS NOW NO MORE THAN NOBODY REPLIED MR BUMBLE WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF HIM INQUIRED THE OLD GENTLEMAN SPEAK OUT MY FRIEND IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF HIM YOU DONT HAPPEN TO KNOW ANY GOOD OF HIM DO YOU SAID MR GRIMWIG CAUSTICALLY AFTER AN ATTENTIVE PERUSAL OF MR BUMBLES FEATURES MR BUMBLE CATCHING AT THE INQUIRY VERY QUICKLY SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH PORTENTOUS SOLEMNITY YOU SEE SAID MR GRIMWIG LOOKING TRIUMPHANTLY AT MR BROWNLOW MR BROWNLOW LOOKED APPREHENSIVELY AT MR BUMBLES PURSEDUP COUNTENANCE AND REQUESTED HIM TO COMMUNICATE WHAT HE KNEW REGARDING OLIVER IN AS FEW WORDS AS POSSIBLE MR BUMBLE PUT DOWN HIS HAT UNBUTTONED HIS COAT FOLDED HIS ARMS INCLINED HIS HEAD IN A RETROSPECTIVE MANNER AND AFTER A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION COMMENCED HIS STORY IT WOULD BE TEDIOUS IF GIVEN IN THE BEADLES WORDS OCCUPYING AS IT DID SOME TWENTY MINUTES IN THE TELLING BUT THE SUM AND SUBSTANCE OF IT WAS THAT OLIVER WAS A FOUNDLING BORN OF LOW AND VICIOUS PARENTS THAT HE HAD FROM HIS BIRTH DISPLAYED NO BETTER QUALITIES THAN TREACHERY INGRATITUDE AND MALICE THAT HE HAD TERMINATED HIS BRIEF CAREER IN THE PLACE OF HIS BIRTH BY MAKING A SANGUINARY AND COWARDLY ATTACK ON AN UNOFFENDING LAD AND RUNNING AWAY IN THE NIGHTTIME FROM HIS MASTERS HOUSE IN PROOF OF HIS REALLY BEING THE PERSON HE REPRESENTED HIMSELF MR BUMBLE LAID UPON THE TABLE THE PAPERS HE HAD BROUGHT TO TOWN FOLDING HIS ARMS AGAIN HE THEN AWAITED MR BROWNLOWS OBSERVATIONS I FEAR IT IS ALL TOO TRUE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN SORROWFULLY AFTER LOOKING OVER THE PAPERS THIS IS NOT MUCH FOR YOUR INTELLIGENCE BUT I WOULD GLADLY HAVE GIVEN YOU TREBLE THE MONEY IF IT HAD BEEN FAVOURABLE TO THE BOY IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT IF MR BUMBLE HAD BEEN POSSESSED OF THIS INFORMATION AT AN EARLIER PERIOD OF THE INTERVIEW HE MIGHT HAVE IMPARTED A VERY DIFFERENT COLOURING TO HIS LITTLE HISTORY IT WAS TOO LATE TO DO IT NOW HOWEVER SO HE SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY AND POCKETING THE FIVE GUINEAS WITHDREW MR BROWNLOW PACED THE ROOM TO AND FRO FOR SOME MINUTES EVIDENTLY SO MUCH DISTURBED BY THE BEADLES TALE THAT EVEN MR GRIMWIG FORBORE TO VEX HIM FURTHER AT LENGTH HE STOPPED AND RANG THE BELL VIOLENTLY MRS BEDWIN SAID MR BROWNLOW WHEN THE HOUSEKEEPER APPEARED THAT BOY OLIVER IS AN IMPOSTER IT CANT BE SIR IT CANNOT BE SAID THE OLD LADY ENERGETICALLY I TELL YOU HE IS RETORTED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY CANT BE WE HAVE JUST HEARD A FULL ACCOUNT OF HIM FROM HIS BIRTH AND HE HAS BEEN A THOROUGHPACED LITTLE VILLAIN ALL HIS LIFE I NEVER WILL BELIEVE IT SIR REPLIED THE OLD LADY FIRMLY NEVER YOU OLD WOMEN NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING BUT QUACKDOCTORS AND LYING STORYBOOKS GROWLED MR GRIMWIG I KNEW IT ALL ALONG WHY DIDNT YOU TAKE MY ADVISE IN THE BEGINNING YOU WOULD IF HE HADNT HAD A FEVER I SUPPOSE EH HE WAS INTERESTING WASNT HE INTERESTING BAH AND MR GRIMWIG POKED THE FIRE WITH A FLOURISH HE WAS A DEAR GRATEFUL GENTLE CHILD SIR RETORTED MRS BEDWIN INDIGNANTLY I KNOW WHAT CHILDREN ARE SIR AND HAVE DONE THESE FORTY YEARS AND PEOPLE WHO CANT SAY THE SAME SHOULDNT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THEM THATS MY OPINION THIS WAS A HARD HIT AT MR GRIMWIG WHO WAS A BACHELOR AS IT EXTORTED NOTHING FROM THAT GENTLEMAN BUT A SMILE THE OLD LADY TOSSED HER HEAD AND SMOOTHED DOWN HER APRON PREPARATORY TO ANOTHER SPEECH WHEN SHE WAS STOPPED BY MR BROWNLOW SILENCE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN FEIGNING AN ANGER HE WAS FAR FROM FEELING NEVER LET ME HEAR THE BOYS NAME AGAIN I RANG TO TELL YOU THAT NEVER NEVER ON ANY PRETENCE MIND YOU MAY LEAVE THE ROOM MRS BEDWIN REMEMBER I AM IN EARNEST THERE WERE SAD HEARTS AT MR BROWNLOWS THAT NIGHT OLIVERS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM WHEN HE THOUGHT OF HIS GOOD FRIENDS IT WAS WELL FOR HIM THAT HE COULD NOT KNOW WHAT THEY HAD HEARD OR IT MIGHT HAVE BROKEN OUTRIGHT CHAPTER XVIII HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS ABOUT NOON NEXT DAY WHEN THE DODGER AND MASTER BATES HAD GONE OUT TO PURSUE THEIR CUSTOMARY AVOCATIONS MR FAGIN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF READING OLIVER A LONG LECTURE ON THE CRYING SIN OF INGRATITUDE OF WHICH HE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED HE HAD BEEN GUILTY TO NO ORDINARY EXTENT IN WILFULLY ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM THE SOCIETY OF HIS ANXIOUS FRIENDS AND STILL MORE IN ENDEAVOURING TO ESCAPE FROM THEM AFTER SO MUCH TROUBLE AND EXPENSE HAD BEEN INCURRED IN HIS RECOVERY MR FAGIN LAID GREAT STRESS ON THE FACT OF HIS HAVING TAKEN OLIVER IN AND CHERISHED HIM WHEN WITHOUT HIS TIMELY AID HE MIGHT HAVE PERISHED WITH HUNGER AND HE RELATED THE DISMAL AND AFFECTING HISTORY OF A YOUNG LAD WHOM IN HIS PHILANTHROPY HE HAD SUCCOURED UNDER PARALLEL CIRCUMSTANCES BUT WHO PROVING UNWORTHY OF HIS CONFIDENCE AND EVINCING A DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE POLICE HAD UNFORTUNATELY COME TO BE HANGED AT THE OLD BAILEY ONE MORNING MR FAGIN DID NOT SEEK TO CONCEAL HIS SHARE IN THE CATASTROPHE BUT LAMENTED WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES THAT THE WRONGHEADED AND TREACHEROUS BEHAVIOUR OF THE YOUNG PERSON IN QUESTION HAD RENDERED IT NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD BECOME THE VICTIM OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE FOR THE CROWN WHICH IF IT WERE NOT PRECISELY TRUE WAS INDISPENSABLY NECESSARY FOR THE SAFETY OF HIM MR FAGIN AND A FEW SELECT FRIENDS MR FAGIN CONCLUDED BY DRAWING A RATHER DISAGREEABLE PICTURE OF THE DISCOMFORTS OF HANGING AND WITH GREAT FRIENDLINESS AND POLITENESS OF MANNER EXPRESSED HIS ANXIOUS HOPES THAT HE MIGHT NEVER BE OBLIGED TO SUBMIT OLIVER TWIST TO THAT UNPLEASANT OPERATION LITTLE OLIVERS BLOOD RAN COLD AS HE LISTENED TO THE JEWS WORDS AND IMPERFECTLY COMPREHENDED THE DARK THREATS CONVEYED IN THEM THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE EVEN FOR JUSTICE ITSELF TO CONFOUND THE INNOCENT WITH THE GUILTY WHEN THEY WERE IN ACCIDENTAL COMPANIONSHIP HE KNEW ALREADY AND THAT DEEPLYLAID PLANS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF INCONVENIENTLY KNOWING OR OVERCOMMUNICATIVE PERSONS HAD BEEN REALLY DEVISED AND CARRIED OUT BY THE JEW ON MORE OCCASIONS THAN ONE HE THOUGHT BY NO MEANS UNLIKELY WHEN HE RECOLLECTED THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE ALTERCATIONS BETWEEN THAT GENTLEMAN AND MR SIKES WHICH SEEMED TO BEAR REFERENCE TO SOME FOREGONE CONSPIRACY OF THE KIND AS HE GLANCED TIMIDLY UP AND MET THE JEWS SEARCHING LOOK HE FELT THAT HIS PALE FACE AND TREMBLING LIMBS WERE NEITHER UNNOTICED NOR UNRELISHED BY THAT WARY OLD GENTLEMAN THE JEW SMILING HIDEOUSLY PATTED OLIVER ON THE HEAD AND SAID THAT IF HE KEPT HIMSELF QUIET AND APPLIED HIMSELF TO BUSINESS HE SAW THEY WOULD BE VERY GOOD FRIENDS YET THEN TAKING HIS HAT AND COVERING HIMSELF WITH AN OLD PATCHED GREATCOAT HE WENT OUT AND LOCKED THE ROOMDOOR BEHIND HIM AND SO OLIVER REMAINED ALL THAT DAY AND FOR THE GREATER PART OF MANY SUBSEQUENT DAYS SEEING NOBODY BETWEEN EARLY MORNING AND MIDNIGHT AND LEFT DURING THE LONG HOURS TO COMMUNE WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS WHICH NEVER FAILING TO REVERT TO HIS KIND FRIENDS AND THE OPINION THEY MUST LONG AGO HAVE FORMED OF HIM WERE SAD INDEED AFTER THE LAPSE OF A WEEK OR SO THE JEW LEFT THE ROOMDOOR UNLOCKED AND HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO WANDER ABOUT THE HOUSE IT WAS A VERY DIRTY PLACE THE ROOMS UPSTAIRS HAD GREAT HIGH WOODEN CHIMNEYPIECES AND LARGE DOORS WITH PANELLED WALLS AND CORNICES TO THE CEILING WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BLACK WITH NEGLECT AND DUST WERE ORNAMENTED IN VARIOUS WAYS FROM ALL OF THESE TOKENS OLIVER CONCLUDED THAT A LONG TIME AGO BEFORE THE OLD JEW WAS BORN IT HAD BELONGED TO BETTER PEOPLE AND HAD PERHAPS BEEN QUITE GAY AND HANDSOME DISMAL AND DREARY AS IT LOOKED NOW SPIDERS HAD BUILT THEIR WEBS IN THE ANGLES OF THE WALLS AND CEILINGS AND SOMETIMES WHEN OLIVER WALKED SOFTLY INTO A ROOM THE MICE WOULD SCAMPER ACROSS THE FLOOR AND RUN BACK TERRIFIED TO THEIR HOLES WITH THESE EXCEPTIONS THERE WAS NEITHER SIGHT NOR SOUND OF ANY LIVING THING AND OFTEN WHEN IT GREW DARK AND HE WAS TIRED OF WANDERING FROM ROOM TO ROOM HE WOULD CROUCH IN THE CORNER OF THE PASSAGE BY THE STREETDOOR TO BE AS NEAR LIVING PEOPLE AS HE COULD AND WOULD REMAIN THERE LISTENING AND COUNTING THE HOURS UNTIL THE JEW OR THE BOYS RETURNED IN ALL THE ROOMS THE MOULDERING SHUTTERS WERE FAST CLOSED THE BARS WHICH HELD THEM WERE SCREWED TIGHT INTO THE WOOD THE ONLY LIGHT WHICH WAS ADMITTED STEALING ITS WAY THROUGH ROUND HOLES AT THE TOP WHICH MADE THE ROOMS MORE GLOOMY AND FILLED THEM WITH STRANGE SHADOWS THERE WAS A BACKGARRET WINDOW WITH RUSTY BARS OUTSIDE WHICH HAD NO SHUTTER AND OUT OF THIS OLIVER OFTEN GAZED WITH A MELANCHOLY FACE FOR HOURS TOGETHER BUT NOTHING WAS TO BE DESCRIED FROM IT BUT A CONFUSED AND CROWDED MASS OF HOUSETOPS BLACKENED CHIMNEYS AND GABLEENDS SOMETIMES INDEED A GRIZZLY HEAD MIGHT BE SEEN PEERING OVER THE PARAPETWALL OF A DISTANT HOUSE BUT IT WAS QUICKLY WITHDRAWN AGAIN AND AS THE WINDOW OF OLIVERS OBSERVATORY WAS NAILED DOWN AND DIMMED WITH THE RAIN AND SMOKE OF YEARS IT WAS AS MUCH AS HE COULD DO TO MAKE OUT THE FORMS OF THE DIFFERENT OBJECTS BEYOND WITHOUT MAKING ANY ATTEMPT TO BE SEEN OR HEARDWHICH HE HAD AS MUCH CHANCE OF BEING AS IF HE HAD LIVED INSIDE THE BALL OF ST PAULS CATHEDRAL ONE AFTERNOON THE DODGER AND MASTER BATES BEING ENGAGED OUT THAT EVENING THE FIRSTNAMED YOUNG GENTLEMAN TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD TO EVINCE SOME ANXIETY REGARDING THE DECORATION OF HIS PERSON TO DO HIM JUSTICE THIS WAS BY NO MEANS AN HABITUAL WEAKNESS WITH HIM AND WITH THIS END AND AIM HE CONDESCENDINGLY COMMANDED OLIVER TO ASSIST HIM IN HIS TOILET STRAIGHTWAY OLIVER WAS BUT TOO GLAD TO MAKE HIMSELF USEFUL TOO HAPPY TO HAVE SOME FACES HOWEVER BAD TO LOOK UPON TOO DESIROUS TO CONCILIATE THOSE ABOUT HIM WHEN HE COULD HONESTLY DO SO TO THROW ANY OBJECTION IN THE WAY OF THIS PROPOSAL SO HE AT ONCE EXPRESSED HIS READINESS AND KNEELING ON THE FLOOR WHILE THE DODGER SAT UPON THE TABLE SO THAT HE COULD TAKE HIS FOOT IN HIS LAPS HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO A PROCESS WHICH MR DAWKINS DESIGNATED AS JAPANNING HIS TROTTERCASES THE PHRASE RENDERED INTO PLAIN ENGLISH SIGNIFIETH CLEANING HIS BOOTS WHETHER IT WAS THE SENSE OF FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE WHICH A RATIONAL ANIMAL MAY BE SUPPOSED TO FEEL WHEN HE SITS ON A TABLE IN AN EASY ATTITUDE SMOKING A PIPE SWINGING ONE LEG CARELESSLY TO AND FRO AND HAVING HIS BOOTS CLEANED ALL THE TIME WITHOUT EVEN THE PAST TROUBLE OF HAVING TAKEN THEM OFF OR THE PROSPECTIVE MISERY OF PUTTING THEM ON TO DISTURB HIS REFLECTIONS OR WHETHER IT WAS THE GOODNESS OF THE TOBACCO THAT SOOTHED THE FEELINGS OF THE DODGER OR THE MILDNESS OF THE BEER THAT MOLLIFIED HIS THOUGHTS HE WAS EVIDENTLY TINCTURED FOR THE NONCE WITH A SPICE OF ROMANCE AND ENTHUSIASM FOREIGN TO HIS GENERAL NATURE HE LOOKED DOWN ON OLIVER WITH A THOUGHTFUL COUNTENANCE FOR A BRIEF SPACE AND THEN RAISING HIS HEAD AND HEAVING A GENTLE SIGN SAID HALF IN ABSTRACTION AND HALF TO MASTER BATES WHAT A PITY IT IS HE ISNT A PRIG AH SAID MASTER CHARLES BATES HE DONT KNOW WHATS GOOD FOR HIM THE DODGER SIGHED AGAIN AND RESUMED HIS PIPE AS DID CHARLEY BATES THEY BOTH SMOKED FOR SOME SECONDS IN SILENCE I SUPPOSE YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT A PRIG IS SAID THE DODGER MOURNFULLY I THINK I KNOW THAT REPLIED OLIVER LOOKING UP ITS A THE YOURE ONE ARE YOU NOT INQUIRED OLIVER CHECKING HIMSELF I AM REPLIED THE DODGER ID SCORN TO BE ANYTHING ELSE MR DAWKINS GAVE HIS HAT A FEROCIOUS COCK AFTER DELIVERING THIS SENTIMENT AND LOOKED AT MASTER BATES AS IF TO DENOTE THAT HE WOULD FEEL OBLIGED BY HIS SAYING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY I AM REPEATED THE DODGER SOS CHARLEY SOS FAGIN SOS SIKES SOS NANCY SOS BET SO WE ALL ARE DOWN TO THE DOG AND HES THE DOWNIEST ONE OF THE LOT AND THE LEAST GIVEN TO PEACHING ADDED CHARLEY BATES HE WOULDNT SO MUCH AS BARK IN A WITNESSBOX FOR FEAR OF COMMITTING HIMSELF NO NOT IF YOU TIED HIM UP IN ONE AND LEFT HIM THERE WITHOUT WITTLES FOR A FORTNIGHT SAID THE DODGER NOT A BIT OF IT OBSERVED CHARLEY HES A RUM DOG DONT HE LOOK FIERCE AT ANY STRANGE COVE THAT LAUGHS OR SINGS WHEN HES IN COMPANY PURSUED THE DODGER WONT HE GROWL AT ALL WHEN HE HEARS A FIDDLE PLAYING AND DONT HE HATE OTHER DOGS AS AINT OF HIS BREED OH NO HES AN OUTANDOUT CHRISTIAN SAID CHARLEY THIS WAS MERELY INTENDED AS A TRIBUTE TO THE ANIMALS ABILITIES BUT IT WAS AN APPROPRIATE REMARK IN ANOTHER SENSE IF MASTER BATES HAD ONLY KNOWN IT FOR THERE ARE A GOOD MANY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN CLAIMING TO BE OUTANDOUT CHRISTIANS BETWEEN WHOM AND MR SIKES DOG THERE EXIST STRONG AND SINGULAR POINTS OF RESEMBLANCE WELL WELL SAID THE DODGER RECURRING TO THE POINT FROM WHICH THEY HAD STRAYED WITH THAT MINDFULNESS OF HIS PROFESSION WHICH INFLUENCED ALL HIS PROCEEDINGS THIS HASNT GO ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUNG GREEN HERE NO MORE IT HAS SAID CHARLEY WHY DONT YOU PUT YOURSELF UNDER

KNEW THIS TOO WELL BUT THINKING IT MIGHT BE DANGEROUS TO EXPRESS HIS FEELINGS MORE OPENLY HE ONLY SIGHED AND WENT ON WITH HIS BOOTCLEANING GO EXCLAIMED THE DODGER WHY WHERES YOUR SPIRIT DONT YOU TAKE ANY PRIDE OUT OF YOURSELF WOULD YOU GO AND BE DEPENDENT ON YOUR FRIENDS OH BLOW THAT SAID MASTER BATES DRAWING TWO OR THREE SILK HANDKERCHIEFS FROM HIS POCKET AND TOSSING THEM INTO A CUPBOARD THATS TOO MEAN THAT IS I COULDNT DO IT SAID THE DODGER WITH AN AIR OF HAUGHTY DISGUST YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR FRIENDS THOUGH SAID OLIVER WITH A HALF SMILE AND LET THEM BE PUNISHED FOR WHAT YOU DID THAT REJOINED THE DODGER WITH A WAVE OF HIS PIPE THAT WAS ALL OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR FAGIN CAUSE THE TRAPS KNOW THAT WE WORK TOGETHER AND HE MIGHT HAVE GOT INTO TROUBLE IF WE HADNT MADE OUR LUCKY THAT WAS THE MOVE WASNT IT CHARLEY MASTER BATES NODDED ASSENT AND WOULD HAVE SPOKEN BUT THE RECOLLECTION OF OLIVERS FLIGHT CAME SO SUDDENLY UPON HIM THAT THE SMOKE HE WAS INHALING GOT ENTANGLED WITH A LAUGH AND WENT UP INTO HIS HEAD AND DOWN INTO HIS THROAT AND BROUGHT ON A FIT OF COUGHING AND STAMPING ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LONG LOOK HERE SAID THE DODGER DRAWING FORTH A HANDFUL OF SHILLINGS AND HALFPENCE HERES

THIS ADVICE WITH SUNDRY MORAL ADMONITIONS OF HIS OWN WHICH BEING EXHAUSTED HE AND HIS FRIEND MR DAWKINS LAUNCHED INTO A GLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THE NUMEROUS PLEASURES INCIDENTAL TO THE LIFE THEY LED INTERSPERSED WITH A VARIETY OF HINTS TO OLIVER THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WOULD BE TO SECURE FAGINS FAVOUR WITHOUT MORE DELAY BY THE MEANS WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAD EMPLOYED TO GAIN IT AND ALWAYS PUT THIS IN YOUR PIPE NOLLY SAID THE DODGER AS THE JEW WAS HEARD UNLOCKING THE DOOR ABOVE IF YOU DONT TAKE FOGELS AND TICKERS WHATS THE GOOD OF TALKING IN THAT WAY INTERPOSED MASTER BATES HE DONT KNOW

HAD ENTERED UNSEEN BY OLIVER IT ALL LIES IN A NUTSHELL MY DEAR IN A NUTSHELL TAKE THE DODGERS WORD FOR IT HA HA HA HE UNDERSTANDS THE CATECHISM OF HIS TRADE THE OLD MAN RUBBED HIS HANDS GLEEFULLY TOGETHER AS HE CORROBORATED THE DODGERS REASONING IN THESE TERMS AND CHUCKLED WITH DELIGHT AT HIS PUPILS PROFICIENCY THE CONVERSATION PROCEEDED NO FARTHER AT THIS TIME FOR THE JEW HAD RETURNED HOME ACCOMPANIED BY MISS BETSY AND A GENTLEMAN WHOM OLIVER HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE BUT WHO WAS ACCOSTED BY THE DODGER AS TOM CHITLING AND WHO HAVING LINGERED ON THE STAIRS TO EXCHANGE A FEW GALLANTRIES WITH THE LADY NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE MR CHITLING WAS OLDER IN YEARS THAN THE DODGER HAVING PERHAPS NUMBERED EIGHTEEN WINTERS BUT THERE WAS A DEGREE OF DEFERENCE IN HIS DEPORTMENT TOWARDS THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHICH SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT HE FELT HIMSELF CONSCIOUS OF A SLIGHT INFERIORITY IN POINT OF GENIUS AND PROFESSIONAL AQUIREMENTS HE HAD SMALL TWINKLING EYES AND A POCKMARKED FACE WORE A FUR CAP A DARK CORDUROY JACKET GREASY FUSTIAN TROUSERS AND AN APRON HIS WARDROBE WAS IN TRUTH RATHER OUT OF REPAIR BUT HE EXCUSED HIMSELF TO THE COMPANY BY STATING THAT HIS TIME WAS ONLY OUT AN HOUR BEFORE AND THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING WORN THE REGIMENTALS FOR SIX WEEKS PAST HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BESTOW ANY ATTENTION ON HIS PRIVATE CLOTHES MR CHITLING ADDED WITH STRONG MARKS OF IRRITATION THAT THE NEW WAY OF FUMIGATING CLOTHES UP YONDER WAS INFERNAL UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR IT BURNT HOLES IN THEM AND THERE WAS NO REMEDY AGAINST THE COUNTY THE SAME REMARK HE CONSIDERED TO APPLY TO THE REGULATION MODE OF CUTTING THE HAIR WHICH HE HELD TO BE DECIDEDLY UNLAWFUL MR CHITLING WOUND UP HIS OBSERVATIONS BY STATING THAT HE HAD NOT TOUCHED A DROP OF ANYTHING FOR FORTYTWO MORAL LONG HARDWORKING DAYS AND THAT HE WISHED HE MIGHT BE BUSTED IF HE WARNT AS DRY AS A LIMEBASKET WHERE DO YOU THINK THE GENTLEMAN HAS COME FROM OLIVER INQUIRED THE JEW WITH A GRIN AS THE OTHER BOYS PUT A

FEATURES GRADUALLY TO RESOLVE THEMSELVES INTO A GHASTLY GRIN AND NODDING HIS HEAD LEFT THE ROOM OLIVER LEANED HIS HEAD UPON HIS HAND WHEN THE OLD MAN DISAPPEARED AND PONDERED WITH A TREMBLING HEART ON THE WORDS HE HAD JUST HEARD THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF THE JEWS ADMONITION THE MORE HE WAS AT A LOSS TO DIVINE ITS REAL PURPOSE AND MEANING HE COULD THINK OF NO BAD OBJECT TO BE ATTAINED BY SENDING HIM TO SIKES WHICH WOULD NOT BE EQUALLY WELL ANSWERED BY HIS REMAINING WITH FAGIN AND AFTER MEDITATING FOR A LONG TIME CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD BEEN SELECTED TO PERFORM SOME ORDINARY MENIAL OFFICES FOR THE HOUSEBREAKER UNTIL ANOTHER BOY BETTER SUITED FOR HIS PURPOSE COULD BE ENGAGED HE WAS TOO WELL ACCUSTOMED TO SUFFERING AND HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH WHERE HE WAS TO BEWAIL THE PROSPECT OF CHANGE VERY SEVERELY HE REMAINED LOST IN THOUGHT FOR SOME MINUTES AND THEN WITH A HEAVY SIGH SNUFFED THE CANDLE AND TAKING UP THE BOOK WHICH THE JEW HAD LEFT WITH HIM BEGAN TO READ HE TURNED OVER THE LEAVES CARELESSLY AT FIRST BUT LIGHTING ON A PASSAGE WHICH ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION HE SOON BECAME INTENT UPON THE VOLUME IT WAS A HISTORY OF THE LIVES AND TRIALS OF GREAT CRIMINALS AND THE PAGES WERE SOILED AND THUMBED WITH USE HERE HE READ OF DREADFUL CRIMES THAT MADE THE BLOOD RUN COLD OF SECRET MURDERS THAT HAD BEEN COMMITTED BY THE LONELY WAYSIDE OF BODIES HIDDEN FROM THE EYE OF MAN IN DEEP PITS AND WELLS WHICH WOULD NOT KEEP THEM DOWN DEEP AS THEY WERE BUT HAD YIELDED THEM UP AT LAST AFTER MANY YEARS AND SO MADDENED THE MURDERERS WITH THE SIGHT THAT IN THEIR HORROR THEY HAD CONFESSED THEIR GUILT AND YELLED FOR THE GIBBET TO END THEIR AGONY HERE TOO HE READ OF MEN WHO LYING IN THEIR BEDS AT DEAD OF NIGHT HAD BEEN TEMPTED SO THEY SAID AND LED ON BY THEIR OWN BAD THOUGHTS TO SUCH DREADFUL BLOODSHED AS IT MADE THE FLESH CREEP AND THE LIMBS QUAIL TO THINK OF THE TERRIBLE DESCRIPTIONS WERE SO REAL AND VIVID THAT THE SALLOW PAGES SEEMED TO TURN RED WITH GORE AND THE WORDS UPON THEM TO BE SOUNDED IN HIS EARS AS IF THEY WERE WHISPERED IN HOLLOW MURMURS BY THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD IN A PAROXYSM OF FEAR THE BOY CLOSED THE BOOK AND THRUST IT FROM HIM THEN FALLING UPON HIS KNEES HE PRAYED HEAVEN TO SPARE HIM FROM SUCH DEEDS AND RATHER TO WILL THAT HE SHOULD DIE AT ONCE THAN BE RESERVED FOR CRIMES SO FEARFUL AND APPALLING BY DEGREES HE GREW MORE CALM AND BESOUGHT IN A LOW AND BROKEN VOICE THAT HE MIGHT BE RESCUED FROM HIS PRESENT DANGERS AND THAT IF ANY AID WERE TO BE RAISED UP FOR A POOR OUTCAST BOY WHO HAD NEVER KNOWN THE LOVE OF FRIENDS OR KINDRED IT MIGHT COME TO HIM NOW WHEN

OVER HIS KNEES TO PREVENT THE CRUMBS FROM SULLYING THE SPLENDOUR OF HIS SHORTS BEGAN TO EAT AND DRINK VARYING THESE AMUSEMENTS OCCASIONALLY BY FETCHING A DEEP SIGH WHICH HOWEVER HAD NO INJURIOUS EFFECT UPON HIS APPETITE BUT ON THE CONTRARY RATHER SEEMED TO FACILITATE HIS OPERATIONS IN THE TEA AND TOAST DEPARTMENT YOU HAVE A CAT MAAM I SEE SAID MR BUMBLE GLANCING AT ONE WHO IN THE CENTRE OF

RESIGNED HIS CUP WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD SQUEEZED MRS CORNEYS LITTLE FINGER AS SHE TOOK IT AND INFLICTING TWO OPENHANDED SLAPS UPON HIS LACED WAISTCOAT GAVE A MIGHTY SIGH AND HITCHED HIS CHAIR A VERY LITTLE MORSEL FARTHER FROM THE FIRE IT WAS A ROUND TABLE AND AS MRS CORNEY AND MR BUMBLE HAD BEEN SITTING OPPOSITE EACH OTHER WITH NO GREAT SPACE BETWEEN THEM AND FRONTING THE FIRE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT MR BUMBLE IN RECEDING FROM THE FIRE AND STILL KEEPING AT THE TABLE INCREASED THE DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MRS CORNEY WHICH PROCEEDING SOME PRUDENT READERS WILL DOUBTLESS BE DISPOSED TO ADMIRE AND TO CONSIDER AN ACT OF GREAT HEROISM ON MR BUMBLES PART HE BEING IN SOME SORT TEMPTED BY TIME PLACE AND OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE UTTERANCE TO CERTAIN SOFT NOTHINGS WHICH HOWEVER WELL THEY MAY BECOME THE LIPS OF THE LIGHT AND THOUGHTLESS DO SEEM IMMEASURABLY BENEATH THE DIGNITY OF JUDGES OF THE LAND MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT MINISTERS OF STATE LORD MAYORS AND OTHER GREAT PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES BUT MORE PARTICULARLY BENEATH THE STATELINESS AND GRAVITY OF A BEADLE WHO AS IS WELL KNOWN SHOULD BE THE STERNEST AND MOST INFLEXIBLE AMONG THEM ALL WHATEVER WERE MR BUMBLES INTENTIONS HOWEVER AND NO DOUBT THEY WERE OF THE BEST IT UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENED AS HAS BEEN TWICE BEFORE REMARKED THAT THE TABLE WAS A ROUND ONE CONSEQUENTLY MR BUMBLE MOVING HIS CHAIR BY LITTLE AND LITTLE SOON BEGAN TO DIMINISH THE DISTANCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE MATRON AND CONTINUING TO TRAVEL ROUND THE OUTER EDGE OF THE CIRCLE BROUGHT HIS CHAIR IN TIME CLOSE TO THAT IN WHICH THE MATRON WAS SEATED INDEED THE TWO CHAIRS TOUCHED AND WHEN THEY DID SO MR BUMBLE STOPPED NOW IF THE MATRON HAD MOVED HER CHAIR TO THE RIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SCORCHED BY THE FIRE AND IF TO THE LEFT SHE MUST HAVE FALLEN INTO MR BUMBLES ARMS SO BEING A DISCREET MATRON AND NO DOUBT FORESEEING THESE CONSEQUENCES AT A GLANCE SHE REMAINED WHERE SHE WAS AND HANDED MR BUMBLE ANOTHER CUP OF TEA HARDHEARTED MRS CORNEY SAID MR BUMBLE STIRRING HIS TEA AND LOOKING UP INTO THE MATRONS FACE ARE YOU HARDHEARTED MRS CORNEY DEAR ME EXCLAIMED THE MATRON WHAT A VERY CURIOUS QUESTION FROM A SINGLE MAN WHAT CAN YOU WANT TO KNOW FOR MR BUMBLE THE BEADLE DRANK HIS TEA TO THE LAST DROP FINISHED A PIECE OF TOAST WHISKED THE CRUMBS OFF HIS KNEES WIPED HIS LIPS AND DELIBERATELY KISSED THE MATRON MR BUMBLE CRIED THAT DISCREET LADY IN A WHISPER FOR THE FRIGHT WAS SO GREAT THAT SHE HAD QUITE LOST HER VOICE MR BUMBLE I SHALL SCREAM MR BUMBLE MADE NO REPLY BUT IN A SLOW AND DIGNIFIED MANNER PUT HIS ARM ROUND THE MATRONS WAIST AS THE LADY HAD STATED HER INTENTION OF SCREAMING OF COURSE SHE WOULD HAVE SCREAMED AT THIS ADDITIONAL BOLDNESS BUT THAT THE EXERTION WAS RENDERED UNNECESSARY BY A HASTY KNOCKING AT THE DOOR WHICH WAS NO SOONER HEARD THAN MR BUMBLE DARTED WITH MUCH AGILITY TO THE WINE BOTTLES AND BEGAN DUSTING THEM WITH GREAT VIOLENCE WHILE THE MATRON SHARPLY DEMANDED WHO WAS THERE IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK AS A CURIOUS PHYSICAL INSTANCE OF THE EFFICACY OF A SUDDEN SURPRISE IN COUNTERACTING THE EFFECTS OF EXTREME FEAR THAT HER VOICE HAD QUITE RECOVERED ALL ITS OFFICIAL ASPERITY IF YOU PLEASE MISTRESS SAID A WITHERED OLD FEMALE PAUPER HIDEOUSLY UGLY PUTTING HER HEAD IN AT THE DOOR OLD SALLY IS AGOING FAST WELL WHATS THAT TO ME ANGRILY DEMANDED THE MATRON I CANT KEEP HER ALIVE CAN I NO NO MISTRESS REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN NOBODY CAN SHES FAR BEYOND

INVECTIVES AGAINST OLD WOMEN WHO COULDNT EVEN DIE WITHOUT PURPOSELY ANNOYING THEIR BETTERS AND MUFFLING HERSELF IN A THICK SHAWL WHICH SHE HASTILY CAUGHT UP BRIEFLY REQUESTED MR BUMBLE TO STAY TILL SHE CAME BACK LEST ANYTHING PARTICULAR SHOULD OCCUR BIDDING THE MESSENGER WALK FAST AND NOT BE ALL NIGHT HOBBLING UP THE STAIRS SHE FOLLOWED HER FROM THE ROOM WITH A VERY ILL GRACE SCOLDING ALL THE WAY MR BUMBLES CONDUCT ON BEING LEFT TO HIMSELF WAS RATHER INEXPLICABLE HE OPENED THE CLOSET COUNTED THE TEASPOONS WEIGHED THE SUGARTONGS CLOSELY INSPECTED A SILVER MILKPOT TO ASCERTAIN THAT IT WAS OF THE GENUINE METAL AND HAVING SATISFIED HIS CURIOSITY ON THESE POINTS PUT ON HIS COCKED HAT CORNERWISE AND DANCED WITH MUCH GRAVITY FOUR DISTINCT TIMES ROUND THE TABLE HAVING GONE THROUGH THIS VERY EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE HE TOOK OFF THE COCKED HAT AGAIN AND SPREADING HIMSELF BEFORE THE FIRE WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS IT SEEMED TO BE MENTALLY ENGAGED IN TAKING AN EXACT INVENTORY OF THE FURNITURE CHAPTER XXIV TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT BUT IS A SHORT ONE AND MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY IT WAS NO UNFIT MESSENGER OF DEATH WHO HAD DISTURBED THE QUIET OF THE MATRONS ROOM HER BODY WAS BENT BY AGE HER LIMBS TREMBLED WITH PALSY HER FACE DISTORTED INTO A MUMBLING LEER RESEMBLED MORE THE GROTESQUE SHAPING OF SOME WILD PENCIL THAN THE WORK OF NATURES HAND ALAS HOW FEW OF NATURES FACES ARE LEFT ALONE TO GLADDEN US WITH THEIR BEAUTY THE CARES AND SORROWS AND HUNGERINGS OF THE WORLD CHANGE THEM AS THEY CHANGE HEARTS AND IT IS ONLY WHEN THOSE PASSIONS SLEEP AND HAVE LOST THEIR HOLD FOR EVER THAT THE TROUBLED CLOUDS PASS OFF AND LEAVE HEAVENS SURFACE CLEAR IT IS A COMMON THING FOR THE COUNTENANCES OF THE DEAD EVEN IN THAT FIXED AND RIGID STATE TO SUBSIDE INTO THE LONGFORGOTTEN EXPRESSION OF SLEEPING INFANCY AND SETTLE INTO THE VERY LOOK OF EARLY LIFE SO CALM SO PEACEFUL DO THEY GROW AGAIN THAT THOSE WHO KNEW THEM IN THEIR HAPPY CHILDHOOD KNEEL BY THE COFFINS SIDE IN AWE AND SEE THE ANGEL EVEN UPON EARTH THE OLD CRONE TOTTERED ALONG THE PASSAGES AND UP THE STAIRS MUTTERING SOME INDISTINCT ANSWERS TO THE CHIDINGS OF HER COMPANION BEING AT LENGTH COMPELLED TO PAUSE FOR BREATH SHE GAVE THE LIGHT INTO HER HAND AND REMAINED BEHIND TO FOLLOW AS SHE MIGHT WHILE THE MORE NIMBLE SUPERIOR MADE HER WAY TO THE ROOM WHERE THE SICK WOMAN LAY IT WAS A BARE GARRETROOM WITH A DIM LIGHT BURNING AT THE FARTHER END THERE WAS ANOTHER OLD WOMAN WATCHING BY THE BED THE PARISH APOTHECARYS APPRENTICE WAS STANDING BY THE FIRE MAKING A TOOTHPICK OUT OF A QUILL COLD

MEANWHILE TO INTIMATE THAT THE WOMAN WOULD NOT DIE SO EASILY HAVING DONE SO SHE RESUMED HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF THE OTHER NURSE WHO HAD BY THIS TIME RETURNED THE MISTRESS WITH AN EXPRESSION OF IMPATIENCE WRAPPED HERSELF IN HER SHAWL AND SAT AT THE FOOT OF THE BED THE APOTHECARYS APPRENTICE HAVING COMPLETED THE MANUFACTURE OF THE TOOTHPICK PLANTED HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND MADE GOOD USE OF IT FOR TEN MINUTES OR SO WHEN APPARENTLY GROWING RATHER DULL HE WISHED MRS CORNEY JOY OF HER JOB AND TOOK HIMSELF OFF ON TIPTOE WHEN THEY HAD SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME TIME THE TWO OLD WOMEN ROSE FROM THE BED AND CROUCHING OVER THE FIRE HELD OUT THEIR WITHERED HANDS TO CATCH THE HEAT THE FLAME THREW A GHASTLY LIGHT ON THEIR SHRIVELLED FACES AND MADE THEIR UGLINESS APPEAR TERRIBLE AS IN THIS POSITION THEY BEGAN TO CONVERSE IN A LOW VOICE DID SHE SAY ANY MORE ANNY DEAR WHILE I WAS GONE INQUIRED THE MESSENGER NOT A WORD REPLIED THE OTHER SHE PLUCKED AND TORE AT HER ARMS FOR A LITTLE TIME

CHITLING ALL INTENT UPON A GAME OF WHIST THE ARTFUL TAKING DUMMY AGAINST MASTER BATES AND MR CHITLING THE COUNTENANCE OF THE FIRSTNAMED GENTLEMAN PECULIARLY INTELLIGENT AT ALL TIMES ACQUIRED GREAT ADDITIONAL INTEREST FROM HIS CLOSE OBSERVANCE OF THE GAME AND HIS ATTENTIVE PERUSAL OF MR CHITLINGS HAND UPON WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME AS OCCASION SERVED HE BESTOWED A VARIETY OF EARNEST GLANCES WISELY REGULATING HIS OWN PLAY BY THE RESULT OF HIS OBSERVATIONS UPON HIS NEIGHBOURS CARDS IT BEING A COLD NIGHT THE DODGER WORE HIS HAT AS INDEED WAS OFTEN HIS CUSTOM WITHIN DOORS HE ALSO SUSTAINED A CLAY

ACCOMMODATION OF THE COMPANY MASTER BATES WAS ALSO ATTENTIVE TO THE PLAY BUT BEING OF A MORE EXCITABLE NATURE THAN HIS ACCOMPLISHED FRIEND IT WAS OBSERVABLE THAT HE MORE FREQUENTLY APPLIED HIMSELF TO THE GINANDWATER AND MOREOVER INDULGED IN MANY JESTS AND IRRELEVANT REMARKS ALL HIGHLY UNBECOMING A SCIENTIFIC RUBBER INDEED THE ARTFUL PRESUMING UPON THEIR CLOSE ATTACHMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK OCCASION TO REASON GRAVELY WITH HIS COMPANION UPON THESE IMPROPRIETIES ALL OF WHICH REMONSTRANCES MASTER BATES RECEIVED IN EXTREMELY GOOD PART MERELY REQUESTING HIS FRIEND TO BE BLOWED OR TO INSERT HIS HEAD IN A SACK OR REPLYING WITH SOME OTHER NEATLYTURNED WITTICISM OF A SIMILAR KIND THE HAPPY APPLICATION OF WHICH EXCITED CONSIDERABLE ADMIRATION IN THE MIND OF MR CHITLING IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT

UNFORTUNATELY CHARLEY IN OPENING HIS MOUTH TO REPLY THAT HE WAS NEVER MORE SERIOUS IN HIS LIFE WAS UNABLE TO PREVENT THE ESCAPE OF SUCH A VIOLENT ROAR THAT THE ABUSED MR CHITLING WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY CEREMONIES RUSHED ACROSS THE ROOM AND AIMED A BLOW AT THE OFFENDER WHO BEING SKILFUL IN EVADING PURSUIT DUCKED TO AVOID IT AND CHOSE HIS TIME SO WELL THAT IT LIGHTED ON THE CHEST OF THE

THE POWER TO TO PANTING FOR BREATH THE OLD MAN STAMMERED FOR A WORD AND IN THAT INSTANT CHECKED THE TORRENT OF HIS WRATH AND CHANGED HIS WHOLE DEMEANOUR A MOMENT BEFORE HIS CLENCHED HANDS HAD GRASPED THE AIR HIS EYES HAD DILATED AND HIS FACE GROWN LIVID WITH PASSION BUT NOW HE SHRUNK INTO A CHAIR AND COWERING TOGETHER TREMBLED WITH THE APPREHENSION OF HAVING HIMSELF DISCLOSED SOME HIDDEN VILLAINY

GIRL HAD PROFITED BY HIS UNGUARDED HINTS BUT SHE ANSWERED THEM SO READILY AND WAS WITHAL SO UTTERLY UNMOVED BY HIS SEARCHING LOOKS THAT HIS ORIGINAL IMPRESSION OF HER BEING MORE THAN A TRIFLE IN LIQUOR WAS CONFIRMED NANCY INDEED WAS NOT EXEMPT FROM A FAILING WHICH WAS VERY COMMON AMONG THE JEWS FEMALE PUPILS AND IN WHICH IN THEIR TENDERER YEARS THEY WERE RATHER ENCOURAGED THAN CHECKED HER DISORDERED APPEARANCE AND A WHOLESALE PERFUME OF GENEVA WHICH PERVADED THE APARTMENT AFFORDED STRONG CONFIRMATORY EVIDENCE OF THE JUSTICE OF THE JEWS SUPPOSITION AND WHEN AFTER INDULGING IN THE TEMPORARY DISPLAY OF VIOLENCE ABOVE DESCRIBED SHE SUBSIDED FIRST INTO DULLNESS AND AFTERWARDS INTO A COMPOUND OF FEELINGS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF WHICH SHE SHED TEARS ONE MINUTE AND IN THE NEXT GAVE UTTERANCE TO VARIOUS EXCLAMATIONS OF NEVER SAY DIE AND DIVERS CALCULATIONS AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE THE AMOUNT OF THE ODDS SO LONG AS A LADY OR GENTLEMAN WAS HAPPY MR FAGIN WHO HAD HAD CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE OF SUCH MATTERS IN HIS TIME SAW WITH GREAT SATISFACTION THAT SHE WAS VERY FAR GONE INDEED HAVING EASED HIS MIND BY THIS DISCOVERY AND HAVING ACCOMPLISHED HIS TWOFOLD OBJECT OF IMPARTING TO THE GIRL WHAT HE HAD THAT NIGHT HEARD AND OF ASCERTAINING WITH HIS OWN EYES THAT SIKES HAD NOT RETURNED MR FAGIN AGAIN TURNED HIS FACE HOMEWARD LEAVING HIS YOUNG FRIEND ASLEEP WITH HER HEAD UPON THE TABLE IT WAS WITHIN AN HOUR OF MIDNIGHT THE WEATHER BEING DARK AND PIERCING COLD HE HAD NO GREAT TEMPTATION TO LOITER THE SHARP WIND THAT SCOURED THE STREETS SEEMED TO HAVE CLEARED THEM OF PASSENGERS AS OF DUST AND MUD FOR FEW PEOPLE WERE ABROAD AND THEY WERE TO ALL APPEARANCE HASTENING FAST HOME IT BLEW FROM THE RIGHT QUARTER FOR THE JEW HOWEVER AND STRAIGHT BEFORE IT HE WENT TREMBLING AND SHIVERING AS EVERY FRESH GUST DROVE HIM RUDELY ON HIS WAY HE HAD REACHED THE CORNER OF HIS OWN STREET AND WAS ALREADY FUMBLING IN HIS POCKET FOR THE DOORKEY WHEN A DARK FIGURE EMERGED FROM A PROJECTING ENTRANCE WHICH LAY IN DEEP SHADOW AND CROSSING THE ROAD GLIDED UP TO HIM UNPERCEIVED FAGIN WHISPERED A VOICE CLOSE TO HIS EAR AH SAID THE JEW TURNING QUICKLY ROUND IS THAT YES INTERRUPTED THE STRANGER I HAVE BEEN LINGERING HERE THESE TWO HOURS WHERE THE DEVIL HAVE YOU BEEN ON YOUR BUSINESS MY DEAR REPLIED THE JEW GLANCING UNEASILY AT HIS COMPANION AND SLACKENING HIS PACE AS HE SPOKE ON YOUR BUSINESS ALL NIGHT OH OF COURSE SAID THE STRANGER WITH A SNEER WELL AND WHATS COME OF IT NOTHING GOOD SAID THE JEW NOTHING BAD I HOPE SAID THE STRANGER STOPPING SHORT AND TURNING A STARTLED LOOK ON HIS COMPANION THE JEW SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WAS ABOUT TO REPLY WHEN THE STRANGER INTERRUPTING HIM MOTIONED TO THE HOUSE BEFORE WHICH THEY HAD BY THIS TIME ARRIVED REMARKING THAT HE HAD BETTER SAY WHAT HE HAD GOT TO SAY UNDER COVER FOR HIS BLOOD WAS CHILLED WITH STANDING ABOUT SO LONG AND THE WIND BLEW THROUGH HIM FAGIN LOOKED AS IF HE COULD HAVE WILLINGLY EXCUSED HIMSELF FROM TAKING HOME A VISITOR AT THAT UNSEASONABLE HOUR AND INDEED MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING NO FIRE BUT HIS COMPANION REPEATING HIS REQUEST IN A PEREMPTORY MANNER HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND REQUESTED HIM TO CLOSE IT SOFTLY WHILE HE GOT A LIGHT ITS AS DARK AS THE GRAVE SAID THE MAN GROPING FORWARD A FEW STEPS MAKE HASTE SHUT THE DOOR WHISPERED FAGIN FROM THE END OF THE PASSAGE AS HE SPOKE IT CLOSED WITH A LOUD NOISE THAT WASNT MY DOING SAID THE OTHER MAN FEELING HIS WAY THE WIND BLEW IT TO OR IT SHUT OF ITS OWN ACCORD ONE OR THE OTHER LOOK SHARP WITH THE LIGHT OR I SHALL KNOCK MY BRAINS OUT AGAINST SOMETHING IN THIS CONFOUNDED HOLE FAGIN STEALTHILY DESCENDED THE KITCHEN STAIRS AFTER A SHORT ABSENCE HE RETURNED WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT TOBY CRACKIT WAS ASLEEP IN THE BACK ROOM BELOW AND THAT THE BOYS WERE IN THE FRONT ONE BECKONING THE MAN TO FOLLOW HIM HE LED THE WAY UPSTAIRS WE CAN SAY THE FEW WORDS WEVE GOT TO SAY IN HERE MY DEAR SAID THE JEW THROWING OPEN A DOOR ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND AS THERE ARE HOLES IN THE SHUTTERS AND WE NEVER SHOW LIGHTS TO OUR NEIGHBOURS WELL SET THE CANDLE ON THE STAIRS THERE WITH THOSE WORDS THE JEW STOOPING DOWN PLACED THE CANDLE ON AN UPPER FLIGHT OF STAIRS EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THE ROOM DOOR THIS DONE HE LED THE WAY INTO THE APARTMENT WHICH WAS DESTITUTE OF ALL MOVABLES SAVE A BROKEN ARMCHAIR AND AN OLD COUCH OR SOFA WITHOUT COVERING WHICH STOOD BEHIND THE DOOR UPON THIS PIECE OF FURNITURE THE STRANGER SAT HIMSELF WITH THE AIR OF A WEARY MAN AND THE JEW DRAWING UP THE ARMCHAIR OPPOSITE THEY SAT FACE TO FACE IT WAS NOT QUITE DARK THE DOOR WAS PARTIALLY OPEN AND THE CANDLE OUTSIDE THREW A FEEBLE REFLECTION ON THE OPPOSITE WALL THEY CONVERSED FOR SOME TIME IN WHISPERS THOUGH NOTHING OF THE CONVERSATION WAS DISTINGUISHABLE BEYOND A FEW DISJOINTED WORDS HERE AND THERE A LISTENER MIGHT EASILY HAVE PERCEIVED THAT FAGIN APPEARED TO BE DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST SOME REMARKS OF THE STRANGER AND THAT THE LATTER WAS IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE IRRITATION THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN TALKING THUS FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR MORE WHEN MONKSBY WHICH NAME THE JEW HAD DESIGNATED THE STRANGE MAN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE COURSE OF THEIR COLLOQUYSAID RAISING HIS VOICE A LITTLE I TELL YOU AGAIN IT WAS BADLY PLANNED WHY NOT HAVE KEPT HIM HERE AMONG THE REST AND MADE A SNEAKING SNIVELLING PICKPOCKET OF HIM AT ONCE ONLY HEAR HIM EXCLAIMED THE JEW SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS WHY DO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU COULDNT HAVE DONE IT IF YOU HAD CHOSEN DEMANDED MONKS STERNLY HAVENT YOU DONE IT WITH OTHER BOYS SCORES OF TIMES IF YOU HAD HAD PATIENCE FOR A TWELVEMONTH AT MOST COULDNT YOU HAVE GOT HIM CONVICTED AND SENT SAFELY OUT OF THE KINGDOM PERHAPS FOR LIFE WHOSE TURN WOULD THAT HAVE SERVED MY DEAR INQUIRED THE JEW HUMBLY MINE REPLIED MONKS BUT NOT MINE SAID THE JEW SUBMISSIVELY HE MIGHT HAVE BECOME OF USE TO ME WHEN THERE ARE TWO PARTIES TO A BARGAIN IT IS ONLY REASONABLE THAT THE INTERESTS OF BOTH SHOULD BE CONSULTED IS IT MY GOOD FRIEND WHAT THEN DEMANDED MONKS I SAW IT WAS NOT EASY TO TRAIN HIM TO THE BUSINESS REPLIED THE JEW HE WAS NOT LIKE OTHER BOYS IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES CURSE HIM NO MUTTERED THE MAN OR HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A THIEF LONG AGO I HAD NO HOLD UPON HIM TO MAKE HIM WORSE PURSUED THE JEW ANXIOUSLY WATCHING THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS COMPANION HIS HAND WAS NOT IN I HAD NOTHING TO FRIGHTEN HIM WITH WHICH WE ALWAYS MUST HAVE IN THE BEGINNING OR WE LABOUR IN VAIN WHAT COULD I DO SEND HIM OUT WITH THE DODGER AND CHARLEY WE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT AT FIRST MY DEAR I TREMBLED FOR US ALL THAT WAS NOT MY DOING OBSERVED MONKS NO NO MY DEAR RENEWED THE JEW AND I DONT QUARREL WITH IT NOW BECAUSE IF IT HAD NEVER HAPPENED YOU MIGHT NEVER HAVE CLAPPED EYES ON THE BOY TO NOTICE HIM AND SO LED TO THE DISCOVERY THAT IT WAS HIM YOU WERE LOOKING FOR WELL I GOT HIM BACK FOR YOU BY MEANS OF THE GIRL AND THEN SHE BEGINS TO FAVOUR HIM THROTTLE THE GIRL SAID MONKS IMPATIENTLY WHY WE CANT AFFORD TO DO THAT JUST NOW MY DEAR REPLIED THE JEW SMILING AND BESIDES THAT SORT OF THING IS NOT IN OUR WAY OR ONE OF THESE DAYS I MIGHT BE GLAD TO HAVE IT DONE I KNOW WHAT THESE GIRLS ARE MONKS WELL AS SOON AS THE BOY BEGINS TO HARDEN SHELL CARE NO MORE FOR HIM THAN FOR A BLOCK OF WOOD YOU WANT HIM MADE A THIEF IF HE IS ALIVE I CAN MAKE HIM ONE FROM THIS TIME AND IFIF SAID THE JEW DRAWING NEARER TO THE OTHERITS NOT LIKELY MINDBUT IF THE WORST COMES TO THE WORST AND HE IS DEAD ITS NO FAULT OF MINE IF HE IS INTERPOSED THE OTHER MAN WITH A LOOK OF TERROR AND CLASPING THE JEWS ARM WITH TREMBLING HANDS MIND THAT FAGIN I HAD NO HAND IN IT ANYTHING BUT HIS DEATH I TOLD YOU FROM THE FIRST I WONT SHED BLOOD ITS ALWAYS FOUND OUT AND HAUNTS A MAN BESIDES IF THEY SHOT HIM DEAD I WAS NOT THE CAUSE DO YOU HEAR ME FIRE THIS INFERNAL DEN WHATS THAT WHAT CRIED THE JEW GRASPING THE COWARD ROUND THE BODY WITH BOTH ARMS AS HE SPRUNG TO HIS FEET WHERE YONDER REPLIED THE MAN GLARING AT THE OPPOSITE WALL THE SHADOW I SAW THE SHADOW OF A WOMAN IN A CLOAK AND BONNET PASS ALONG THE WAINSCOT LIKE A BREATH THE JEW RELEASED HIS HOLD AND THEY RUSHED TUMULTUOUSLY FROM THE ROOM THE CANDLE WASTED BY THE DRAUGHT WAS STANDING WHERE IT HAD BEEN PLACED IT SHOWED THEM ONLY THE EMPTY STAIRCASE AND THEIR OWN WHITE FACES THEY LISTENED INTENTLY A PROFOUND SILENCE REIGNED THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE ITS YOUR FANCY SAID THE JEW TAKING UP THE LIGHT AND TURNING TO HIS COMPANION ILL SWEAR I SAW IT REPLIED MONKS TREMBLING IT WAS BENDING FORWARD WHEN I SAW IT FIRST AND WHEN I SPOKE IT DARTED AWAY THE JEW GLANCED CONTEMPTUOUSLY AT THE PALE FACE OF HIS ASSOCIATE AND TELLING HIM HE COULD FOLLOW IF HE PLEASED ASCENDED THE STAIRS THEY LOOKED INTO ALL THE ROOMS THEY WERE COLD BARE AND EMPTY THEY DESCENDED INTO THE PASSAGE AND THENCE INTO THE CELLARS BELOW THE GREEN DAMP HUNG UPON THE LOW WALLS THE TRACKS OF THE SNAIL AND SLUG GLISTENED IN THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLE BUT ALL WAS STILL AS DEATH WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW SAID THE JEW WHEN THEY HAD REGAINED THE PASSAGE BESIDES OURSELVES THERES NOT A CREATURE IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT TOBY AND THE BOYS AND THEYRE SAFE ENOUGH SEE HERE AS A PROOF OF THE FACT THE JEW DREW FORTH TWO KEYS FROM HIS POCKET AND EXPLAINED THAT WHEN HE FIRST WENT DOWNSTAIRS HE HAD LOCKED THEM IN TO PREVENT ANY INTRUSION ON THE CONFERENCE THIS ACCUMULATED TESTIMONY EFFECTUALLY STAGGERED MR MONKS HIS PROTESTATIONS HAD GRADUALLY BECOME LESS AND LESS VEHEMENT AS THEY PROCEEDED IN THEIR SEARCH WITHOUT MAKING ANY DISCOVERY AND NOW HE GAVE VENT TO SEVERAL VERY GRIM LAUGHS AND CONFESSED IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN HIS EXCITED IMAGINATION HE DECLINED ANY RENEWAL OF THE CONVERSATION HOWEVER FOR THAT NIGHT SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THAT IT WAS PAST ONE OCLOCK AND SO THE AMIABLE COUPLE PARTED CHAPTER XXVII ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER WHICH DESERTED A LADY MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY AS IT WOULD BE BY NO MEANS SEEMLY IN A HUMBLE AUTHOR TO KEEP SO MIGHTY A PERSONAGE AS A BEADLE WAITING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE AND THE SKIRTS OF HIS COAT GATHERED UP UNDER HIS ARMS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS IT MIGHT SUIT HIS PLEASURE TO RELIEVE HIM AND AS IT WOULD STILL LESS BECOME HIS STATION OR HIS GALLANTRY TO INVOLVE IN THE SAME NEGLECT A LADY ON WHOM

AS I WAS CLIMBING OVER IT BY A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THE OTHER TWO HAD BEEN VISITED WITH THE SAME UNPLEASANT SENSATION AT THAT PRECISE MOMENT IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS THEREFORE THAT IT WAS THE GATE ESPECIALLY AS THERE WAS NO DOUBT REGARDING THE TIME AT WHICH THE CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE BECAUSE ALL THREE REMEMBERED THAT THEY HAD COME IN SIGHT OF THE ROBBERS AT THE INSTANT OF ITS OCCURANCE THIS DIALOGUE WAS HELD BETWEEN THE TWO MEN WHO HAD SURPRISED THE BURGLARS AND A TRAVELLING TINKER WHO HAD BEEN SLEEPING IN AN OUTHOUSE AND WHO HAD BEEN ROUSED TOGETHER WITH HIS TWO MONGREL CURS TO JOIN IN THE PURSUIT MR GILES ACTED IN THE DOUBLE CAPACITY OF BUTLER AND STEWARD TO THE OLD LADY OF THE MANSION BRITTLES WAS A LAD OF ALLWORK WHO HAVING ENTERED HER SERVICE A MERE CHILD WAS TREATED AS A PROMISING YOUNG BOY STILL THOUGH HE WAS SOMETHING PAST THIRTY ENCOURAGING EACH OTHER WITH SUCH CONVERSE AS THIS BUT KEEPING VERY CLOSE TOGETHER NOTWITHSTANDING AND LOOKING APPREHENSIVELY ROUND WHENEVER A FRESH GUST RATTLED THROUGH THE BOUGHS THE THREE MEN HURRIED BACK TO A TREE BEHIND WHICH THEY HAD LEFT THEIR LANTERN LEST ITS LIGHT SHOULD INFORM THE THIEVES IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FIRE CATCHING UP THE LIGHT THEY MADE THE BEST OF THEIR WAY HOME AT A GOOD ROUND TROT AND LONG AFTER THEIR DUSKY FORMS HAD CEASED TO BE DISCERNIBLE THE LIGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN TWINKLING AND DANCING IN THE DISTANCE LIKE SOME EXHALATION OF THE DAMP AND GLOOMY ATMOSPHERE THROUGH WHICH IT WAS SWIFTLY BORNE THE AIR GREW COLDER AS DAY CAME SLOWLY ON AND THE MIST ROLLED ALONG THE GROUND LIKE A DENSE CLOUD OF SMOKE THE GRASS WAS WET THE PATHWAYS AND LOW PLACES WERE ALL MIRE AND WATER THE DAMP BREATH OF AN UNWHOLESOME WIND WENT LANGUIDLY BY WITH A HOLLOW MOANING STILL OLIVER LAY MOTIONLESS AND INSENSIBLE ON THE SPOT WHERE SIKES HAD LEFT HIM MORNING DREW ON APACE THE AIR BECOME MORE SHARP AND PIERCING AS ITS FIRST DULL HUETHE DEATH OF NIGHT RATHER THAN THE BIRTH OF DAYGLIMMERED FAINTLY IN THE SKY THE OBJECTS WHICH HAD LOOKED DIM AND TERRIBLE IN THE DARKNESS GREW MORE AND MORE DEFINED AND GRADUALLY RESOLVED INTO THEIR FAMILIAR SHAPES THE RAIN CAME DOWN THICK AND FAST AND PATTERED NOISILY AMONG THE LEAFLESS BUSHES BUT OLIVER FELT IT NOT AS IT BEAT AGAINST HIM FOR HE STILL LAY STRETCHED HELPLESS AND UNCONSCIOUS ON HIS BED OF CLAY AT LENGTH A LOW CRY OF PAIN BROKE THE STILLNESS THAT PREVAILED AND UTTERING IT THE BOY AWOKE HIS LEFT ARM RUDELY BANDAGED IN A SHAWL HUNG HEAVY AND USELESS AT HIS SIDE THE BANDAGE WAS SATURATED WITH BLOOD HE WAS SO WEAK THAT HE COULD SCARCELY RAISE HIMSELF INTO A SITTING POSTURE WHEN HE HAD DONE SO HE LOOKED FEEBLY ROUND FOR HELP AND GROANED WITH PAIN TREMBLING IN EVERY JOINT FROM COLD AND EXHAUSTION HE MADE AN EFFORT TO STAND UPRIGHT BUT SHUDDERING FROM HEAD TO FOOT FELL PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND AFTER A SHORT RETURN OF THE STUPOR IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN SO LONG PLUNGED OLIVER URGED BY A CREEPING SICKNESS AT HIS HEART WHICH SEEMED TO WARN HIM THAT IF HE LAY THERE HE MUST SURELY DIE GOT UPON HIS FEET AND ESSAYED TO WALK HIS HEAD WAS DIZZY AND HE STAGGERED TO AND FRO LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN BUT HE KEPT UP NEVERTHELESS AND WITH HIS HEAD DROOPING LANGUIDLY ON HIS BREAST WENT STUMBLING ONWARD HE KNEW NOT WHITHER AND NOW HOSTS OF BEWILDERING AND CONFUSED IDEAS CAME CROWDING ON HIS MIND HE SEEMED TO BE STILL WALKING BETWEEN SIKES AND CRACKIT WHO WERE ANGRILY DISPUTINGFOR THE VERY WORDS THEY SAID SOUNDED IN HIS EARS AND WHEN HE CAUGHT HIS OWN ATTENTION AS IT WERE BY MAKING SOME VIOLENT EFFORT TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM FALLING HE FOUND THAT HE WAS TALKING TO THEM THEN HE WAS ALONE WITH SIKES PLODDING ON AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND AS SHADOWY PEOPLE PASSED THEM HE FELT THE ROBBERS GRASP UPON HIS WRIST SUDDENLY HE STARTED BACK AT THE REPORT OF FIREARMS THERE ROSE INTO THE AIR LOUD CRIES AND SHOUTS LIGHTS GLEAMED BEFORE HIS EYES ALL WAS NOISE AND TUMULT AS SOME UNSEEN HAND BORE HIM HURRIEDLY AWAY THROUGH ALL THESE RAPID VISIONS THERE RAN AN UNDEFINED UNEASY CONSCIOUSNESS OF PAIN WHICH WEARIED AND TORMENTED HIM INCESSANTLY THUS HE STAGGERED ON CREEPING ALMOST MECHANICALLY BETWEEN THE BARS OF GATES OR THROUGH HEDGEGAPS AS THEY CAME IN HIS WAY UNTIL HE REACHED A ROAD HERE THE RAIN BEGAN TO FALL SO HEAVILY THAT IT ROUSED HIM HE LOOKED ABOUT AND SAW THAT AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE WAS A HOUSE WHICH PERHAPS HE COULD REACH PITYING HIS CONDITION THEY MIGHT HAVE COMPASSION ON HIM AND IF THEY DID NOT IT WOULD BE BETTER HE THOUGHT TO DIE NEAR HUMAN BEINGS THAN IN THE LONELY OPEN FIELDS HE SUMMONED UP ALL HIS STRENGTH FOR ONE LAST TRIAL AND BENT HIS FALTERING STEPS TOWARDS IT AS HE DREW NEARER TO THIS HOUSE A FEELING COME OVER HIM THAT HE HAD SEEN IT BEFORE HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF ITS DETAILS BUT THE SHAPE AND ASPECT OF THE BUILDING SEEMED FAMILIAR TO HIM THAT GARDEN WALL ON THE GRASS INSIDE HE HAD FALLEN ON HIS KNEES LAST NIGHT AND PRAYED THE TWO MENS MERCY IT WAS THE VERY HOUSE THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO ROB OLIVER FELT SUCH FEAR COME OVER HIM WHEN HE RECOGNISED THE PLACE THAT FOR THE INSTANT HE FORGOT THE AGONY OF HIS WOUND AND THOUGHT ONLY OF FLIGHT FLIGHT HE COULD SCARCELY STAND AND IF HE WERE IN FULL POSSESSION OF ALL THE BEST POWERS OF HIS SLIGHT AND YOUTHFUL FRAME WHITHER COULD HE FLY HE PUSHED AGAINST THE GARDENGATE IT WAS UNLOCKED AND SWUNG OPEN ON ITS HINGES HE TOTTERED ACROSS THE LAWN CLIMBED THE STEPS KNOCKED FAINTLY AT THE DOOR AND HIS WHOLE STRENGTH FAILING HIM SUNK DOWN AGAINST ONE OF THE PILLARS OF THE LITTLE PORTICO IT HAPPENED THAT ABOUT THIS TIME MR GILES BRITTLES AND THE TINKER WERE RECRUITING THEMSELVES

WONT TO DEPORT HIMSELF WITH A LOFTY AFFABILITY WHICH WHILE IT GRATIFIED COULD NOT FAIL TO REMIND THEM OF HIS SUPERIOR POSITION IN SOCIETY BUT DEATH FIRES AND BURGLARY MAKE ALL MEN EQUALS SO MR GILES SAT WITH HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT BEFORE THE KITCHEN FENDER LEANING HIS LEFT ARM ON THE TABLE WHILE WITH HIS RIGHT HE ILLUSTRATED A CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND MINUTE ACCOUNT OF THE ROBBERY TO WHICH HIS BEARERS

WOMAN CHAPTER XXIX HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTED IN A HANDSOME ROOM THOUGH ITS FURNITURE HAD RATHER THE AIR OF OLDFASHIONED COMFORT THAN OF MODERN ELEGANCE THERE SAT TWO LADIES AT A WELLSPREAD BREAKFASTTABLE MR GILES DRESSED WITH SCRUPULOUS CARE IN A FULL SUIT OF BLACK WAS IN ATTENDANCE UPON THEM HE HAD TAKEN HIS STATION SOME HALFWAY BETWEEN THE SIDEBOARD AND THE BREAKFASTTABLE AND WITH HIS BODY DRAWN UP TO ITS FULL HEIGHT HIS HEAD THROWN BACK AND INCLINED THE MEREST TRIFLE ON ONE SIDE HIS LEFT LEG ADVANCED AND HIS RIGHT HAND THRUST INTO HIS WAISTCOAT WHILE HIS LEFT HUNG DOWN BY HIS SIDE GRASPING A WAITER LOOKED LIKE ONE WHO LABOURED UNDER A VERY AGREEABLE SENSE OF HIS OWN MERITS AND IMPORTANCE OF THE TWO LADIES ONE WAS WELL ADVANCED IN YEARS BUT THE HIGHBACKED OAKEN CHAIR IN WHICH SHE SAT WAS NOT MORE UPRIGHT THAN SHE DRESSED WITH THE UTMOST NICETY AND PRECISION IN A QUAINT MIXTURE OF BYGONE COSTUME WITH SOME SLIGHT CONCESSIONS TO THE PREVAILING TASTE WHICH RATHER SERVED TO POINT THE OLD STYLE PLEASANTLY THAN TO IMPAIR ITS EFFECT SHE SAT IN A STATELY MANNER WITH HER HANDS FOLDED ON THE TABLE BEFORE HER HER EYES AND AGE HAD DIMMED BUT LITTLE OF THEIR BRIGHTNESS WERE ATTENTIVELY UPON HER YOUNG COMPANION THE YOUNGER LADY WAS IN THE LOVELY BLOOM AND SPRINGTIME OF WOMANHOOD AT THAT AGE WHEN IF EVER ANGELS BE FOR GODS GOOD PURPOSES ENTHRONED IN MORTAL FORMS THEY MAY BE WITHOUT IMPIETY SUPPOSED TO ABIDE IN SUCH AS HERS SHE WAS NOT PAST SEVENTEEN CAST IN SO SLIGHT AND EXQUISITE A MOULD SO MILD AND GENTLE SO PURE AND BEAUTIFUL THAT EARTH SEEMED NOT HER ELEMENT NOR ITS ROUGH CREATURES HER FIT COMPANIONS THE VERY INTELLIGENCE THAT SHONE IN HER DEEP BLUE EYE AND WAS STAMPED UPON HER NOBLE HEAD SEEMED SCARCELY OF HER AGE OR OF THE WORLD AND YET THE CHANGING EXPRESSION OF SWEETNESS AND GOOD HUMOUR THE THOUSAND LIGHTS THAT PLAYED ABOUT THE FACE AND LEFT NO SHADOW THERE ABOVE ALL THE SMILE THE CHEERFUL HAPPY SMILE WERE MADE FOR HOME AND FIRESIDE PEACE AND HAPPINESS SHE WAS BUSILY ENGAGED IN THE LITTLE OFFICES OF THE TABLE CHANCING TO RAISE HER EYES AS THE ELDER LADY WAS REGARDING HER SHE PLAYFULLY PUT BACK HER HAIR WHICH WAS SIMPLY BRAIDED ON HER FOREHEAD AND THREW INTO HER BEAMING LOOK SUCH AN EXPRESSION OF AFFECTION AND ARTLESS LOVELINESS THAT BLESSED SPIRITS MIGHT HAVE SMILED TO LOOK UPON HER AND BRITTLES HAS BEEN GONE UPWARDS OF AN HOUR HAS HE ASKED THE OLD LADY AFTER A PAUSE AN HOUR AND TWELVE MINUTES MAAM REPLIED MR GILES REFERRING TO A SILVER WATCH WHICH HE DREW FORTH BY A BLACK RIBBON HE IS ALWAYS SLOW REMARKED THE OLD LADY BRITTLES ALWAYS WAS A SLOW BOY MAAM REPLIED THE ATTENDANT AND SEEING BY THE BYE THAT BRITTLES HAD BEEN A SLOW BOY FOR UPWARDS OF THIRTY YEARS THERE APPEARED NO GREAT PROBABILITY OF HIS EVER BEING A FAST ONE HE GETS WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER I THINK SAID THE ELDER LADY IT IS VERY INEXCUSABLE IN HIM IF HE STOPS TO PLAY WITH ANY OTHER BOYS SAID THE YOUNG LADY SMILING MR GILES WAS APPARENTLY CONSIDERING THE PROPRIETY OF INDULGING IN A RESPECTFUL SMILE HIMSELF WHEN A GIG DROVE UP TO THE GARDENGATE OUT OF WHICH THERE JUMPED A FAT GENTLEMAN WHO RAN STRAIGHT UP TO THE DOOR AND WHO GETTING QUICKLY INTO THE HOUSE BY SOME MYSTERIOUS PROCESS BURST INTO THE ROOM AND NEARLY OVERTURNED MR GILES AND THE BREAKFASTTABLE TOGETHER I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING EXCLAIMED THE FAT GENTLEMAN MY DEAR MRS MAYLIEBLESS MY SOULIN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT TOOI NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING WITH THESE EXPRESSIONS OF CONDOLENCE THE FAT GENTLEMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOTH LADIES AND

THAT HONOUR HONOUR EH SAID THE DOCTOR WELL I DONT KNOW PERHAPS ITS AS HONOURABLE TO HIT A THIEF IN A BACK KITCHEN AS TO HIT YOUR MAN AT TWELVE PACES FANCY THAT HE FIRED IN THE AIR AND YOUVE FOUGHT A DUEL GILES MR GILES WHO THOUGHT THIS LIGHT TREATMENT OF THE MATTER AN UNJUST ATTEMPT AT DIMINISHING HIS GLORY ANSWERED RESPECTFULLY THAT IT WAS NOT FOR THE LIKE OF HIM TO JUDGE ABOUT THAT BUT HE

TIMES THAT SPACE BY ANY EXPLORER ALIVE THE DOCTOR WAS ABSENT MUCH LONGER THAN EITHER HE OR THE LADIES HAD ANTICIPATED A LARGE FLAT BOX WAS FETCHED OUT OF THE GIG AND A BEDROOM BELL WAS RUNG VERY OFTEN AND THE SERVANTS RAN UP AND DOWN STAIRS PERPETUALLY FROM WHICH TOKENS IT WAS JUSTLY CONCLUDED THAT SOMETHING IMPORTANT WAS GOING ON ABOVE AT LENGTH HE RETURNED AND IN REPLY TO AN ANXIOUS INQUIRY AFTER

HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HIM NO I BEG YOUR PARDON MAAM INTERPOSED MR GILES BUT I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT HIM WHEN DOCTOR LOSBERNE CAME IN THE FACT WAS THAT MR GILES HAD NOT AT FIRST BEEN ABLE TO BRING HIS MIND TO THE AVOWAL THAT HE HAD ONLY SHOT A BOY SUCH COMMENDATIONS HAD BEEN BESTOWED UPON HIS BRAVERY THAT HE COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OF HIM HELP POSTPONING THE EXPLANATION FOR A FEW DELICIOUS MINUTES DURING WHICH HE HAD FLOURISHED IN THE VERY ZENITH OF A BRIEF REPUTATION FOR UNDAUNTED COURAGE ROSE WISHED TO SEE THE MAN SAID MRS MAYLIE BUT I WOULDNT HEAR OF IT HUMPH REJOINED THE DOCTOR

PLEDGE YOU MY HONOUR CHAPTER XXX RELATES WHAT OLIVERS NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM WITH MANY LOQUACIOUS ASSURANCES THAT THEY WOULD BE AGREEABLY SURPRISED IN THE ASPECT OF THE CRIMINAL THE DOCTOR DREW THE YOUNG LADYS ARM THROUGH ONE OF HIS AND OFFERING HIS DISENGAGED HAND TO MRS MAYLIE LED THEM WITH MUCH CEREMONY AND STATELINESS UPSTAIRS NOW SAID THE DOCTOR IN A WHISPER AS HE SOFTLY TURNED THE HANDLE OF A BEDROOMDOOR LET US HEAR WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM HE HAS NOT BEEN SHAVED VERY RECENTLY BUT HE DONT LOOK AT ALL FEROCIOUS NOTWITHSTANDING STOP THOUGH LET ME FIRST SEE THAT HE IS IN VISITING ORDER STEPPING BEFORE THEM HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM MOTIONING THEM TO ADVANCE HE CLOSED THE DOOR WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED AND GENTLY DREW BACK THE CURTAINS OF THE BED UPON IT IN LIEU OF THE DOGGED BLACKVISAGED RUFFIAN THEY HAD EXPECTED TO BEHOLD THERE LAY A MERE CHILD WORN WITH PAIN AND EXHAUSTION AND SUNK INTO A DEEP SLEEP HIS WOUNDED ARM BOUND AND SPLINTERED UP WAS CROSSED UPON HIS BREAST HIS HEAD RECLINED UPON THE OTHER ARM WHICH WAS HALF HIDDEN BY HIS LONG HAIR AS IT STREAMED OVER THE PILLOW THE HONEST GENTLEMAN HELD THE CURTAIN IN HIS HAND AND LOOKED ON FOR A MINUTE OR SO IN SILENCE WHILST HE WAS WATCHING THE PATIENT THUS THE YOUNGER LADY GLIDED SOFTLY PAST AND SEATING HERSELF IN A CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE GATHERED OLIVERS HAIR FROM HIS FACE AS SHE STOOPED OVER HIM HER TEARS FELL UPON HIS FOREHEAD THE BOY STIRRED AND SMILED IN HIS SLEEP AS THOUGH THESE MARKS OF PITY AND COMPASSION HAD AWAKENED SOME PLEASANT DREAM OF A LOVE AND AFFECTION HE HAD NEVER KNOWN THUS A STRAIN OF GENTLE MUSIC OR THE RIPPLING OF WATER IN A SILENT PLACE OR THE ODOUR OF A FLOWER OR THE MENTION OF A FAMILIAR WORD WILL SOMETIMES CALL UP SUDDEN DIM REMEMBRANCES OF SCENES THAT NEVER WERE IN THIS LIFE WHICH VANISH LIKE A BREATH WHICH SOME BRIEF MEMORY OF A HAPPIER EXISTENCE LONG GONE BY WOULD SEEM TO HAVE AWAKENED WHICH NO VOLUNTARY EXERTION OF THE MIND CAN EVER RECALL WHAT CAN THIS MEAN EXCLAIMED THE ELDER LADY THIS POOR CHILD CAN NEVER HAVE BEEN THE PUPIL OF ROBBERS VICE SAID THE SURGEON REPLACING THE CURTAIN TAKES UP HER ABODE IN MANY TEMPLES AND WHO CAN SAY THAT A FAIR OUTSIDE SHELL NOT

FAIREST ARE TOO OFTEN ITS CHOSEN VICTIMS BUT CAN YOUOH CAN YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS DELICATE BOY HAS BEEN THE VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATE OF THE WORST OUTCASTS OF SOCIETY SAID ROSE THE SURGEON SHOOK HIS HEAD IN A MANNER WHICH INTIMATED THAT HE FEARED IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE AND OBSERVING THAT THEY MIGHT DISTURB THE PATIENT LED THE WAY INTO AN ADJOINING APARTMENT BUT EVEN IF HE HAS BEEN WICKED PURSUED ROSE THINK HOW YOUNG HE IS THINK THAT HE MAY NEVER HAVE KNOWN A MOTHERS LOVE OR THE COMFORT OF A HOME THAT ILLUSAGE AND BLOWS OR THE WANT OF BREAD MAY HAVE DRIVEN HIM TO HERD WITH MEN WHO HAVE FORCED HIM TO GUILT AUNT DEAR AUNT FOR MERCYS SAKE THINK OF THIS BEFORE YOU LET THEM DRAG THIS SICK CHILD TO A PRISON WHICH IN ANY CASE MUST BE THE GRAVE OF ALL HIS CHANCES OF AMENDMENT OH AS YOU LOVE ME AND

HOPE FOR THE SAKE OF THE RISING MALE SEX GENERALLY THAT YOU MAY BE FOUND IN AS VULNERABLE AND SOFTHEARTED A MOOD BY THE FIRST ELIGIBLE YOUNG FELLOW WHO APPEALS TO YOUR COMPASSION AND I WISH I WERE A

GOOD RETORTED THE DOCTOR THEN SO MUCH THE MORE REASON FOR ACCEDING TO MY PROPOSITION FINALLY THE TREATY WAS ENTERED INTO AND THE PARTIES THEREUNTO SAT DOWN TO WAIT WITH SOME IMPATIENCE UNTIL OLIVER SHOULD AWAKE THE PATIENCE OF THE TWO LADIES WAS DESTINED TO UNDERGO A LONGER TRIAL THAN MR LOSBERNE HAD LED THEM TO EXPECT FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR PASSED ON AND STILL OLIVER SLUMBERED HEAVILY IT WAS EVENING INDEED BEFORE THE KINDHEARTED DOCTOR BROUGHT THEM THE INTELLIGENCE THAT HE WAS AT LENGTH SUFFICIENTLY RESTORED TO BE SPOKEN TO THE BOY WAS VERY ILL HE SAID AND WEAK FROM THE LOSS OF BLOOD BUT HIS MIND WAS SO TROUBLED WITH ANXIETY TO DISCLOSE SOMETHING THAT HE DEEMED IT BETTER TO GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY THAN TO INSIST UPON HIS REMAINING QUIET UNTIL NEXT MORNING WHICH HE SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE THE CONFERENCE WAS A LONG ONE OLIVER TOLD THEM ALL HIS SIMPLE HISTORY AND WAS OFTEN COMPELLED TO STOP BY PAIN AND WANT OF STRENGTH IT WAS A SOLEMN THING TO HEAR IN THE DARKENED ROOM THE FEEBLE VOICE OF THE SICK CHILD RECOUNTING A WEARY CATALOGUE OF EVILS AND CALAMITIES WHICH HARD MEN HAD BROUGHT UPON HIM OH IF WHEN WE OPPRESS AND GRIND OUR FELLOWCREATURES WE BESTOWED BUT ONE THOUGHT ON THE DARK EVIDENCES OF HUMAN ERROR WHICH LIKE DENSE AND HEAVY CLOUDS ARE RISING SLOWLY IT IS TRUE BUT NOT LESS SURELY TO HEAVEN TO POUR THEIR AFTERVENGEANCE ON OUR HEADS IF WE HEARD BUT ONE INSTANT IN IMAGINATION THE DEEP TESTIMONY OF DEAD MENS VOICES WHICH NO POWER CAN STIFLE AND NO PRIDE SHUT OUT WHERE WOULD BE THE INJURY AND INJUSTICE THE SUFFERING MISERY CRUELTY AND WRONG THAT EACH DAYS LIFE

WHAT ACCOUNT DOES HE GIVE OF HIMSELF WHERE DID HE COME FROM HE DIDNT DROP OUT OF THE CLOUDS DID HE MASTER OF COURSE NOT REPLIED THE DOCTOR WITH A NERVOUS GLANCE AT THE TWO LADIES I KNOW HIS WHOLE HISTORY BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT PRESENTLY YOU WOULD LIKE FIRST TO SEE THE PLACE WHERE THE THIEVES MADE THEIR ATTEMPT I SUPPOSE CERTAINLY REJOINED MR BLATHERS WE HAD BETTER INSPECT THE PREMISES FIRST AND EXAMINE THE SERVANTS AFTERWARDS THATS THE USUAL WAY OF DOING BUSINESS LIGHTS WERE THEN PROCURED AND MESSRS BLATHERS AND DUFF ATTENDED BY THE NATIVE CONSTABLE BRITTLES GILES AND EVERYBODY ELSE IN SHORT WENT INTO THE LITTLE ROOM AT THE END OF THE PASSAGE AND LOOKED OUT AT THE WINDOW AND AFTERWARDS WENT ROUND BY WAY OF THE LAWN AND LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOW AND AFTER THAT HAD A CANDLE

OTHER IN NOT MORE THAN ONE IMPORTANT RESPECT THE FIRST TIME AND IN NOT MORE THAN A DOZEN THE LAST THIS CONSUMMATION BEING ARRIVED AT BLATHERS AND DUFF CLEARED THE ROOM AND HELD A LONG COUNCIL TOGETHER COMPARED WITH WHICH FOR SECRECY AND SOLEMNITY A CONSULTATION OF GREAT DOCTORS ON THE KNOTTIEST POINT IN MEDICINE WOULD BE MERE CHILDS PLAY MEANWHILE THE DOCTOR WALKED UP AND DOWN THE NEXT ROOM IN A VERY UNEASY STATE AND MRS MAYLIE AND ROSE LOOKED ON WITH ANXIOUS FACES UPON MY WORD HE SAID MAKING A HALT AFTER A GREAT NUMBER OF VERY RAPID TURNS I HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO DO SURELY SAID ROSE THE POOR CHILDS STORY FAITHFULLY REPEATED TO THESE MEN WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO EXONERATE HIM I DOUBT IT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY SAID THE DOCTOR SHAKING HIS HEAD I DONT THINK IT WOULD EXONERATE HIM EITHER WITH THEM OR WITH LEGAL FUNCTIONARIES OF A HIGHER GRADE WHAT IS HE AFTER ALL THEY WOULD SAY A RUNAWAY JUDGED BY MERE WORLDLY CONSIDERATIONS AND PROBABILITIES HIS STORY IS A VERY DOUBTFUL ONE YOU BELIEVE IT SURELY INTERRUPTED ROSE I BELIEVE IT STRANGE AS IT IS AND PERHAPS I MAY BE AN OLD FOOL FOR DOING SO REJOINED THE DOCTOR BUT I DONT THINK IT IS EXACTLY THE TALE FOR A PRACTICAL POLICEOFFICER NEVERTHELESS WHY NOT DEMANDED ROSE BECAUSE MY PRETTY CROSSEXAMINER REPLIED THE DOCTOR BECAUSE VIEWED WITH THEIR EYES THERE ARE MANY UGLY POINTS ABOUT IT HE CAN ONLY PROVE THE PARTS THAT LOOK ILL AND NONE OF THOSE THAT

CARRIED TO A POLICEOFFICER ON A CHARGE OF PICKING A GENTLEMANS POCKET HE HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FORCIBLY FROM THAT GENTLEMANS HOUSE TO A PLACE WHICH HE CANNOT DESCRIBE OR POINT OUT AND OF THE SITUATION OF WHICH HE HAS NOT THE REMOTEST IDEA HE IS BROUGHT DOWN TO CHERTSEY BY MEN WHO SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN A VIOLENT FANCY TO HIM WHETHER HE WILL OR NO AND IS PUT THROUGH A WINDOW TO ROB A HOUSE AND THEN JUST AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN HE IS GOING TO ALARM THE INMATES AND SO DO THE VERY THING THAT WOULD SET HIM ALL TO RIGHTS THERE RUSHES INTO THE WAY A BLUNDERING DOG OF A HALFBRED BUTLER AND SHOOTS HIM AS IF ON PURPOSE TO PREVENT HIS DOING ANY GOOD FOR HIMSELF DONT YOU SEE ALL THIS I SEE IT OF COURSE REPLIED ROSE SMILING AT THE DOCTORS IMPETUOSITY BUT STILL I DO NOT SEE ANYTHING IN IT TO CRIMINATE THE POOR CHILD NO REPLIED THE DOCTOR OF COURSE NOT BLESS THE BRIGHT EYES OF YOUR SEX THEY NEVER SEE WHETHER FOR GOOD OR BAD MORE THAN ONE SIDE OF ANY QUESTION AND THAT IS ALWAYS THE ONE WHICH FIRST PRESENTS ITSELF TO THEM HAVING GIVEN VENT TO THIS RESULT OF EXPERIENCE THE DOCTOR PUT HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WITH EVEN GREATER RAPIDITY THAN BEFORE THE MORE I THINK OF IT SAID THE DOCTOR THE MORE I SEE THAT IT WILL OCCASION ENDLESS TROUBLE AND DIFFICULTY IF WE PUT THESE MEN IN POSSESSION OF THE BOYS REAL STORY I AM CERTAIN IT WILL NOT BE BELIEVED AND EVEN IF THEY CAN DO NOTHING TO HIM IN THE END STILL THE DRAGGING IT FORWARD AND GIVING PUBLICITY TO ALL THE DOUBTS THAT WILL BE CAST UPON IT MUST INTERFERE MATERIALLY WITH YOUR BENEVOLENT PLAN OF RESCUING HIM FROM MISERY OH WHAT IS TO BE DONE CRIED ROSE DEAR DEAR WHY DID THEY SEND FOR THESE PEOPLE WHY INDEED EXCLAIMED MRS MAYLIE I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THEM HERE FOR THE WORLD ALL I KNOW IS SAID MR LOSBERNE AT LAST

UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS GOING FORWARDIN FACT WITHOUT SEEMING TO RECOLLECT WHERE HE WAS OR WHAT HAD BEEN PASSING THIS SAID MR LOSBERNE SPEAKING SOFTLY BUT WITH GREAT VEHEMENCE NOTWITHSTANDING THIS IS THE LAD WHO BEING ACCIDENTLY WOUNDED BY A SPRINGGUN IN SOME BOYISH TRESPASS ON MR WHATD YECALLHIMS GROUNDS AT THE BACK HERE COMES TO THE HOUSE FOR ASSISTANCE THIS MORNING AND IS IMMEDIATELY LAID HOLD

HE WAS THUS RECOMMENDED TO THEIR NOTICE THE BEWILDERED BUTLER GAZED FROM THEM TOWARDS OLIVER AND FROM OLIVER TOWARDS MR LOSBERNE WITH A MOST LUDICROUS MIXTURE OF FEAR AND PERPLEXITY YOU DONT MEAN TO

DURING THIS SHORT DIALOGUE BUT HE NOW ROSE FROM THE CHAIR BY THE BEDSIDE AND REMARKED THAT IF THE OFFICERS HAD ANY DOUBTS UPON THE SUBJECT THEY WOULD PERHAPS LIKE TO STEP INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND HAVE BRITTLES BEFORE THEM ACTING UPON THIS SUGGESTION THEY ADJOURNED TO A NEIGHBOURING APARTMENT WHERE MR BRITTLES BEING CALLED IN INVOLVED HIMSELF AND HIS RESPECTED SUPERIOR IN SUCH A WONDERFUL MAZE OF FRESH CONTRADICTIONS AND IMPOSSIBILITIES AS TENDED TO THROW NO PARTICULAR LIGHT ON ANYTHING BUT THE FACT OF HIS OWN STRONG MYSTIFICATION EXCEPT INDEED HIS DECLARATIONS THAT HE SHOULDNT KNOW THE REAL BOY IF HE WERE PUT BEFORE HIM THAT INSTANT THAT HE HAD ONLY TAKEN OLIVER TO BE HE BECAUSE MR GILES HAD SAID HE WAS AND THAT MR GILES HAD FIVE MINUTES PREVIOUSLY ADMITTED IN THE KITCHEN THAT HE BEGAN TO BE VERY MUCH AFRAID HE HAD BEEN A LITTLE TOO HASTY AMONG OTHER INGENIOUS SURMISES THE QUESTION WAS THEN RAISED WHETHER MR GILES HAD REALLY HIT ANYBODY AND UPON EXAMINATION OF THE FELLOW PISTOL TO THAT WHICH HE HAD FIRED IT TURNED OUT TO HAVE NO MORE DESTRUCTIVE LOADING THAN GUNPOWDER AND BROWN PAPER A DISCOVERY WHICH MADE A CONSIDERABLE IMPRESSION ON EVERYBODY BUT THE DOCTOR WHO HAD DRAWN THE BALL ABOUT TEN MINUTES BEFORE UPON NO ONE HOWEVER DID IT MAKE A GREATER IMPRESSION THAN ON MR GILES HIMSELF WHO AFTER LABOURING FOR SOME HOURS UNDER THE FEAR OF HAVING MORTALLY WOUNDED A FELLOWCREATURE EAGERLY CAUGHT AT THIS NEW IDEA AND FAVOURED IT TO THE UTMOST FINALLY THE OFFICERS WITHOUT TROUBLING THEMSELVES VERY MUCH ABOUT OLIVER LEFT THE CHERTSEY CONSTABLE IN THE HOUSE AND TOOK UP THEIR REST FOR THAT NIGHT IN THE TOWN PROMISING TO RETURN THE NEXT MORNING WITH THE NEXT MORNING THERE CAME A RUMOUR THAT TWO MEN AND A BOY WERE IN THE CAGE AT KINGSTON WHO HAD BEEN APPREHENDED OVER NIGHT UNDER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES AND TO KINGSTON MESSRS BLATHERS AND DUFF JOURNEYED ACCORDINGLY THE SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES HOWEVER RESOLVING THEMSELVES ON INVESTIGATION INTO THE ONE FACT THAT THEY HAD BEEN DISCOVERED SLEEPING UNDER A HAYSTACK WHICH ALTHOUGH A GREAT CRIME IS ONLY PUNISHABLE BY IMPRISONMENT AND IS IN THE MERCIFUL EYE OF THE ENGLISH LAW AND ITS COMPREHENSIVE LOVE OF ALL THE KINGS SUBJECTS HELD TO BE NO SATISFACTORY PROOF IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL OTHER EVIDENCE THAT THE SLEEPER OR SLEEPERS HAVE COMMITTED BURGLARY ACCOMPANIED WITH VIOLENCE AND HAVE THEREFORE RENDERED THEMSELVES LIABLE TO THE PUNISHMENT OF DEATH MESSRS BLATHERS AND DUFF CAME BACK AGAIN AS WISE AS THEY WENT IN SHORT AFTER SOME MORE EXAMINATION AND A GREAT DEAL MORE CONVERSATION A NEIGHBOURING MAGISTRATE WAS READILY INDUCED TO TAKE THE JOINT BAIL OF MRS MAYLIE AND MR LOSBERNE FOR OLIVERS APPEARANCE IF HE SHOULD EVER BE CALLED UPON AND BLATHERS AND DUFF BEING REWARDED WITH A COUPLE OF GUINEAS RETURNED TO TOWN WITH DIVIDED OPINIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF THEIR EXPEDITION THE LATTER GENTLEMAN ON A MATURE CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES INCLINING TO THE BELIEF THAT THE BURGLARIOUS ATTEMPT HAD ORIGINATED WITH THE FAMILY PET AND THE FORMER BEING EQUALLY DISPOSED TO CONCEDE THE FULL MERIT OF IT TO THE GREAT MR CONKEY CHICKWEED MEANWHILE OLIVER GRADUALLY THROVE AND PROSPERED UNDER THE UNITED CARE OF MRS MAYLIE ROSE AND THE KINDHEARTED MR LOSBERNE IF FERVENT PRAYERS GUSHING FROM HEARTS OVERCHARGED WITH GRATITUDE BE HEARD IN HEAVENAND IF THEY BE NOT WHAT PRAYERS ARETHE BLESSINGS WHICH THE ORPHAN CHILD CALLED DOWN UPON THEM SUNK INTO THEIR SOULS DIFFUSING PEACE AND HAPPINESS CHAPTER XXXII OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS OLIVERS AILINGS WERE NEITHER SLIGHT NOR FEW IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN AND DELAY ATTENDANT ON A BROKEN LIMB HIS EXPOSURE TO THE WET AND COLD HAD BROUGHT ON FEVER AND AGUE WHICH HUNG ABOUT HIM FOR MANY WEEKS AND REDUCED HIM SADLY BUT AT LENGTH HE BEGAN BY SLOW DEGREES TO GET BETTER AND TO BE ABLE TO SAY SOMETIMES IN A FEW TEARFUL WORDS HOW DEEPLY HE FELT THE GOODNESS OF THE TWO SWEET LADIES AND HOW ARDENTLY HE HOPED THAT WHEN HE GREW STRONG AND WELL AGAIN HE COULD DO SOMETHING TO SHOW HIS GRATITUDE ONLY SOMETHING WHICH WOULD LET THEM SEE THE LOVE AND DUTY WITH WHICH HIS BREAST WAS FULL SOMETHING HOWEVER SLIGHT WHICH WOULD PROVE TO THEM THAT THEIR GENTLE KINDNESS HAD NOT BEEN CAST AWAY BUT THAT THE POOR BOY WHOM THEIR CHARITY HAD RESCUED FROM MISERY OR DEATH WAS EAGER TO SERVE THEM WITH HIS WHOLE HEART AND SOUL POOR FELLOW SAID ROSE WHEN OLIVER HAD BEEN ONE DAY FEEBLY ENDEAVOURING TO UTTER THE WORDS OF THANKFULNESS THAT ROSE TO HIS PALE LIPS YOU SHALL HAVE MANY OPPORTUNITIES OF SERVING US IF YOU WILL WE ARE GOING

THE YOUNG LADY TO THINK THAT MY DEAR GOOD AUNT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE MEANS OF RESCUING ANY ONE FROM SUCH SAD MISERY AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED TO US WOULD BE AN UNSPEAKABLE PLEASURE TO ME BUT TO KNOW THAT THE OBJECT OF HER GOODNESS AND COMPASSION WAS SINCERELY GRATEFUL AND ATTACHED IN CONSEQUENCE WOULD DELIGHT ME MORE THAN YOU CAN WELL IMAGINE DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME SHE INQUIRED WATCHING OLIVERS THOUGHTFUL FACE OH YES MAAM YES REPLIED OLIVER EAGERLY BUT I WAS THINKING THAT I AM UNGRATEFUL NOW TO WHOM INQUIRED THE YOUNG LADY TO THE KIND GENTLEMAN AND THE DEAR OLD NURSE WHO TOOK SO MUCH CARE OF ME BEFORE REJOINED OLIVER IF THEY KNEW HOW HAPPY I AM THEY WOULD BE PLEASED I AM SURE I AM SURE THEY WOULD REJOINED OLIVERS BENEFACTRESS AND MR LOSBERNE HAS ALREADY BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO PROMISE THAT WHEN YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH TO BEAR THE JOURNEY HE WILL CARRY YOU TO SEE THEM HAS HE MAAM CRIED OLIVER HIS FACE BRIGHTENING WITH PLEASURE I DONT KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO FOR JOY WHEN I SEE THEIR KIND FACES ONCE AGAIN IN A SHORT TIME OLIVER WAS SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED TO UNDERGO THE FATIGUE OF THIS EXPEDITION ONE MORNING HE AND MR LOSBERNE SET OUT ACCORDINGLY IN A LITTLE CARRIAGE WHICH BELONGED TO MRS MAYLIE WHEN THEY CAME TO CHERTSEY BRIDGE OLIVER TURNED VERY PALE AND UTTERED A LOUD EXCLAMATION WHATS THE MATTER WITH THE BOY CRIED THE DOCTOR AS USUAL ALL IN A BUSTLE DO YOU SEE ANYTHINGHEAR ANYTHINGFEEL ANYTHINGEH THAT SIR CRIED OLIVER POINTING OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOW THAT HOUSE YES WELL WHAT OF IT STOP COACHMAN PULL UP HERE CRIED THE DOCTOR WHAT OF THE HOUSE MY MAN EH THE THIEVESTHE HOUSE THEY TOOK ME TO WHISPERED OLIVER THE DEVIL IT IS CRIED THE DOCTOR HALLO THERE LET ME OUT BUT BEFORE THE COACHMAN COULD DISMOUNT FROM HIS BOX HE HAD TUMBLED OUT OF THE COACH BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER AND RUNNING DOWN TO THE DESERTED TENEMENT BEGAN KICKING AT THE DOOR LIKE A MADMAN HALLOA SAID A LITTLE UGLY HUMPBACKED MAN OPENING THE DOOR SO SUDDENLY THAT THE DOCTOR FROM THE VERY IMPETUS OF HIS LAST KICK NEARLY FELL FORWARD INTO THE PASSAGE WHATS THE MATTER HERE MATTER EXCLAIMED THE OTHER COLLARING HIM WITHOUT A MOMENTS REFLECTION A GOOD DEAL ROBBERY IS THE MATTER THERELL BE MURDER THE MATTER TOO REPLIED THE HUMPBACKED MAN COOLLY IF YOU DONT TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF DO YOU HEAR ME I HEAR YOU SAID THE DOCTOR GIVING HIS CAPTIVE A HEARTY SHAKE WHERESCONFOUND THE FELLOW WHATS HIS RASCALLY NAMESIKES THATS IT WHERES SIKES YOU THIEF THE HUMPBACKED MAN STARED AS IF IN EXCESS OF AMAZEMENT AND INDIGNATION THEN TWISTING HIMSELF DEXTEROUSLY FROM THE DOCTORS GRASP GROWLED FORTH A VOLLEY OF HORRID OATHS AND RETIRED INTO THE HOUSE BEFORE HE COULD SHUT THE DOOR HOWEVER THE DOCTOR HAD PASSED INTO THE PARLOUR WITHOUT A WORD OF PARLEY HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ROUND NOT AN ARTICLE OF FURNITURE NOT A VESTIGE OF ANYTHING ANIMATE OR INANIMATE NOT EVEN THE POSITION OF THE CUPBOARDS ANSWERED OLIVERS DESCRIPTION NOW SAID THE HUMPBACKED MAN WHO HAD WATCHED HIM KEENLY WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COMING INTO MY HOUSE IN THIS VIOLENT WAY DO YOU WANT TO ROB ME OR TO MURDER ME WHICH IS IT DID YOU EVER KNOW A MAN COME OUT TO DO EITHER IN A CHARIOT AND PAIR YOU RIDICULOUS OLD VAMPIRE SAID THE IRRITABLE DOCTOR WHAT DO YOU WANT THEN DEMANDED THE HUNCHBACK WILL YOU TAKE YOURSELF OFF BEFORE I DO YOU A MISCHIEF CURSE YOU AS SOON AS I THINK PROPER SAID MR LOSBERNE LOOKING INTO THE OTHER PARLOUR WHICH LIKE THE FIRST BORE NO RESEMBLANCE WHATEVER TO OLIVERS ACCOUNT OF IT I SHALL FIND YOU OUT SOME DAY MY FRIEND WILL YOU SNEERED THE ILLFAVOURED CRIPPLE IF YOU EVER WANT ME IM HERE I HAVENT LIVED HERE MAD AND ALL ALONE FOR FIVEANDTWENTY YEARS TO BE SCARED BY YOU YOU SHALL PAY FOR THIS YOU SHALL PAY FOR THIS AND SO SAYING THE MISSHAPEN LITTLE DEMON SET UP A YELL AND DANCED UPON THE GROUND AS IF WILD WITH RAGE STUPID ENOUGH THIS MUTTERED THE DOCTOR TO HIMSELF THE BOY MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE HERE PUT THAT IN YOUR POCKET AND SHUT YOURSELF UP AGAIN WITH THESE WORDS HE FLUNG THE HUNCHBACK A PIECE OF MONEY AND RETURNED TO THE CARRIAGE THE MAN FOLLOWED TO THE CHARIOT DOOR UTTERING THE WILDEST IMPRECATIONS AND CURSES ALL THE WAY BUT AS MR LOSBERNE TURNED TO SPEAK TO THE DRIVER HE LOOKED INTO THE CARRIAGE AND EYED OLIVER FOR AN INSTANT WITH A GLANCE SO SHARP AND FIERCE AND AT THE SAME TIME SO FURIOUS AND VINDICTIVE THAT WAKING OR SLEEPING HE COULD NOT FORGET IT FOR MONTHS AFTERWARDS HE CONTINUED TO UTTER THE MOST FEARFUL IMPRECATIONS UNTIL THE DRIVER HAD RESUMED HIS SEAT AND WHEN THEY WERE ONCE MORE ON THEIR WAY THEY COULD SEE HIM SOME DISTANCE BEHIND BEATING HIS FEET UPON THE GROUND AND TEARING HIS HAIR IN TRANSPORTS OF REAL OR PRETENDED RAGE I AM AN ASS SAID THE DOCTOR AFTER A LONG SILENCE DID YOU KNOW THAT BEFORE OLIVER NO SIR THEN DONT FORGET IT ANOTHER TIME AN ASS SAID THE DOCTOR AGAIN AFTER A FURTHER SILENCE OF SOME MINUTES EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN THE RIGHT PLACE AND THE RIGHT FELLOWS HAD BEEN THERE WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE SINGLEHANDED AND IF I HAD HAD ASSISTANCE I SEE NO GOOD THAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE EXCEPT LEADING TO MY OWN EXPOSURE AND AN UNAVOIDABLE STATEMENT OF THE MANNER IN WHICH I HAVE HUSHED UP THIS BUSINESS THAT WOULD HAVE SERVED ME RIGHT THOUGH I AM ALWAYS INVOLVING MYSELF IN SOME SCRAPE OR OTHER BY ACTING ON IMPULSE IT MIGHT HAVE DONE ME GOOD NOW THE FACT WAS THAT THE EXCELLENT DOCTOR HAD NEVER ACTED UPON ANYTHING BUT IMPULSE ALL THROUGH HIS LIFE AND IT WAS NO BAD COMPLIMENT TO THE NATURE OF THE IMPULSES WHICH GOVERNED HIM THAT SO FAR FROM BEING INVOLVED IN ANY PECULIAR TROUBLES OR MISFORTUNES HE HAD THE WARMEST RESPECT AND ESTEEM OF ALL WHO KNEW HIM IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD HE WAS A LITTLE OUT OF TEMPER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO AT BEING DISAPPOINTED IN PROCURING CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE OF OLIVERS STORY ON THE VERY FIRST OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAD A CHANCE OF OBTAINING ANY HE SOON CAME ROUND AGAIN HOWEVER AND FINDING THAT OLIVERS REPLIES TO HIS QUESTIONS WERE STILL AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND CONSISTENT AND STILL DELIVERED WITH AS MUCH APPARENT SINCERITY AND TRUTH AS THEY HAD EVER BEEN HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO ATTACH FULL CREDENCE TO THEM FROM THAT TIME FORTH AS OLIVER KNEW THE NAME OF THE STREET IN WHICH MR BROWNLOW RESIDED THEY WERE ENABLED TO DRIVE STRAIGHT THITHER WHEN THE COACH TURNED INTO IT HIS HEART BEAT SO VIOLENTLY THAT HE COULD SCARCELY DRAW HIS BREATH NOW MY BOY WHICH HOUSE IS IT INQUIRED MR LOSBERNE THAT THAT REPLIED OLIVER POINTING EAGERLY OUT OF THE WINDOW THE WHITE HOUSE OH MAKE HASTE PRAY MAKE HASTE I FEEL AS IF I SHOULD DIE IT MAKES ME TREMBLE SO COME COME SAID THE GOOD DOCTOR PATTING HIM ON THE SHOULDER YOU WILL SEE THEM DIRECTLY AND THEY WILL BE OVERJOYED TO FIND YOU SAFE AND WELL OH I HOPE SO CRIED OLIVER THEY WERE SO GOOD TO ME SO VERY VERY GOOD TO ME THE COACH ROLLED ON IT STOPPED NO THAT WAS THE WRONG HOUSE THE NEXT DOOR IT WENT ON A FEW PACES AND STOPPED AGAIN OLIVER LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS WITH TEARS OF HAPPY EXPECTATION COURSING DOWN HIS FACE ALAS THE WHITE HOUSE WAS EMPTY AND THERE WAS A BILL IN THE WINDOW TO LET KNOCK AT THE NEXT DOOR CRIED MR LOSBERNE TAKING OLIVERS ARM IN HIS WHAT HAS BECOME OF MR BROWNLOW WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE ADJOINING HOUSE DO YOU KNOW THE SERVANT DID NOT KNOW BUT WOULD GO AND INQUIRE SHE PRESENTLY RETURNED AND SAID THAT MR BROWNLOW HAD SOLD OFF HIS GOODS AND GONE TO THE WEST INDIES SIX WEEKS BEFORE OLIVER CLASPED HIS HANDS AND SANK FEEBLY BACKWARD HAS HIS HOUSEKEEPER GONE TOO INQUIRED MR LOSBERNE AFTER A MOMENTS PAUSE YES SIR REPLIED THE SERVANT THE OLD GENTLEMAN THE HOUSEKEEPER AND A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS A FRIEND OF MR BROWNLOWS ALL WENT TOGETHER THEN TURN TOWARDS HOME AGAIN SAID MR LOSBERNE TO THE DRIVER AND DONT STOP TO BAIT THE HORSES TILL YOU GET OUT OF THIS CONFOUNDED LONDON THE BOOKSTALL KEEPER SIR SAID OLIVER I KNOW THE WAY THERE SEE HIM PRAY SIR DO SEE HIM MY POOR BOY THIS IS DISAPPOINTMENT ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY SAID THE DOCTOR QUITE ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US IF WE GO TO THE BOOKSTALL KEEPERS WE SHALL CERTAINLY FIND THAT HE IS DEAD OR HAS SET HIS HOUSE ON FIRE OR RUN AWAY NO HOME AGAIN STRAIGHT AND IN OBEDIENCE TO THE DOCTORS IMPULSE HOME THEY WENT THIS BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT CAUSED OLIVER MUCH SORROW AND GRIEF EVEN IN THE MIDST OF HIS HAPPINESS FOR HE HAD PLEASED HIMSELF MANY TIMES DURING HIS ILLNESS WITH THINKING OF ALL THAT MR BROWNLOW AND MRS BEDWIN WOULD SAY TO HIM AND WHAT DELIGHT IT WOULD BE TO TELL THEM HOW MANY LONG DAYS AND NIGHTS HE HAD PASSED IN REFLECTING ON WHAT THEY HAD DONE FOR HIM AND IN BEWAILING HIS CRUEL SEPARATION FROM THEM THE HOPE OF EVENTUALLY CLEARING HIMSELF WITH THEM TOO AND EXPLAINING HOW HE HAD BEEN FORCED AWAY HAD BUOYED HIM UP AND SUSTAINED HIM UNDER MANY OF HIS RECENT TRIALS AND NOW THE IDEA THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE SO FAR AND CARRIED WITH THEM THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS AN IMPOSTOR AND A ROBBERA BELIEF WHICH MIGHT REMAIN UNCONTRADICTED TO HIS DYING DAYWAS ALMOST MORE THAN HE COULD BEAR THE CIRCUMSTANCE OCCASIONED NO ALTERATION HOWEVER IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF HIS BENEFACTORS AFTER ANOTHER FORTNIGHT WHEN THE FINE WARM WEATHER HAD FAIRLY BEGUN AND EVERY TREE AND FLOWER WAS PUTTING FORTH ITS YOUNG LEAVES AND RICH BLOSSOMS THEY MADE PREPARATIONS FOR QUITTING THE HOUSE AT CHERTSEY FOR SOME MONTHS SENDING THE PLATE WHICH HAD SO EXCITED FAGINS CUPIDITY TO THE BANKERS AND LEAVING GILES AND ANOTHER SERVANT IN CARE OF THE HOUSE THEY DEPARTED TO A COTTAGE AT SOME DISTANCE IN THE COUNTRY AND TOOK OLIVER WITH THEM WHO CAN DESCRIBE THE PLEASURE AND DELIGHT THE PEACE OF MIND AND SOFT TRANQUILLITY THE SICKLY BOY FELT IN THE BALMY AIR AND AMONG THE GREEN HILLS AND RICH WOODS OF AN INLAND VILLAGE WHO CAN TELL HOW SCENES OF PEACE AND QUIETUDE SINK INTO THE MINDS OF PAINWORN DWELLERS IN CLOSE AND NOISY PLACES AND CARRY THEIR OWN FRESHNESS DEEP INTO THEIR JADED HEARTS MEN WHO HAVE LIVED IN CROWDED PENTUP STREETS THROUGH LIVES OF TOIL AND WHO HAVE NEVER WISHED FOR CHANGE MEN TO WHOM CUSTOM HAS INDEED BEEN SECOND NATURE AND WHO HAVE COME ALMOST TO LOVE EACH BRICK AND STONE THAT FORMED THE NARROW BOUNDARIES OF THEIR DAILY WALKS EVEN THEY WITH THE HAND OF DEATH UPON THEM HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO YEARN AT LAST FOR ONE SHORT GLIMPSE OF NATURES FACE AND CARRIED FAR FROM THE SCENES OF THEIR OLD PAINS AND PLEASURES HAVE SEEMED TO PASS AT ONCE INTO A NEW STATE OF BEING CRAWLING FORTH FROM DAY TO DAY TO SOME GREEN SUNNY SPOT THEY HAVE HAD SUCH MEMORIES WAKENED UP WITHIN THEM BY THE SIGHT OF THE SKY AND HILL AND PLAIN AND GLISTENING WATER THAT A FORETASTE OF HEAVEN ITSELF HAS SOOTHED THEIR QUICK DECLINE AND THEY HAVE SUNK INTO THEIR TOMBS AS PEACEFULLY AS THE SUN WHOSE SETTING THEY WATCHED FROM THEIR LONELY CHAMBER WINDOW BUT A FEW HOURS BEFORE FADED FROM THEIR DIM AND FEEBLE SIGHT THE MEMORIES WHICH PEACEFUL COUNTRY SCENES CALL UP ARE NOT OF THIS WORLD NOR OF ITS THOUGHTS AND HOPES THEIR GENTLE INFLUENCE MAY TEACH US HOW TO WEAVE FRESH GARLANDS FOR THE GRAVES OF THOSE WE LOVED MAY PURIFY OUR THOUGHTS AND BEAR DOWN BEFORE IT OLD ENMITY AND HATRED BUT BENEATH ALL THIS THERE LINGERS IN THE LEAST REFLECTIVE MIND A VAGUE AND HALFFORMED CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING HELD SUCH FEELINGS LONG BEFORE IN SOME REMOTE AND DISTANT TIME WHICH CALLS UP SOLEMN THOUGHTS OF DISTANT TIMES TO COME AND BENDS DOWN PRIDE AND WORLDLINESS BENEATH IT IT WAS A LOVELY SPOT TO WHICH THEY REPAIRED OLIVER WHOSE DAYS HAD BEEN SPENT AMONG SQUALID CROWDS AND IN THE MIDST OF NOISE AND BRAWLING SEEMED TO ENTER ON A NEW EXISTENCE THERE THE ROSE AND HONEYSUCKLE CLUNG TO THE COTTAGE WALLS THE IVY CREPT ROUND THE TRUNKS OF THE TREES AND THE GARDENFLOWERS PERFUMED THE AIR WITH DELICIOUS ODOURS HARD BY WAS A LITTLE CHURCHYARD NOT CROWDED WITH TALL UNSIGHTLY GRAVESTONES BUT FULL OF HUMBLE MOUNDS COVERED WITH FRESH TURF AND MOSS BENEATH WHICH THE OLD PEOPLE OF THE VILLAGE LAY AT REST OLIVER OFTEN WANDERED HERE AND THINKING OF THE WRETCHED GRAVE IN WHICH HIS MOTHER LAY WOULD SOMETIMES SIT HIM DOWN AND SOB UNSEEN BUT WHEN HE RAISED HIS EYES TO THE DEEP SKY OVERHEAD HE WOULD CEASE TO THINK OF HER AS LYING IN THE GROUND AND WOULD WEEP FOR HER SADLY BUT WITHOUT PAIN IT WAS A HAPPY TIME THE DAYS WERE PEACEFUL AND SERENE THE NIGHTS BROUGHT WITH THEM NEITHER FEAR NOR CARE NO LANGUISHING IN A WRETCHED PRISON OR ASSOCIATING WITH WRETCHED MEN NOTHING BUT PLEASANT AND HAPPY THOUGHTS EVERY MORNING HE WENT TO A WHITEHEADED OLD GENTLEMAN WHO LIVED NEAR THE LITTLE CHURCH WHO TAUGHT HIM TO READ BETTER AND TO WRITE AND WHO SPOKE SO KINDLY AND TOOK SUCH PAINS THAT OLIVER COULD NEVER TRY ENOUGH TO PLEASE HIM THEN HE WOULD WALK WITH MRS MAYLIE AND ROSE AND HEAR THEM TALK OF BOOKS OR PERHAPS SIT NEAR THEM IN SOME SHADY PLACE AND LISTEN WHILST THE YOUNG LADY READ WHICH HE COULD HAVE DONE UNTIL IT GREW TOO DARK TO SEE THE LETTERS THEN HE HAD HIS OWN LESSON FOR THE NEXT DAY TO PREPARE AND AT THIS HE WOULD WORK HARD IN A LITTLE ROOM WHICH LOOKED INTO THE GARDEN TILL EVENING CAME SLOWLY ON WHEN THE LADIES WOULD WALK OUT AGAIN AND HE WITH THEM LISTENING WITH SUCH PLEASURE TO ALL THEY SAID AND SO HAPPY IF THEY WANTED A FLOWER THAT HE COULD CLIMB TO REACH OR HAD FORGOTTEN ANYTHING HE COULD RUN TO FETCH THAT HE COULD NEVER BE QUICK ENOUGH ABOUT IT WHEN IT BECAME QUITE DARK AND THEY RETURNED HOME THE YOUNG LADY WOULD SIT DOWN TO THE PIANO AND PLAY SOME PLEASANT AIR OR SING IN A LOW AND GENTLE VOICE SOME OLD SONG WHICH IT PLEASED HER AUNT TO HEAR THERE WOULD BE NO CANDLES LIGHTED AT SUCH TIMES AS THESE AND OLIVER WOULD SIT BY ONE OF THE WINDOWS LISTENING TO THE SWEET MUSIC IN A PERFECT RAPTURE AND WHEN SUNDAY CAME HOW DIFFERENTLY THE DAY WAS SPENT FROM ANY WAY IN WHICH HE HAD EVER SPENT IT YET AND HOW HAPPILY TOO LIKE ALL THE OTHER DAYS IN THAT MOST HAPPY TIME THERE WAS THE LITTLE CHURCH IN THE MORNING WITH THE GREEN LEAVES FLUTTERING AT THE WINDOWS THE BIRDS SINGING WITHOUT AND THE SWEETSMELLING AIR STEALING IN AT THE LOW PORCH AND FILLING THE HOMELY BUILDING WITH ITS FRAGRANCE THE POOR PEOPLE WERE SO NEAT AND CLEAN AND KNELT SO REVERENTLY IN PRAYER THAT IT SEEMED A PLEASURE NOT A TEDIOUS DUTY THEIR ASSEMBLING THERE TOGETHER AND THOUGH THE SINGING MIGHT BE RUDE IT WAS REAL AND SOUNDED MORE MUSICAL TO OLIVERS EARS AT LEAST THAN ANY HE HAD EVER HEARD IN CHURCH BEFORE THEN THERE WERE THE WALKS AS USUAL AND MANY CALLS AT THE CLEAN HOUSES OF THE LABOURING MEN AND AT NIGHT OLIVER READ A CHAPTER OR TWO FROM THE BIBLE WHICH HE HAD BEEN STUDYING ALL THE WEEK AND IN THE PERFORMANCE OF WHICH DUTY HE FELT MORE PROUD AND PLEASED THAN IF HE HAD BEEN THE CLERGYMAN HIMSELF IN THE MORNING OLIVER WOULD BE AFOOT BY SIX OCLOCK ROAMING THE FIELDS AND PLUNDERING THE HEDGES FAR AND WIDE FOR NOSEGAYS OF WILD FLOWERS WITH WHICH HE WOULD RETURN LADEN HOME AND WHICH IT TOOK GREAT CARE AND CONSIDERATION TO ARRANGE TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE FOR THE EMBELLISHMENT OF THE BREAKFASTTABLE THERE WAS FRESH GROUNDSEL TOO FOR MISS MAYLIES BIRDS WITH WHICH OLIVER WHO HAD BEEN STUDYING THE SUBJECT UNDER THE ABLE TUITION OF THE VILLAGE CLERK WOULD DECORATE THE CAGES IN THE MOST APPROVED TASTE WHEN THE BIRDS WERE MADE ALL SPRUCE AND SMART FOR THE DAY THERE WAS USUALLY SOME LITTLE COMMISSION OF CHARITY TO EXECUTE IN THE VILLAGE OR FAILING THAT THERE WAS RARE CRICKETPLAYING SOMETIMES ON THE GREEN OR FAILING THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO DO IN THE GARDEN OR ABOUT THE PLANTS TO WHICH OLIVER WHO HAD STUDIED THIS SCIENCE ALSO UNDER THE SAME MASTER WHO WAS A GARDENER BY TRADE APPLIED HIMSELF WITH HEARTY GOODWILL UNTIL MISS ROSE MADE HER APPEARANCE WHEN THERE WERE A THOUSAND COMMENDATIONS TO BE BESTOWED ON ALL HE HAD DONE SO THREE MONTHS GLIDED AWAY THREE MONTHS WHICH IN THE LIFE OF THE MOST BLESSED AND FAVOURED OF MORTALS MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNMINGLED HAPPINESS AND WHICH IN OLIVERS WERE TRUE FELICITY WITH THE PUREST AND MOST AMIABLE GENEROSITY ON ONE SIDE AND THE TRUEST WARMEST SOULFELT GRATITUDE ON THE OTHER IT IS NO WONDER THAT BY THE END OF THAT SHORT TIME OLIVER TWIST HAD BECOME COMPLETELY DOMESTICATED WITH THE OLD LADY AND HER NIECE AND THAT THE FERVENT ATTACHMENT OF HIS YOUNG AND SENSITIVE HEART WAS REPAID BY THEIR PRIDE IN AND ATTACHMENT TO HIMSELF CHAPTER XXXIII WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK SPRING FLEW SWIFTLY BY AND SUMMER CAME IF THE VILLAGE HAD BEEN BEAUTIFUL AT FIRST IT WAS NOW IN THE FULL GLOW AND LUXURIANCE OF ITS RICHNESS THE GREAT TREES WHICH HAD LOOKED SHRUNKEN AND BARE IN THE EARLIER MONTHS HAD NOW BURST INTO STRONG LIFE AND HEALTH AND STRETCHING FORTH THEIR GREEN ARMS OVER THE THIRSTY GROUND CONVERTED OPEN AND NAKED SPOTS INTO CHOICE NOOKS WHERE WAS A DEEP AND PLEASANT SHADE FROM WHICH TO LOOK UPON THE WIDE PROSPECT STEEPED IN SUNSHINE WHICH LAY STRETCHED BEYOND THE EARTH HAD DONNED HER MANTLE OF BRIGHTEST GREEN AND SHED HER RICHEST PERFUMES ABROAD IT WAS THE PRIME AND VIGOUR OF THE YEAR ALL THINGS WERE GLAD AND FLOURISHING STILL THE SAME QUIET LIFE WENT ON AT THE LITTLE COTTAGE AND THE SAME CHEERFUL SERENITY PREVAILED AMONG ITS INMATES OLIVER HAD LONG SINCE GROWN STOUT AND HEALTHY BUT HEALTH OR SICKNESS MADE NO DIFFERENCE IN HIS WARM FEELINGS OF A GREAT MANY PEOPLE HE WAS STILL THE SAME GENTLE ATTACHED AFFECTIONATE CREATURE THAT HE HAD BEEN WHEN PAIN AND SUFFERING HAD WASTED HIS STRENGTH AND WHEN HE WAS DEPENDENT FOR EVERY SLIGHT ATTENTION AND COMFORT ON THOSE WHO TENDED HIM ONE BEAUTIFUL NIGHT WHEN THEY HAD TAKEN A LONGER WALK THAN WAS CUSTOMARY WITH THEM FOR THE DAY HAD BEEN UNUSUALLY WARM AND THERE WAS A BRILLIANT MOON AND A LIGHT WIND HAD SPRUNG UP WHICH WAS UNUSUALLY REFRESHING ROSE HAD BEEN IN HIGH SPIRITS TOO AND THEY HAD WALKED ON IN MERRY CONVERSATION UNTIL THEY HAD FAR EXCEEDED THEIR ORDINARY BOUNDS MRS MAYLIE BEING FATIGUED THEY RETURNED MORE SLOWLY HOME THE YOUNG LADY MERELY THROWING OFF HER SIMPLE BONNET SAT DOWN TO THE PIANO AS USUAL AFTER RUNNING ABSTRACTEDLY OVER THE KEYS FOR A FEW MINUTES SHE FELL INTO A LOW AND VERY SOLEMN AIR AND AS SHE PLAYED IT THEY HEARD A SOUND AS IF SHE WERE WEEPING ROSE MY DEAR SAID THE ELDER LADY ROSE MADE NO REPLY BUT PLAYED A LITTLE QUICKER AS THOUGH THE WORDS HAD ROUSED HER FROM SOME PAINFUL THOUGHTS ROSE MY LOVE CRIED MRS MAYLIE RISING HASTILY AND BENDING OVER HER WHAT IS THIS IN TEARS MY DEAR CHILD WHAT DISTRESSES YOU

WHITENESS ITS EXPRESSION HAD LOST NOTHING OF ITS BEAUTY BUT IT WAS CHANGED AND THERE WAS AN ANXIOUS HAGGARD LOOK ABOUT THE GENTLE FACE WHICH IT HAD NEVER WORN BEFORE ANOTHER MINUTE AND IT WAS SUFFUSED WITH A CRIMSON FLUSH AND A HEAVY WILDNESS CAME OVER THE SOFT BLUE EYE AGAIN THIS DISAPPEARED LIKE THE SHADOW THROWN BY A PASSING CLOUD AND SHE WAS ONCE MORE DEADLY PALE OLIVER WHO WATCHED THE OLD LADY ANXIOUSLY OBSERVED THAT SHE WAS ALARMED BY THESE APPEARANCES AND SO IN TRUTH WAS HE BUT SEEING THAT SHE AFFECTED TO MAKE LIGHT OF THEM HE ENDEAVOURED TO DO THE SAME AND THEY SO FAR SUCCEEDED THAT WHEN

TO KNOW THAT IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE YOUNGEST AND BEST WHO ARE SPARED TO THOSE THAT LOVE THEM BUT THIS SHOULD GIVE US COMFORT IN OUR SORROW FOR HEAVEN IS JUST AND SUCH THINGS TEACH US IMPRESSIVELY THAT THERE IS A BRIGHTER WORLD THAN THIS AND THAT THE PASSAGE TO IT IS SPEEDY GODS WILL BE DONE I LOVE HER AND HE KNOWS HOW WELL OLIVER WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT AS MRS MAYLIE SAID THESE WORDS SHE CHECKED HER LAMENTATIONS AS THOUGH BY ONE EFFORT AND DRAWING HERSELF UP AS SHE SPOKE BECAME COMPOSED AND FIRM HE WAS STILL MORE ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT THIS FIRMNESS LASTED AND THAT UNDER ALL THE CARE AND WATCHING WHICH ENSUED MRS MAYLIE WAS EVER READY AND COLLECTED PERFORMING ALL THE DUTIES WHICH HAD DEVOLVED UPON HER STEADILY AND TO ALL EXTERNAL APPEARANCES EVEN CHEERFULLY BUT HE WAS YOUNG AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT STRONG MINDS ARE CAPABLE OF UNDER TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES HOW SHOULD HE WHEN THEIR POSSESSORS SO SELDOM KNOW THEMSELVES AN ANXIOUS NIGHT ENSUED WHEN MORNING CAME MRS MAYLIES PREDICTIONS WERE BUT TOO WELL VERIFIED ROSE WAS IN THE FIRST STAGE OF A HIGH AND DANGEROUS FEVER WE MUST BE ACTIVE OLIVER AND NOT GIVE WAY TO USELESS GRIEF SAID MRS MAYLIE LAYING HER FINGER ON HER LIP AS SHE LOOKED STEADILY INTO HIS FACE THIS LETTER MUST BE SENT WITH ALL POSSIBLE EXPEDITION TO MR LOSBERNE IT MUST BE CARRIED TO THE MARKETTOWN WHICH IS NOT MORE THAN FOUR MILES OFF BY THE FOOTPATH ACROSS THE FIELD AND THENCE DISPATCHED BY AN EXPRESS ON HORSEBACK STRAIGHT TO CHERTSEY THE PEOPLE AT THE INN WILL UNDERTAKE TO DO THIS AND I CAN TRUST TO YOU TO SEE IT DONE I KNOW OLIVER COULD MAKE NO REPLY BUT LOOKED HIS ANXIETY TO BE GONE AT ONCE HERE IS ANOTHER LETTER SAID MRS MAYLIE PAUSING TO REFLECT BUT WHETHER TO SEND IT NOW OR WAIT UNTIL I SEE HOW ROSE GOES ON I SCARCELY KNOW I WOULD NOT FORWARD IT UNLESS I FEARED THE WORST IS IT FOR CHERTSEY TOO MAAM INQUIRED OLIVER IMPATIENT TO EXECUTE HIS COMMISSION AND HOLDING OUT HIS TREMBLING HAND FOR THE LETTER NO REPLIED THE OLD LADY GIVING IT TO HIM MECHANICALLY OLIVER GLANCED AT IT AND SAW THAT IT WAS DIRECTED TO HARRY MAYLIE ESQUIRE AT SOME GREAT LORDS HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT SHALL IT GO MAAM ASKED OLIVER LOOKING UP IMPATIENTLY I THINK NOT REPLIED MRS MAYLIE TAKING IT BACK I WILL WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW WITH THESE WORDS SHE GAVE OLIVER HER PURSE AND HE STARTED OFF WITHOUT MORE DELAY AT THE GREATEST SPEED HE COULD MUSTER SWIFTLY HE RAN ACROSS THE FIELDS AND DOWN THE LITTLE LANES WHICH SOMETIMES DIVIDED THEM NOW ALMOST HIDDEN BY THE HIGH CORN ON EITHER SIDE AND NOW EMERGING ON AN OPEN FIELD WHERE THE MOWERS AND HAYMAKERS WERE BUSY AT THEIR WORK NOR DID HE STOP ONCE SAVE NOW AND THEN FOR A FEW SECONDS TO RECOVER BREATH UNTIL HE CAME IN A GREAT HEAT AND COVERED WITH DUST ON THE LITTLE MARKETPLACE OF THE MARKETTOWN HERE HE PAUSED AND LOOKED ABOUT FOR THE INN THERE WERE A WHITE BANK AND A RED BREWERY AND A YELLOW TOWNHALL AND IN ONE CORNER THERE WAS A LARGE HOUSE WITH ALL THE WOOD ABOUT IT PAINTED GREEN BEFORE WHICH WAS THE SIGN OF THE GEORGE TO THIS HE HASTENED AS SOON AS IT CAUGHT HIS EYE HE SPOKE TO A POSTBOY WHO WAS DOZING UNDER THE GATEWAY AND WHO AFTER HEARING WHAT HE WANTED REFERRED HIM TO THE OSTLER WHO AFTER HEARING ALL HE HAD TO SAY AGAIN REFERRED HIM TO THE LANDLORD WHO WAS A TALL GENTLEMAN IN A BLUE NECKCLOTH A WHITE HAT DRAB BREECHES AND BOOTS WITH TOPS TO MATCH LEANING AGAINST A PUMP BY THE STABLEDOOR PICKING HIS TEETH WITH A SILVER TOOTHPICK THIS GENTLEMAN WALKED WITH MUCH DELIBERATION INTO THE BAR TO MAKE OUT THE BILL WHICH TOOK A LONG TIME MAKING OUT AND AFTER IT WAS READY AND PAID A HORSE HAD TO BE SADDLED AND A MAN TO BE DRESSED WHICH TOOK UP TEN GOOD MINUTES MORE MEANWHILE OLIVER WAS IN SUCH A DESPERATE STATE OF IMPATIENCE AND ANXIETY THAT HE FELT AS IF HE COULD HAVE JUMPED UPON THE HORSE HIMSELF AND GALLOPED AWAY FULL TEAR TO THE NEXT STAGE AT LENGTH ALL WAS READY AND THE LITTLE PARCEL HAVING BEEN HANDED UP WITH MANY INJUNCTIONS AND ENTREATIES FOR ITS SPEEDY DELIVERY THE MAN SET SPURS TO HIS HORSE AND RATTLING OVER THE UNEVEN PAVING OF THE MARKETPLACE WAS OUT OF THE TOWN AND GALLOPING ALONG THE TURNPIKEROAD IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES AS IT WAS SOMETHING TO FEEL CERTAIN THAT ASSISTANCE WAS SENT FOR AND THAT NO TIME HAD BEEN LOST OLIVER HURRIED UP THE INNYARD WITH A SOMEWHAT LIGHTER HEART HE WAS TURNING OUT OF THE GATEWAY WHEN HE ACCIDENTLY STUMBLED AGAINST A TALL MAN WRAPPED IN A CLOAK WHO WAS AT THAT MOMENT COMING OUT OF THE INN DOOR HAH CRIED THE MAN FIXING HIS EYES ON OLIVER AND SUDDENLY RECOILING WHAT THE DEVILS THIS I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID OLIVER I WAS IN A GREAT HURRY TO GET HOME AND DIDNT SEE YOU WERE COMING DEATH MUTTERED THE MAN TO HIMSELF GLARING AT THE BOY WITH HIS LARGE DARK EYES WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT GRIND HIM TO ASHES HED START UP FROM A STONE COFFIN TO COME IN MY WAY I AM SORRY STAMMERED OLIVER CONFUSED BY THE STRANGE MANS WILD LOOK I HOPE I HAVE NOT HURT YOU ROT YOU MURMURED THE MAN IN A HORRIBLE PASSION BETWEEN HIS CLENCHED TEETH IF I HAD ONLY HAD THE COURAGE TO SAY THE WORD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN FREE OF YOU IN A NIGHT CURSES ON YOUR HEAD AND BLACK DEATH ON YOUR HEART YOU IMP WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE THE MAN SHOOK HIS FIST AS HE UTTERED THESE WORDS INCOHERENTLY HE ADVANCED TOWARDS OLIVER AS IF WITH THE INTENTION OF AIMING A BLOW AT HIM BUT FELL VIOLENTLY ON THE GROUND WRITHING AND FOAMING IN A FIT OLIVER GAZED FOR A MOMENT AT THE STRUGGLES OF THE MADMAN FOR SUCH HE SUPPOSED HIM TO BE AND THEN DARTED INTO THE HOUSE FOR HELP HAVING SEEN HIM SAFELY CARRIED INTO THE HOTEL HE TURNED HIS FACE HOMEWARDS RUNNING AS FAST AS HE COULD TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AND RECALLING WITH A GREAT DEAL OF ASTONISHMENT AND SOME FEAR THE EXTRAORDINARY BEHAVIOUR OF THE PERSON FROM WHOM HE HAD JUST PARTED THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID NOT DWELL IN HIS RECOLLECTION LONG HOWEVER FOR WHEN HE REACHED THE COTTAGE THERE WAS ENOUGH TO OCCUPY HIS MIND AND TO DRIVE ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF SELF COMPLETELY FROM HIS MEMORY ROSE MAYLIE HAD RAPIDLY GROWN WORSE BEFORE MIDNIGHT SHE WAS DELIRIOUS A MEDICAL PRACTITIONER WHO RESIDED ON THE SPOT WAS IN CONSTANT ATTENDANCE UPON HER AND AFTER FIRST SEEING THE PATIENT HE HAD TAKEN MRS MAYLIE ASIDE AND PRONOUNCED HER DISORDER TO BE ONE OF A MOST ALARMING NATURE IN FACT HE SAID IT WOULD BE LITTLE SHORT OF A MIRACLE IF SHE RECOVERED HOW OFTEN DID OLIVER START FROM HIS BED THAT NIGHT AND STEALING OUT WITH NOISELESS FOOTSTEP TO THE STAIRCASE LISTEN FOR THE SLIGHTEST SOUND FROM THE SICK CHAMBER HOW OFTEN DID A TREMBLE SHAKE HIS FRAME AND COLD DROPS OF TERROR START UPON HIS BROW WHEN A SUDDEN TRAMPLING OF FEET CAUSED HIM TO FEAR THAT SOMETHING TOO DREADFUL TO THINK OF HAD EVEN THEN OCCURRED AND WHAT HAD BEEN THE FERVENCY OF ALL THE PRAYERS HE HAD EVER MUTTERED COMPARED WITH THOSE HE POURED FORTH NOW IN THE AGONY AND PASSION OF HIS SUPPLICATION FOR THE LIFE AND HEALTH OF THE GENTLE CREATURE WHO WAS TOTTERING ON THE DEEP GRAVES VERGE OH THE SUSPENSE THE FEARFUL ACUTE SUSPENSE OF STANDING IDLY BY WHILE THE LIFE OF ONE WE DEARLY LOVE IS TREMBLING IN THE BALANCE OH THE RACKING THOUGHTS THAT CROWD UPON THE MIND AND MAKE THE HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY AND THE BREATH COME THICK BY THE FORCE OF THE IMAGES THEY CONJURE UP BEFORE IT THE DESPERATE ANXIETY TO BE DOING SOMETHING TO RELIEVE THE PAIN OR LESSEN THE DANGER WHICH WE HAVE NO POWER TO ALLEVIATE THE SINKING OF SOUL AND SPIRIT WHICH THE SAD REMEMBRANCE OF OUR HELPLESSNESS PRODUCES WHAT TORTURES CAN EQUAL THESE WHAT REFLECTIONS OR ENDEAVOURS CAN IN THE FULL TIDE AND FEVER OF THE TIME ALLAY THEM MORNING CAME AND THE LITTLE COTTAGE WAS LONELY AND STILL PEOPLE SPOKE IN WHISPERS ANXIOUS FACES APPEARED AT THE GATE FROM TIME TO TIME WOMEN AND CHILDREN WENT AWAY IN TEARS ALL THE LIVELONG DAY AND FOR HOURS AFTER IT HAD GROWN DARK OLIVER PACED SOFTLY UP AND DOWN THE GARDEN RAISING HIS EYES EVERY INSTANT TO THE SICK CHAMBER AND SHUDDERING TO SEE THE DARKENED WINDOW LOOKING AS IF DEATH LAY STRETCHED INSIDE LATE THAT NIGHT MR LOSBERNE ARRIVED IT IS HARD SAID THE GOOD DOCTOR TURNING AWAY AS HE SPOKE SO YOUNG SO MUCH BELOVED BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE HOPE ANOTHER MORNING THE SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY AS BRIGHTLY AS IF IT LOOKED UPON NO MISERY OR CARE AND WITH EVERY LEAF AND FLOWER IN FULL BLOOM ABOUT HER WITH LIFE AND HEALTH AND SOUNDS AND SIGHTS OF JOY SURROUNDING HER ON EVERY SIDE THE FAIR YOUNG CREATURE LAY WASTING FAST OLIVER CREPT AWAY TO THE OLD CHURCHYARD AND SITTING DOWN ON ONE OF THE GREEN MOUNDS WEPT AND PRAYED FOR HER IN SILENCE THERE WAS SUCH PEACE AND BEAUTY IN THE SCENE SO MUCH OF BRIGHTNESS AND MIRTH IN THE SUNNY LANDSCAPE SUCH BLITHESOME MUSIC IN THE SONGS OF THE SUMMER BIRDS SUCH FREEDOM IN THE RAPID FLIGHT OF THE ROOK CAREERING OVERHEAD SO MUCH OF LIFE AND JOYOUSNESS IN ALL THAT WHEN THE BOY RAISED HIS ACHING EYES AND LOOKED ABOUT THE THOUGHT INSTINCTIVELY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THIS WAS NOT A TIME FOR DEATH THAT ROSE COULD SURELY NEVER DIE WHEN HUMBLER THINGS WERE ALL SO GLAD AND GAY THAT GRAVES WERE FOR COLD AND CHEERLESS WINTER NOT FOR SUNLIGHT AND FRAGRANCE HE ALMOST THOUGHT THAT SHROUDS WERE FOR THE OLD AND SHRUNKEN AND THAT THEY NEVER WRAPPED THE YOUNG AND GRACEFUL FORM IN THEIR GHASTLY FOLDS A KNELL FROM THE CHURCH BELL BROKE HARSHLY ON THESE YOUTHFUL THOUGHTS ANOTHER AGAIN IT WAS TOLLING FOR THE FUNERAL SERVICE A GROUP OF HUMBLE MOURNERS ENTERED THE GATE WEARING WHITE FAVOURS FOR THE CORPSE WAS YOUNG THEY STOOD UNCOVERED BY A GRAVE AND THERE WAS A MOTHERA MOTHER ONCEAMONG THE WEEPING TRAIN BUT THE SUN SHONE BRIGHTLY AND THE BIRDS SANG ON OLIVER TURNED HOMEWARD THINKING ON THE MANY KINDNESSES HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE YOUNG LADY AND WISHING THAT THE TIME COULD COME AGAIN THAT HE MIGHT NEVER CEASE SHOWING HER HOW GRATEFUL AND ATTACHED HE WAS HE HAD NO CAUSE FOR SELFREPROACH ON THE SCORE OF NEGLECT OR WANT OF THOUGHT FOR HE HAD BEEN DEVOTED TO HER SERVICE AND YET A HUNDRED LITTLE OCCASIONS ROSE UP BEFORE HIM ON WHICH HE FANCIED HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE ZEALOUS AND MORE EARNEST AND WISHED HE HAD BEEN WE NEED BE CAREFUL HOW WE DEAL WITH THOSE ABOUT US WHEN EVERY DEATH CARRIES TO SOME SMALL CIRCLE OF SURVIVORS THOUGHTS OF SO MUCH OMITTED AND SO LITTLE DONEOF SO MANY THINGS FORGOTTEN AND SO MANY MORE WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN REPAIRED THERE IS NO REMORSE SO DEEP AS THAT WHICH IS UNAVAILING IF WE WOULD BE SPARED ITS TORTURES LET US REMEMBER THIS IN TIME WHEN HE REACHED HOME MRS MAYLIE WAS SITTING IN THE LITTLE PARLOUR OLIVERS HEART SANK AT SIGHT OF HER FOR SHE HAD NEVER LEFT THE BEDSIDE OF HER NIECE AND HE TREMBLED TO THINK WHAT CHANGE COULD HAVE DRIVEN HER AWAY HE LEARNT THAT SHE HAD FALLEN INTO A DEEP SLEEP FROM WHICH SHE WOULD WAKEN EITHER TO RECOVERY AND LIFE OR TO BID THEM FAREWELL AND DIE THEY SAT LISTENING AND AFRAID TO SPEAK FOR HOURS THE UNTASTED MEAL WAS REMOVED WITH LOOKS WHICH SHOWED THAT THEIR THOUGHTS WERE ELSEWHERE THEY WATCHED THE SUN AS HE SANK LOWER AND LOWER AND AT LENGTH CAST OVER SKY AND EARTH THOSE BRILLIANT HUES WHICH HERALD HIS DEPARTURE THEIR QUICK EARS CAUGHT THE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING FOOTSTEP THEY BOTH INVOLUNTARILY DARTED TO THE DOOR AS MR LOSBERNE ENTERED WHAT OF ROSE CRIED THE OLD LADY TELL ME AT ONCE I CAN BEAR IT ANYTHING BUT SUSPENSE OH TELL ME IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN YOU MUST COMPOSE YOURSELF SAID THE DOCTOR SUPPORTING HER BE CALM MY DEAR MAAM PRAY LET ME GO IN GODS NAME MY DEAR CHILD SHE IS DEAD SHE IS DYING NO CRIED THE DOCTOR PASSIONATELY AS HE IS GOOD AND MERCIFUL SHE WILL LIVE TO BLESS US ALL FOR YEARS TO COME THE LADY FELL UPON HER KNEES AND TRIED TO FOLD HER HANDS TOGETHER BUT THE ENERGY WHICH HAD SUPPORTED HER SO LONG FLED UP TO HEAVEN WITH HER FIRST THANKSGIVING AND SHE SANK INTO THE FRIENDLY ARMS WHICH WERE EXTENDED TO RECEIVE HER CHAPTER XXXIV CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER IT WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH HAPPINESS TO BEAR OLIVER FELT STUNNED AND STUPEFIED BY THE UNEXPECTED INTELLIGENCE HE COULD NOT WEEP OR SPEAK OR REST HE HAD SCARCELY THE POWER OF UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING THAT HAD PASSED UNTIL AFTER A LONG RAMBLE IN THE QUIET EVENING AIR A BURST OF TEARS CAME TO HIS RELIEF AND HE SEEMED TO AWAKEN ALL AT ONCE TO A FULL SENSE OF THE JOYFUL CHANGE THAT HAD OCCURRED AND THE ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE LOAD OF ANGUISH WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIS BREAST THE NIGHT WAS FAST CLOSING IN WHEN HE RETURNED HOMEWARD LADEN WITH FLOWERS WHICH HE HAD CULLED WITH PECULIAR CARE FOR THE ADORNMENT OF THE SICK CHAMBER AS HE WALKED BRISKLY ALONG THE ROAD HE HEARD BEHIND HIM THE NOISE OF SOME VEHICLE APPROACHING AT A FURIOUS PACE LOOKING ROUND HE SAW THAT IT WAS A POSTCHAISE DRIVEN AT GREAT SPEED AND AS THE HORSES WERE GALLOPING AND THE ROAD WAS NARROW HE STOOD LEANING AGAINST A GATE UNTIL IT SHOULD HAVE PASSED HIM AS IT DASHED ON OLIVER CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A MAN IN A WHITE NIGHTCAP WHOSE FACE SEEMED FAMILIAR TO HIM ALTHOUGH HIS VIEW WAS SO BRIEF THAT HE COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE PERSON IN ANOTHER SECOND OR TWO THE NIGHTCAP WAS THRUST OUT OF THE CHAISEWINDOW AND A STENTORIAN VOICE BELLOWED TO THE DRIVER TO STOP WHICH HE DID AS SOON AS HE COULD PULL UP HIS HORSES THEN THE NIGHTCAP ONCE AGAIN APPEARED AND THE SAME VOICE CALLED OLIVER BY HIS NAME HERE CRIED THE VOICE OLIVER WHATS THE NEWS MISS ROSE MASTER OLIVER IS IT YOU GILES CRIED OLIVER RUNNING UP TO THE CHAISEDOOR GILES POPPED OUT HIS NIGHTCAP AGAIN PREPARATORY TO MAKING SOME REPLY WHEN HE WAS SUDDENLY PULLED BACK BY A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO OCCUPIED THE OTHER CORNER OF THE CHAISE AND WHO EAGERLY DEMANDED WHAT WAS THE NEWS IN A WORD CRIED THE GENTLEMAN BETTER OR WORSE BETTERMUCH BETTER REPLIED OLIVER HASTILY THANK HEAVEN EXCLAIMED THE GENTLEMAN YOU ARE SURE QUITE SIR REPLIED OLIVER THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE ONLY A FEW HOURS AGO AND MR LOSBERNE SAYS THAT ALL DANGER IS AT AN END THE GENTLEMAN SAID NOT ANOTHER WORD BUT OPENING THE CHAISEDOOR LEAPED OUT AND TAKING OLIVER HURRIEDLY BY THE ARM LED HIM ASIDE YOU ARE QUITE CERTAIN THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF ANY MISTAKE ON YOUR PART MY BOY IS THERE DEMANDED THE GENTLEMAN IN A TREMULOUS VOICE DO NOT DECEIVE ME BY AWAKENING HOPES THAT ARE NOT TO BE FULFILLED I WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD SIR REPLIED OLIVER INDEED YOU MAY BELIEVE ME MR LOSBERNES WORDS WERE THAT SHE WOULD LIVE TO BLESS US ALL FOR MANY YEARS TO COME I HEARD HIM SAY SO THE TEARS STOOD IN OLIVERS EYES AS HE RECALLED THE SCENE WHICH WAS THE BEGINNING OF SO MUCH HAPPINESS AND THE GENTLEMAN TURNED HIS FACE AWAY AND REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME MINUTES OLIVER THOUGHT HE HEARD HIM SOB MORE THAN ONCE BUT HE FEARED TO INTERRUPT HIM BY ANY FRESH REMARKFOR HE COULD WELL GUESS WHAT HIS FEELINGS WEREAND SO STOOD APART FEIGNING TO BE OCCUPIED WITH HIS NOSEGAY ALL THIS TIME MR GILES WITH THE WHITE NIGHTCAP ON HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE STEPS OF THE CHAISE SUPPORTING AN ELBOW ON EACH KNEE AND WIPING HIS EYES WITH A BLUE COTTON POCKETHANDKERCHIEF DOTTED WITH WHITE SPOTS THAT THE HONEST FELLOW HAD NOT BEEN FEIGNING EMOTION WAS ABUNDANTLY DEMONSTRATED BY THE VERY RED EYES WITH WHICH HE REGARDED THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHEN HE TURNED ROUND AND ADDRESSED HIM I THINK YOU HAD BETTER GO ON TO MY MOTHERS IN THE CHAISE GILES SAID HE I WOULD RATHER WALK SLOWLY ON SO AS TO GAIN A LITTLE TIME BEFORE I SEE HER YOU CAN SAY I AM COMING I BEG YOUR PARDON MR HARRY SAID GILES GIVING A FINAL POLISH TO HIS RUFFLED COUNTENANCE WITH THE HANDKERCHIEF BUT IF YOU WOULD LEAVE THE POSTBOY TO SAY THAT I SHOULD BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU IT WOULDNT BE PROPER FOR THE MAIDS TO SEE ME IN THIS STATE SIR I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ANY MORE AUTHORITY WITH THEM IF THEY DID WELL REJOINED HARRY MAYLIE SMILING YOU CAN DO AS YOU LIKE LET HIM GO ON WITH THE LUGGAGE IF YOU WISH IT AND DO YOU FOLLOW WITH US ONLY FIRST EXCHANGE THAT NIGHTCAP FOR SOME MORE APPROPRIATE COVERING OR WE SHALL BE TAKEN FOR MADMEN MR GILES REMINDED OF HIS UNBECOMING COSTUME SNATCHED OFF AND POCKETED HIS NIGHTCAP AND SUBSTITUTED A HAT OF GRAVE AND SOBER SHAPE WHICH HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHAISE THIS DONE THE POSTBOY DROVE OFF GILES MR MAYLIE AND OLIVER FOLLOWED AT THEIR LEISURE AS THEY WALKED ALONG OLIVER GLANCED FROM TIME TO TIME WITH MUCH INTEREST AND CURIOSITY AT THE NEW COMER HE SEEMED ABOUT FIVEANDTWENTY YEARS OF AGE AND WAS OF THE MIDDLE HEIGHT HIS COUNTENANCE WAS FRANK AND HANDSOME AND HIS DEMEANOR EASY AND PREPOSSESSING NOTWITHSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUTH AND AGE HE BORE SO STRONG A LIKENESS TO THE OLD LADY THAT OLIVER WOULD HAVE HAD NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN IMAGINING THEIR RELATIONSHIP IF HE HAD NOT ALREADY SPOKEN OF HER AS HIS MOTHER MRS MAYLIE WAS ANXIOUSLY WAITING TO RECEIVE HER SON WHEN HE REACHED THE COTTAGE THE MEETING DID NOT TAKE PLACE WITHOUT GREAT EMOTION ON BOTH SIDES MOTHER WHISPERED THE YOUNG MAN WHY DID YOU NOT WRITE BEFORE I DID REPLIED MRS MAYLIE BUT ON REFLECTION I DETERMINED TO KEEP BACK THE LETTER UNTIL I HAD HEARD MR LOSBERNES OPINION BUT WHY SAID THE YOUNG MAN WHY RUN THE CHANCE OF THAT OCCURRING WHICH SO NEARLY HAPPENED IF ROSE HADI CANNOT UTTER THAT WORD NOWIF THIS ILLNESS HAD TERMINATED DIFFERENTLY HOW COULD YOU EVER HAVE FORGIVEN YOURSELF HOW COULD I EVER HAVE KNOW HAPPINESS AGAIN IF THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE HARRY SAID MRS MAYLIE I FEAR YOUR HAPPINESS WOULD HAVE BEEN EFFECTUALLY BLIGHTED AND THAT YOUR ARRIVAL HERE A DAY SOONER OR A DAY LATER WOULD HAVE BEEN OF VERY VERY LITTLE IMPORT AND WHO CAN WONDER IF IT BE SO MOTHER REJOINED THE YOUNG MAN OR WHY SHOULD I SAY IFIT ISIT ISYOU KNOW IT MOTHERYOU MUST KNOW IT I KNOW THAT SHE DESERVES THE BEST AND PUREST LOVE THE HEART OF MAN CAN OFFER SAID MRS MAYLIE I KNOW THAT THE DEVOTION AND AFFECTION OF HER NATURE REQUIRE NO ORDINARY RETURN BUT ONE THAT SHALL BE DEEP AND LASTING IF I DID NOT FEEL THIS AND KNOW BESIDES THAT A CHANGED BEHAVIOUR IN ONE SHE LOVED WOULD BREAK HER HEART I SHOULD NOT FEEL MY TASK SO DIFFICULT OF PERFORMANCE OR HAVE TO ENCOUNTER SO MANY STRUGGLES IN MY OWN BOSOM WHEN I TAKE WHAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE THE STRICT LINE OF DUTY THIS IS UNKIND MOTHER SAID HARRY DO YOU STILL SUPPOSE THAT I AM A BOY IGNORANT OF MY OWN MIND AND MISTAKING THE IMPULSES OF MY OWN SOUL I THINK MY DEAR SON RETURNED MRS MAYLIE LAYING HER HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER THAT YOUTH HAS MANY GENEROUS IMPULSES WHICH DO NOT LAST AND THAT AMONG THEM ARE SOME WHICH BEING GRATIFIED BECOME ONLY THE MORE FLEETING ABOVE ALL I THINK SAID THE LADY FIXING HER EYES ON HER SONS FACE THAT IF AN ENTHUSIASTIC ARDENT AND AMBITIOUS MAN MARRY A WIFE ON WHOSE NAME THERE IS A STAIN WHICH THOUGH IT ORIGINATE IN NO FAULT OF HERS MAY BE VISITED BY COLD AND SORDID PEOPLE UPON HER AND UPON HIS CHILDREN ALSO AND IN EXACT PROPORTION TO HIS SUCCESS IN THE WORLD BE CAST IN HIS TEETH AND MADE THE SUBJECT OF SNEERS AGAINST HIM HE MAY NO MATTER HOW GENEROUS AND GOOD HIS NATURE ONE DAY REPENT OF THE CONNECTION HE FORMED IN EARLY LIFE AND SHE MAY HAVE THE PAIN OF KNOWING THAT HE DOES SO MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG MAN IMPATIENTLY HE WOULD BE A SELFISH BRUTE UNWORTHY ALIKE OF THE NAME OF MAN AND OF THE WOMAN YOU DESCRIBE WHO ACTED THUS YOU THINK SO NOW HARRY REPLIED HIS MOTHER AND EVER WILL SAID THE YOUNG MAN THE MENTAL AGONY I HAVE SUFFERED DURING THE LAST TWO DAYS WRINGS FROM ME THE AVOWAL TO YOU OF A PASSION WHICH AS YOU WELL KNOW IS NOT ONE OF YESTERDAY NOR ONE I HAVE LIGHTLY FORMED ON ROSE SWEET GENTLE GIRL MY HEART IS SET AS FIRMLY AS EVER HEART OF MAN

BETTER OF THIS AND OF ME AND DO NOT DISREGARD THE HAPPINESS OF WHICH YOU SEEM TO THINK SO LITTLE HARRY SAID MRS MAYLIE IT IS BECAUSE I THINK SO MUCH OF WARM AND SENSITIVE HEARTS THAT I WOULD SPARE THEM FROM BEING WOUNDED BUT WE HAVE SAID ENOUGH AND MORE THAN ENOUGH ON THIS MATTER JUST NOW LET IT REST WITH ROSE THEN INTERPOSED HARRY YOU WILL NOT PRESS THESE OVERSTRAINED OPINIONS OF YOURS SO FAR AS TO THROW ANY OBSTACLE IN MY WAY I WILL NOT REJOINED MRS MAYLIE BUT I WOULD HAVE YOU CONSIDER I HAVE CONSIDERED WAS THE IMPATIENT REPLY MOTHER I HAVE CONSIDERED YEARS AND YEARS I HAVE CONSIDERED EVER SINCE I HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF SERIOUS REFLECTION MY FEELINGS REMAIN UNCHANGED AS THEY EVER WILL AND WHY SHOULD I SUFFER THE PAIN OF A DELAY IN GIVING THEM VENT WHICH CAN BE PRODUCTIVE OF NO EARTHLY GOOD NO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE ROSE SHALL HEAR ME SHE SHALL SAID MRS MAYLIE THERE IS SOMETHING IN YOUR MANNER WHICH WOULD ALMOST IMPLY THAT SHE WILL HEAR ME COLDLY MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG MAN NOT COLDLY REJOINED THE OLD LADY FAR FROM IT HOW THEN URGED THE YOUNG MAN SHE HAS FORMED NO OTHER ATTACHMENT NO INDEED REPLIED HIS MOTHER YOU HAVE OR I MISTAKE TOO STRONG A HOLD ON HER AFFECTIONS ALREADY WHAT I WOULD SAY RESUMED THE OLD LADY STOPPING HER SON AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK IS THIS BEFORE YOU STAKE YOUR ALL ON THIS CHANCE BEFORE YOU SUFFER YOURSELF TO BE CARRIED TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF HOPE REFLECT FOR A FEW MOMENTS MY DEAR CHILD ON ROSES HISTORY AND CONSIDER WHAT EFFECT THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER DOUBTFUL BIRTH MAY HAVE ON HER DECISION DEVOTED AS SHE IS TO US WITH ALL THE INTENSITY OF HER NOBLE MIND AND WITH THAT PERFECT SACRIFICE OF SELF WHICH IN ALL MATTERS GREAT OR TRIFLING HAS ALWAYS BEEN HER CHARACTERISTIC WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT I LEAVE YOU TO DISCOVER REPLIED MRS MAYLIE I MUST GO BACK TO HER GOD BLESS YOU I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN TONIGHT SAID THE YOUNG MAN EAGERLY BY AND BY REPLIED THE LADY WHEN I LEAVE ROSE YOU WILL TELL HER I AM HERE SAID HARRY OF COURSE REPLIED MRS MAYLIE AND SAY HOW ANXIOUS I HAVE BEEN AND HOW MUCH I HAVE SUFFERED AND HOW I LONG TO SEE HER YOU WILL NOT REFUSE TO DO THIS MOTHER NO SAID THE OLD LADY I WILL TELL HER ALL AND PRESSING HER SONS HAND AFFECTIONATELY SHE HASTENED FROM THE ROOM MR LOSBERNE AND OLIVER HAD REMAINED AT ANOTHER END OF THE APARTMENT WHILE THIS HURRIED CONVERSATION WAS PROCEEDING THE FORMER NOW HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HARRY MAYLIE AND HEARTY SALUTATIONS WERE EXCHANGED BETWEEN THEM THE DOCTOR THEN COMMUNICATED IN REPLY TO MULTIFARIOUS QUESTIONS FROM HIS YOUNG FRIEND A PRECISE ACCOUNT OF HIS PATIENTS SITUATION WHICH WAS QUITE AS CONSOLATORY AND FULL OF PROMISE AS OLIVERS STATEMENT HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE AND TO THE WHOLE OF WHICH MR GILES WHO AFFECTED TO BE BUSY ABOUT THE LUGGAGE LISTENED WITH GREEDY EARS HAVE YOU SHOT ANYTHING PARTICULAR LATELY GILES INQUIRED THE DOCTOR WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED NOTHING PARTICULAR SIR REPLIED MR GILES COLOURING UP TO THE EYES NOR CATCHING ANY THIEVES NOR IDENTIFYING ANY HOUSEBREAKERS SAID THE DOCTOR NONE AT ALL SIR REPLIED MR GILES WITH MUCH GRAVITY WELL SAID THE DOCTOR I AM SORRY TO HEAR IT BECAUSE YOU DO THAT SORT OF THING ADMIRABLY PRAY HOW IS BRITTLES THE BOY IS VERY WELL SIR SAID MR GILES RECOVERING HIS USUAL TONE OF PATRONAGE AND SENDS HIS RESPECTFUL DUTY SIR THATS WELL SAID THE DOCTOR SEEING YOU HERE REMINDS ME MR GILES THAT ON THE DAY BEFORE THAT ON WHICH I WAS CALLED AWAY SO HURRIEDLY I EXECUTED AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR GOOD MISTRESS A SMALL COMMISSION IN YOUR FAVOUR JUST STEP INTO THIS CORNER A MOMENT WILL YOU MR GILES WALKED INTO THE CORNER WITH MUCH IMPORTANCE AND SOME WONDER AND WAS HONOURED WITH A SHORT WHISPERING CONFERENCE WITH THE DOCTOR ON THE TERMINATION OF WHICH HE MADE A GREAT MANY BOWS AND RETIRED WITH STEPS OF UNUSUAL STATELINESS THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS CONFERENCE WAS NOT DISCLOSED IN THE PARLOUR BUT THE KITCHEN WAS SPEEDILY ENLIGHTENED CONCERNING IT FOR MR GILES WALKED STRAIGHT THITHER AND HAVING CALLED FOR A MUG OF ALE ANNOUNCED WITH AN AIR OF MAJESTY WHICH WAS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE THAT IT HAD PLEASED HIS MISTRESS IN CONSIDERATION OF HIS GALLANT BEHAVIOUR ON THE OCCASION OF THAT ATTEMPTED ROBBERY TO DEPOSIT IN THE LOCAL SAVINGSBANK THE SUM OF FIVEANDTWENTY POUNDS FOR HIS SOLE USE AND BENEFIT AT THIS THE TWO WOMENSERVANTS LIFTED UP THEIR HANDS AND EYES AND SUPPOSED THAT MR GILES PULLING OUT HIS SHIRTFRILL REPLIED NO NO AND THAT IF THEY OBSERVED THAT HE WAS AT ALL HAUGHTY TO HIS INFERIORS HE WOULD THANK THEM TO TELL HIM SO AND THEN HE MADE A GREAT MANY OTHER REMARKS NO LESS ILLUSTRATIVE OF HIS HUMILITY WHICH WERE RECEIVED WITH EQUAL FAVOUR AND APPLAUSE AND WERE WITHAL AS ORIGINAL AND AS MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AS THE REMARKS OF GREAT MEN COMMONLY ARE ABOVE STAIRS THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY FOR THE DOCTOR WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AND HOWEVER FATIGUED OR THOUGHTFUL HARRY MAYLIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT FIRST HE WAS NOT PROOF AGAINST THE WORTHY GENTLEMANS GOOD HUMOUR WHICH DISPLAYED ITSELF IN A GREAT VARIETY OF SALLIES AND PROFESSIONAL RECOLLECTIONS AND AN ABUNDANCE OF SMALL JOKES WHICH STRUCK OLIVER AS BEING THE DROLLEST THINGS HE HAD EVER HEARD AND CAUSED HIM TO LAUGH PROPORTIONATELY TO THE EVIDENT SATISFACTION OF THE DOCTOR WHO LAUGHED IMMODERATELY AT HIMSELF AND MADE HARRY LAUGH ALMOST AS HEARTILY BY THE VERY FORCE OF SYMPATHY SO THEY WERE AS PLEASANT A PARTY AS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY COULD WELL HAVE BEEN AND IT WAS LATE BEFORE THEY RETIRED WITH LIGHT AND THANKFUL HEARTS TO TAKE THAT REST OF WHICH AFTER THE DOUBT AND SUSPENSE THEY HAD RECENTLY UNDERGONE THEY STOOD MUCH IN NEED OLIVER ROSE NEXT MORNING IN BETTER HEART AND WENT ABOUT HIS USUAL OCCUPATIONS WITH MORE HOPE AND PLEASURE THAN HE HAD KNOWN FOR MANY DAYS THE BIRDS WERE ONCE MORE HUNG OUT TO SING IN THEIR OLD PLACES AND THE SWEETEST WILD FLOWERS THAT COULD BE FOUND WERE ONCE MORE GATHERED TO GLADDEN ROSE WITH THEIR BEAUTY THE MELANCHOLY WHICH HAD SEEMED TO THE SAD EYES OF THE ANXIOUS BOY TO HANG FOR DAYS PAST OVER EVERY OBJECT BEAUTIFUL AS ALL WERE WAS DISPELLED BY MAGIC THE DEW SEEMED TO SPARKLE MORE BRIGHTLY ON THE GREEN LEAVES THE AIR TO RUSTLE AMONG THEM WITH A SWEETER MUSIC AND THE SKY ITSELF TO LOOK MORE BLUE AND BRIGHT SUCH IS THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE CONDITION OF OUR OWN THOUGHTS EXERCISE EVEN OVER THE APPEARANCE OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS MEN WHO LOOK ON NATURE AND THEIR FELLOWMEN AND CRY THAT ALL IS DARK AND GLOOMY ARE IN THE RIGHT BUT THE SOMBRE COLOURS ARE REFLECTIONS FROM THEIR OWN JAUNDICED EYES AND HEARTS THE REAL HUES ARE DELICATE AND NEED A CLEARER VISION IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK AND OLIVER DID NOT FAIL TO NOTE IT AT THE TIME THAT HIS MORNING EXPEDITIONS WERE NO LONGER MADE ALONE HARRY MAYLIE AFTER THE VERY FIRST MORNING WHEN HE MET OLIVER COMING LADEN HOME WAS SEIZED WITH SUCH A PASSION FOR FLOWERS AND DISPLAYED SUCH A TASTE IN THEIR ARRANGEMENT AS LEFT HIS YOUNG COMPANION FAR BEHIND IF OLIVER WERE BEHINDHAND IN THESE RESPECTS HE KNEW WHERE THE BEST WERE TO BE FOUND AND MORNING AFTER MORNING THEY SCOURED THE COUNTRY TOGETHER AND BROUGHT HOME THE FAIREST THAT BLOSSOMED THE WINDOW OF THE YOUNG LADYS CHAMBER WAS OPENED NOW FOR SHE LOVED TO FEEL THE RICH SUMMER AIR STREAM IN AND REVIVE HER WITH ITS FRESHNESS BUT THERE ALWAYS STOOD IN WATER JUST INSIDE THE LATTICE ONE PARTICULAR LITTLE BUNCH WHICH WAS MADE UP WITH GREAT CARE EVERY MORNING OLIVER COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT THE WITHERED FLOWERS WERE NEVER THROWN AWAY ALTHOUGH THE LITTLE VASE WAS REGULARLY REPLENISHED NOR COULD HE HELP OBSERVING THAT WHENEVER THE DOCTOR CAME INTO THE GARDEN HE INVARIABLY CAST HIS EYES UP TO THAT PARTICULAR CORNER AND NODDED HIS HEAD MOST EXPRESSIVELY AS HE SET FORTH ON HIS MORNINGS WALK PENDING THESE OBSERVATIONS THE DAYS WERE FLYING BY AND ROSE WAS RAPIDLY RECOVERING NOR DID OLIVERS TIME HANG HEAVY ON HIS HANDS ALTHOUGH THE YOUNG LADY HAD NOT YET LEFT HER CHAMBER AND THERE WERE NO EVENING WALKS SAVE NOW AND THEN FOR A SHORT DISTANCE WITH MRS MAYLIE HE APPLIED HIMSELF WITH REDOUBLED ASSIDUITY TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE WHITEHEADED OLD GENTLEMAN AND LABOURED SO HARD THAT HIS QUICK PROGRESS SURPRISED EVEN HIMSELF IT WAS WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED IN THIS PURSUIT THAT HE WAS GREATLY STARTLED AND DISTRESSED BY A MOST UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE THE LITTLE ROOM IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SIT WHEN BUSY AT HIS BOOKS WAS ON THE GROUNDFLOOR AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE IT WAS QUITE A COTTAGEROOM WITH A LATTICEWINDOW AROUND WHICH WERE CLUSTERS OF JESSAMINE AND HONEYSUCKLE THAT CREPT OVER THE CASEMENT AND FILLED THE PLACE WITH THEIR DELICIOUS PERFUME IT LOOKED INTO A GARDEN WHENCE A WICKETGATE OPENED INTO A SMALL PADDOCK ALL BEYOND WAS FINE MEADOWLAND AND WOOD THERE WAS NO OTHER DWELLING NEAR IN THAT DIRECTION AND THE PROSPECT IT COMMANDED WAS VERY EXTENSIVE ONE BEAUTIFUL EVENING WHEN THE FIRST SHADES OF TWILIGHT WERE BEGINNING TO SETTLE UPON THE EARTH OLIVER SAT AT THIS WINDOW INTENT UPON HIS BOOKS HE HAD BEEN PORING OVER THEM FOR SOME TIME AND AS THE DAY HAD BEEN UNCOMMONLY SULTRY AND HE HAD EXERTED HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL IT IS NO DISPARAGEMENT TO THE AUTHORS WHOEVER THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TO SAY THAT GRADUALLY AND BY SLOW DEGREES HE FELL ASLEEP THERE IS A KIND OF SLEEP THAT STEALS UPON US SOMETIMES WHICH WHILE IT HOLDS THE BODY PRISONER DOES NOT FREE THE MIND FROM A SENSE OF THINGS ABOUT IT AND ENABLE IT TO RAMBLE AT ITS PLEASURE SO FAR AS AN OVERPOWERING HEAVINESS A PROSTRATION OF STRENGTH AND AN UTTER INABILITY TO CONTROL OUR THOUGHTS OR POWER OF MOTION CAN BE CALLED SLEEP THIS IS IT AND YET WE HAVE A CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THAT IS GOING ON ABOUT US AND IF WE DREAM AT SUCH A TIME WORDS WHICH ARE REALLY SPOKEN OR SOUNDS WHICH REALLY EXIST AT THE MOMENT ACCOMMODATE THEMSELVES WITH SURPRISING READINESS TO OUR VISIONS UNTIL REALITY AND IMAGINATION BECOME SO STRANGELY BLENDED THAT IT IS AFTERWARDS ALMOST MATTER OF IMPOSSIBILITY TO SEPARATE THE TWO NOR IS THIS THE MOST STRIKING PHENOMENON INCIDENTAL TO SUCH A STATE IT IS AN UNDOUBTED FACT THAT ALTHOUGH OUR SENSES OF TOUCH AND SIGHT BE FOR THE TIME DEAD YET OUR SLEEPING THOUGHTS AND THE VISIONARY SCENES THAT PASS BEFORE US WILL BE INFLUENCED AND MATERIALLY INFLUENCED BY THE MERE SILENT PRESENCE OF SOME EXTERNAL OBJECT WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN NEAR US WHEN WE CLOSED OUR EYES AND OF WHOSE VICINITY WE HAVE HAD NO WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS OLIVER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE WAS IN HIS OWN LITTLE ROOM THAT HIS BOOKS WERE LYING ON THE TABLE BEFORE HIM THAT THE SWEET AIR WAS STIRRING AMONG THE CREEPING PLANTS OUTSIDE AND YET HE WAS ASLEEP SUDDENLY THE SCENE CHANGED THE AIR BECAME CLOSE AND CONFINED AND HE THOUGHT WITH A GLOW OF TERROR THAT HE WAS IN THE JEWS HOUSE AGAIN THERE SAT THE HIDEOUS OLD MAN IN HIS ACCUSTOMED CORNER POINTING AT HIM AND WHISPERING TO ANOTHER MAN WITH HIS FACE AVERTED WHO SAT BESIDE HIM HUSH MY DEAR HE THOUGHT HE HEARD THE JEW SAY IT IS HE SURE ENOUGH COME AWAY HE THE OTHER MAN SEEMED TO ANSWER COULD I MISTAKE HIM THINK YOU IF A CROWD OF GHOSTS WERE TO PUT THEMSELVES INTO HIS EXACT SHAPE AND HE STOOD AMONGST THEM THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD TELL ME HOW TO POINT HIM OUT IF YOU BURIED HIM FIFTY FEET DEEP AND TOOK ME ACROSS HIS GRAVE I FANCY I SHOULD KNOW IF THERE WASNT A MARK ABOVE IT THAT HE LAY BURIED THERE THE MAN SEEMED TO SAY THIS WITH SUCH DREADFUL HATRED THAT OLIVER AWOKE WITH THE FEAR AND STARTED UP GOOD HEAVEN WHAT WAS THAT WHICH SENT THE BLOOD TINGLING TO HIS HEART AND DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS VOICE AND OF POWER TO MOVE THERETHEREAT THE WINDOWCLOSE BEFORE HIMSO CLOSE THAT HE COULD HAVE ALMOST TOUCHED HIM BEFORE HE STARTED BACK WITH HIS EYES PEERING INTO THE ROOM AND MEETING HIS THERE STOOD THE JEW AND BESIDE HIM WHITE WITH RAGE OR FEAR OR BOTH WERE THE SCOWLING FEATURES OF THE MAN WHO HAD ACCOSTED HIM IN THE INNYARD IT WAS BUT AN INSTANT A GLANCE A FLASH BEFORE HIS EYES AND THEY WERE GONE BUT THEY HAD RECOGNISED HIM AND HE THEM AND THEIR LOOK WAS AS FIRMLY IMPRESSED UPON HIS MEMORY AS IF IT HAD BEEN DEEPLY CARVED IN STONE AND SET BEFORE HIM FROM HIS BIRTH HE STOOD TRANSFIXED FOR A MOMENT THEN LEAPING FROM THE WINDOW INTO THE GARDEN CALLED LOUDLY FOR HELP CHAPTER XXXV CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVERS ADVENTURE AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE WHEN THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE ATTRACTED BY OLIVERS CRIES HURRIED TO THE SPOT FROM WHICH THEY PROCEEDED THEY FOUND HIM PALE AND AGITATED POINTING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MEADOWS BEHIND THE HOUSE AND SCARCELY ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE WORDS THE JEW THE JEW MR GILES WAS AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND WHAT THIS OUTCRY MEANT BUT HARRY MAYLIE WHOSE PERCEPTIONS WERE SOMETHING QUICKER AND WHO HAD HEARD OLIVERS HISTORY FROM HIS MOTHER UNDERSTOOD IT AT ONCE WHAT DIRECTION DID HE TAKE HE ASKED CATCHING UP A HEAVY STICK WHICH WAS STANDING IN A CORNER THAT REPLIED OLIVER POINTING OUT THE COURSE THE MAN HAD TAKEN I MISSED THEM IN AN INSTANT THEN THEY ARE IN THE DITCH SAID HARRY FOLLOW AND KEEP AS NEAR ME AS YOU CAN SO SAYING HE SPRANG OVER THE HEDGE AND DARTED OFF WITH A SPEED WHICH RENDERED IT MATTER OF EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY FOR THE OTHERS TO KEEP NEAR HIM GILES FOLLOWED AS WELL AS HE COULD AND OLIVER FOLLOWED TOO AND IN THE COURSE OF A MINUTE OR TWO MR LOSBERNE WHO HAD BEEN OUT WALKING AND JUST THEN RETURNED TUMBLED OVER THE HEDGE AFTER THEM AND PICKING HIMSELF UP WITH MORE AGILITY THAN HE COULD HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO POSSESS STRUCK INTO THE SAME COURSE AT NO CONTEMPTIBLE SPEED SHOUTING ALL THE WHILE MOST PRODIGIOUSLY TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER ON THEY ALL WENT NOR STOPPED THEY ONCE TO BREATHE UNTIL THE LEADER STRIKING OFF INTO AN ANGLE OF THE FIELD INDICATED BY OLIVER BEGAN TO SEARCH NARROWLY THE DITCH AND HEDGE ADJOINING WHICH AFFORDED TIME FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PARTY TO COME UP AND FOR OLIVER TO COMMUNICATE TO MR LOSBERNE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAD LED TO SO VIGOROUS A PURSUIT THE SEARCH WAS ALL IN VAIN THERE WERE NOT EVEN THE TRACES OF RECENT FOOTSTEPS TO BE SEEN THEY STOOD NOW ON THE SUMMIT OF A LITTLE HILL COMMANDING THE OPEN FIELDS IN EVERY DIRECTION FOR THREE OR FOUR MILES THERE WAS THE VILLAGE IN THE HOLLOW ON THE LEFT BUT IN ORDER TO GAIN THAT AFTER PURSUING THE TRACK OLIVER HAD POINTED OUT THE MEN MUST HAVE MADE A CIRCUIT OF OPEN GROUND WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THEY COULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN SO SHORT A TIME A THICK WOOD SKIRTED THE MEADOWLAND IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE GAINED THAT COVERT FOR THE SAME REASON IT MUST HAVE BEEN A DREAM OLIVER SAID HARRY MAYLIE OH NO INDEED SIR REPLIED OLIVER SHUDDERING AT THE VERY RECOLLECTION OF THE OLD WRETCHS COUNTENANCE I SAW HIM TOO PLAINLY FOR THAT I SAW THEM BOTH AS PLAINLY AS I SEE YOU NOW WHO WAS THE OTHER INQUIRED HARRY AND MR LOSBERNE TOGETHER THE VERY SAME MAN I TOLD YOU OF WHO CAME SO SUDDENLY UPON ME AT THE INN SAID OLIVER WE HAD OUR EYES FIXED FULL UPON EACH OTHER AND I COULD SWEAR TO HIM THEY TOOK THIS WAY DEMANDED HARRY ARE YOU SURE AS I AM THAT THE MEN WERE AT THE WINDOW REPLIED OLIVER POINTING DOWN AS HE SPOKE TO THE HEDGE WHICH DIVIDED THE COTTAGEGARDEN FROM THE MEADOW THE TALL MAN LEAPED OVER JUST THERE AND THE JEW RUNNING A FEW PACES TO THE RIGHT CREPT THROUGH THAT GAP THE TWO GENTLEMEN WATCHED OLIVERS EARNEST FACE AS HE SPOKE AND LOOKING FROM HIM TO EACH OTHER SEEMED TO FEEL SATISFIED OF THE ACCURACY OF WHAT HE SAID STILL IN NO DIRECTION WERE THERE ANY APPEARANCES OF THE TRAMPLING OF MEN IN HURRIED FLIGHT THE GRASS WAS LONG BUT IT WAS TRODDEN DOWN NOWHERE SAVE WHERE THEIR OWN FEET HAD CRUSHED IT THE SIDES AND BRINKS OF THE DITCHES WERE OF DAMP CLAY BUT IN NO ONE PLACE COULD THEY DISCERN THE PRINT OF MENS SHOES OR THE SLIGHTEST MARK WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT ANY FEET HAD PRESSED THE GROUND FOR HOURS BEFORE THIS IS STRANGE SAID HARRY STRANGE ECHOED THE DOCTOR BLATHERS AND DUFF THEMSELVES COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT NOTWITHSTANDING THE EVIDENTLY USELESS NATURE OF THEIR SEARCH THEY DID NOT DESIST UNTIL THE COMING ON OF NIGHT RENDERED ITS FURTHER PROSECUTION HOPELESS AND EVEN THEN THEY GAVE IT UP WITH RELUCTANCE GILES WAS DISPATCHED TO THE DIFFERENT ALEHOUSES IN THE VILLAGE FURNISHED WITH THE BEST DESCRIPTION OLIVER COULD GIVE OF THE APPEARANCE AND DRESS OF THE STRANGERS OF THESE THE JEW WAS AT ALL EVENTS SUFFICIENTLY REMARKABLE TO BE REMEMBERED SUPPOSING HE HAD BEEN SEEN DRINKING OR LOITERING ABOUT BUT GILES RETURNED WITHOUT ANY INTELLIGENCE CALCULATED TO DISPEL OR LESSEN THE MYSTERY ON THE NEXT DAY FRESH SEARCH WAS MADE AND THE INQUIRIES RENEWED BUT WITH NO BETTER SUCCESS ON THE DAY FOLLOWING OLIVER AND MR MAYLIE REPAIRED TO THE MARKETTOWN IN THE HOPE OF SEEING OR HEARING SOMETHING OF THE MEN THERE BUT THIS EFFORT WAS EQUALLY FRUITLESS AFTER A FEW DAYS THE AFFAIR BEGAN TO BE FORGOTTEN AS MOST AFFAIRS ARE WHEN WONDER HAVING NO FRESH FOOD TO SUPPORT IT DIES AWAY OF ITSELF MEANWHILE ROSE WAS RAPIDLY RECOVERING SHE HAD LEFT HER ROOM WAS ABLE TO GO OUT AND MIXING ONCE MORE WITH THE FAMILY CARRIED JOY INTO THE HEARTS OF ALL BUT ALTHOUGH THIS HAPPY CHANGE HAD A VISIBLE EFFECT ON THE LITTLE CIRCLE AND ALTHOUGH CHEERFUL VOICES AND MERRY LAUGHTER WERE ONCE MORE HEARD IN THE COTTAGE THERE WAS AT TIMES AN UNWONTED RESTRAINT UPON SOME THERE EVEN UPON ROSE HERSELF WHICH OLIVER COULD NOT FAIL TO REMARK MRS MAYLIE AND HER SON WERE OFTEN CLOSETED TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME AND MORE THAN ONCE ROSE APPEARED WITH TRACES OF TEARS UPON HER FACE AFTER MR LOSBERNE HAD FIXED A DAY FOR HIS DEPARTURE TO CHERTSEY THESE SYMPTOMS INCREASED AND IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING WAS IN PROGRESS WHICH AFFECTED THE PEACE OF THE YOUNG LADY AND OF SOMEBODY ELSE BESIDES AT LENGTH ONE MORNING WHEN ROSE WAS ALONE IN THE BREAKFASTPARLOUR HARRY MAYLIE ENTERED AND WITH SOME HESITATION BEGGED PERMISSION TO SPEAK WITH HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS A FEWA VERY FEWWILL SUFFICE ROSE SAID THE YOUNG MAN DRAWING HIS CHAIR TOWARDS HER WHAT I SHALL HAVE TO SAY HAS ALREADY PRESENTED ITSELF TO YOUR MIND THE MOST CHERISHED HOPES OF MY HEART ARE NOT UNKNOWN TO YOU THOUGH FROM MY LIPS YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THEM STATED ROSE HAD BEEN VERY PALE FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS ENTRANCE BUT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE EFFECT OF HER RECENT ILLNESS SHE MERELY BOWED AND BENDING OVER SOME PLANTS THAT STOOD NEAR WAITED IN SILENCE FOR HIM TO PROCEED IIOUGHT TO HAVE LEFT HERE BEFORE SAID HARRY YOU SHOULD INDEED REPLIED ROSE FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING SO BUT I WISH YOU HAD I WAS BROUGHT HERE BY THE MOST DREADFUL AND AGONISING OF ALL

BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD ARE VISITED WITH SICKNESS THEIR PURE SPIRITS INSENSIBLY TURN TOWARDS THEIR BRIGHT HOME OF LASTING REST WE KNOW HEAVEN HELP US THAT THE BEST AND FAIREST OF OUR KIND TOO OFTEN FADE IN BLOOMING THERE WERE TEARS IN THE EYES OF THE GENTLE GIRL AS THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN AND WHEN ONE FELL UPON THE FLOWER OVER WHICH SHE BENT AND GLISTENED BRIGHTLY IN ITS CUP MAKING IT MORE BEAUTIFUL IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE OUTPOURING OF HER FRESH YOUNG HEART CLAIMED KINDRED NATURALLY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS IN NATURE A CREATURE CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN PASSIONATELY A CREATURE AS FAIR AND INNOCENT OF GUILE AS ONE OF GODS OWN ANGELS FLUTTERED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH OH WHO COULD HOPE WHEN THE DISTANT WORLD TO WHICH SHE WAS AKIN HALF OPENED TO HER VIEW THAT SHE WOULD RETURN TO THE SORROW AND CALAMITY OF THIS ROSE ROSE TO KNOW THAT YOU WERE PASSING AWAY LIKE SOME SOFT SHADOW WHICH A LIGHT FROM ABOVE CASTS UPON THE EARTH TO HAVE NO HOPE THAT YOU WOULD BE SPARED TO THOSE WHO LINGER HERE

DEATH TO LIFE WITH EYES THAT TURNED BLIND WITH THEIR EAGERNESS AND DEEP AFFECTION DO NOT TELL ME THAT YOU WISH I HAD LOST THIS FOR IT HAS SOFTENED MY HEART TO ALL MANKIND I DID NOT MEAN THAT SAID ROSE

DOWN THE FRONT GLASS IN A GREAT HURRY AND SHOUTING TO THE POSTILLION SOMETHING VERY SHORT OF FLYING WILL KEEP PACE WITH ME DO YOU HEAR JINGLING AND CLATTERING TILL DISTANCE RENDERED ITS NOISE INAUDIBLE AND ITS RAPID PROGRESS ONLY PERCEPTIBLE TO THE EYE THE VEHICLE WOUND ITS WAY ALONG THE ROAD ALMOST HIDDEN IN A CLOUD OF DUST NOW WHOLLY DISAPPEARING AND NOW BECOMING VISIBLE AGAIN AS INTERVENING OBJECTS OR THE INTRICACIES OF THE WAY PERMITTED IT WAS NOT UNTIL EVEN THE DUSTY CLOUD WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN THAT THE GAZERS DISPERSED AND THERE WAS ONE LOOKERON WHO REMAINED WITH EYES FIXED UPON THE SPOT WHERE THE CARRIAGE HAD DISAPPEARED LONG AFTER IT WAS MANY MILES AWAY FOR BEHIND THE WHITE CURTAIN WHICH HAD SHROUDED HER FROM VIEW WHEN HARRY RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE WINDOW SAT ROSE HERSELF HE SEEMS IN HIGH SPIRITS AND HAPPY SHE SAID AT LENGTH I FEARED FOR A TIME HE MIGHT BE OTHERWISE I WAS MISTAKEN I AM VERY VERY GLAD TEARS ARE SIGNS OF GLADNESS AS WELL AS GRIEF BUT THOSE WHICH COURSED DOWN ROSES FACE AS SHE SAT PENSIVELY AT THE WINDOW STILL GAZING IN THE SAME DIRECTION SEEMED TO TELL MORE OF SORROW THAN OF JOY CHAPTER XXXVII IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES MR BUMBLE SAT IN THE WORKHOUSE PARLOUR WITH HIS EYES MOODILY FIXED ON THE CHEERLESS GRATE WHENCE AS IT WAS SUMMER TIME NO BRIGHTER GLEAM PROCEEDED THAN THE REFLECTION OF CERTAIN SICKLY RAYS OF THE SUN WHICH WERE SENT BACK FROM ITS COLD AND SHINING SURFACE A PAPER FLYCAGE DANGLED FROM THE CEILING TO WHICH HE OCCASIONALLY RAISED HIS EYES IN GLOOMY THOUGHT AND AS THE HEEDLESS INSECTS HOVERED ROUND THE GAUDY NETWORK MR BUMBLE WOULD HEAVE A DEEP SIGH WHILE A MORE GLOOMY SHADOW OVERSPREAD HIS COUNTENANCE MR BUMBLE WAS MEDITATING IT MIGHT BE THAT THE INSECTS BROUGHT TO MIND SOME PAINFUL PASSAGE IN HIS OWN PAST LIFE NOR WAS MR BUMBLES GLOOM THE ONLY THING CALCULATED TO AWAKEN A PLEASING MELANCHOLY IN THE BOSOM OF A SPECTATOR THERE WERE NOT WANTING OTHER APPEARANCES AND THOSE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH HIS OWN PERSON WHICH ANNOUNCED THAT A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE POSITION OF HIS AFFAIRS THE LACED COAT AND THE COCKED HAT WHERE WERE THEY HE STILL WORE KNEEBREECHES AND DARK COTTON STOCKINGS ON HIS NETHER LIMBS BUT THEY WERE NOT THE BREECHES THE COAT WAS WIDESKIRTED AND IN THAT RESPECT LIKE THE COAT BUT OH HOW DIFFERENT THE MIGHTY COCKED HAT WAS REPLACED BY A MODEST ROUND ONE MR BUMBLE WAS NO LONGER A BEADLE THERE ARE SOME PROMOTIONS IN LIFE WHICH INDEPENDENT OF THE MORE SUBSTANTIAL REWARDS THEY OFFER REQUIRE PECULIAR VALUE AND DIGNITY FROM THE COATS AND WAISTCOATS CONNECTED WITH THEM A FIELDMARSHAL HAS HIS UNIFORM A BISHOP HIS SILK APRON A COUNSELLOR HIS SILK GOWN A BEADLE HIS COCKED HAT STRIP THE BISHOP OF HIS APRON OR THE BEADLE OF HIS HAT AND LACE WHAT ARE THEY MEN MERE MEN DIGNITY AND EVEN HOLINESS TOO SOMETIMES ARE MORE QUESTIONS OF COAT AND WAISTCOAT THAN SOME PEOPLE IMAGINE MR BUMBLE HAD MARRIED MRS CORNEY AND WAS MASTER OF THE WORKHOUSE ANOTHER BEADLE HAD COME INTO POWER ON HIM THE COCKED HAT GOLDLACED COAT AND STAFF HAD ALL THREE DESCENDED AND TOMORROW TWO MONTHS IT WAS DONE SAID MR BUMBLE WITH A SIGH IT SEEMS A AGE MR BUMBLE MIGHT HAVE MEANT THAT HE HAD CONCENTRATED A WHOLE EXISTENCE OF HAPPINESS INTO THE SHORT SPACE OF EIGHT WEEKS BUT THE SIGHTHERE WAS A VAST DEAL OF MEANING IN THE SIGH I SOLD MYSELF SAID MR BUMBLE PURSUING THE SAME TRAIN OF RELECTION FOR SIX TEASPOONS A PAIR OF SUGARTONGS AND A MILKPOT WITH A SMALL QUANTITY OF SECONDHAND FURNITURE AND TWENTY POUND IN MONEY I WENT VERY REASONABLE CHEAP DIRT CHEAP CHEAP CRIED A SHRILL VOICE IN MR BUMBLES EAR YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAR AT ANY PRICE AND DEAR ENOUGH I PAID FOR YOU LORD ABOVE KNOWS THAT MR BUMBLE TURNED AND ENCOUNTERED THE FACE OF HIS INTERESTING CONSORT WHO IMPERFECTLY COMPREHENDING THE FEW WORDS SHE HAD OVERHEARD OF HIS COMPLAINT HAD HAZARDED THE FOREGOING REMARK AT A VENTURE MRS BUMBLE MAAM SAID MR BUMBLE WITH A SENTIMENTAL STERNNESS WELL CRIED THE LADY HAVE THE GOODNESS TO LOOK AT ME SAID MR BUMBLE FIXING HIS EYES UPON HER IF SHE STANDS SUCH A EYE AS THAT SAID MR BUMBLE TO HIMSELF SHE CAN STAND ANYTHING IT IS A EYE I NEVER KNEW TO FAIL WITH PAUPERS IF IT FAILS WITH HER MY POWER IS GONE WHETHER AN EXCEEDINGLY SMALL EXPANSION OF EYE BE SUFFICIENT TO QUELL PAUPERS WHO BEING LIGHTLY FED ARE IN NO VERY HIGH CONDITION OR WHETHER THE LATE MRS CORNEY WAS PARTICULARLY PROOF AGAINST EAGLE GLANCES ARE MATTERS OF OPINION THE MATTER OF FACT IS THAT THE MATRON WAS IN NO WAY OVERPOWERED BY MR BUMBLES SCOWL BUT ON THE CONTRARY TREATED IT WITH GREAT DISDAIN AND EVEN RAISED A LAUGH THEREAT WHICH SOUNDED AS THOUGH IT WERE GENUINE ON HEARING THIS MOST UNEXPECTED SOUND MR BUMBLE LOOKED FIRST INCREDULOUS AND AFTERWARDS AMAZED HE THEN RELAPSED INTO HIS FORMER STATE NOR DID HE ROUSE HIMSELF UNTIL HIS ATTENTION WAS AGAIN AWAKENED BY THE VOICE OF HIS PARTNER ARE YOU GOING TO SIT SNORING THERE ALL DAY INQUIRED MRS BUMBLE I AM GOING TO SIT HERE AS LONG AS I THINK PROPER MAAM REJOINED MR BUMBLE AND ALTHOUGH I WAS NOT SNORING I SHALL SNORE GAPE SNEEZE LAUGH OR CRY AS THE HUMOUR STRIKES ME SUCH BEING MY PREROGATIVE YOUR PREROGATIVE SNEERED MRS BUMBLE WITH INEFFABLE CONTEMPT I SAID THE WORD MAAM SAID MR BUMBLE THE PREROGATIVE OF A MAN IS TO COMMAND AND WHATS THE PREROGATIVE OF A WOMAN IN THE NAME OF GOODNESS CRIED THE RELICT OF MR CORNEY DECEASED TO OBEY MAAM THUNDERED MR BUMBLE YOUR LATE UNFORTUNATE HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE TAUGHT IT YOU AND THEN PERHAPS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALIVE NOW I WISH HE WAS POOR MAN MRS BUMBLE SEEING AT A GLANCE THAT THE DECISIVE MOMENT HAD NOW ARRIVED AND THAT A BLOW STRUCK FOR THE MASTERSHIP ON ONE SIDE OR OTHER MUST NECESSARILY BE FINAL AND CONCLUSIVE NO SOONER HEARD THIS ALLUSION TO THE DEAD AND GONE THAN SHE DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AND WITH A LOUD SCREAM THAT MR BUMBLE WAS A HARDHEARTED BRUTE FELL INTO A PAROXYSM OF TEARS BUT TEARS WERE NOT THE THINGS TO FIND THEIR WAY TO MR BUMBLES SOUL HIS HEART WAS WATERPROOF LIKE WASHABLE BEAVER HATS THAT IMPROVE WITH RAIN HIS NERVES WERE RENDERED STOUTER AND MORE VIGOROUS BY SHOWERS OF TEARS WHICH BEING TOKENS OF WEAKNESS AND SO FAR TACIT ADMISSIONS OF HIS OWN POWER PLEASED AND EXALTED HIM HE EYED HIS GOOD LADY WITH LOOKS OF GREAT SATISFACTION AND BEGGED IN AN ENCOURAGING MANNER THAT SHE SHOULD CRY HER HARDEST THE EXERCISE BEING LOOKED UPON BY THE FACULTY AS STRONGLY CONDUCIVE TO HEALTH IT OPENS THE LUNGS WASHES THE COUNTENANCE EXERCISES THE EYES AND SOFTENS DOWN THE TEMPER SAID MR BUMBLE SO CRY AWAY AS HE DISCHARGED HIMSELF OF THIS PLEASANTRY MR BUMBLE TOOK HIS HAT FROM A PEG AND PUTTING IT ON RATHER RAKISHLY ON ONE SIDE AS A MAN MIGHT WHO FELT HE HAD ASSERTED HIS SUPERIORITY IN A BECOMING MANNER THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS AND SAUNTERED TOWARDS THE DOOR WITH MUCH EASE AND WAGGISHNESS DEPICTED IN HIS WHOLE APPEARANCE NOW MRS CORNEY THAT WAS HAD TRIED THE TEARS BECAUSE THEY WERE LESS TROUBLESOME THAN A MANUAL ASSAULT BUT SHE WAS QUITE PREPARED TO MAKE TRIAL OF THE LATTER MODE OF PROCEEDING AS MR BUMBLE WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING THE FIRST PROOF HE EXPERIENCED OF THE FACT WAS CONVEYED IN A HOLLOW SOUND IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDED BY THE SUDDEN FLYING OFF OF HIS HAT TO THE OPPOSITE END OF THE ROOM THIS PRELIMINARY PROCEEDING LAYING BARE HIS HEAD THE EXPERT LADY CLASPING HIM TIGHTLY ROUND THE THROAT WITH ONE HAND INFLICTED A SHOWER OF BLOWS DEALT WITH SINGULAR VIGOUR AND DEXTERITY UPON IT WITH THE OTHER THIS DONE SHE CREATED A LITTLE VARIETY BY SCRATCHING HIS FACE AND TEARING HIS HAIR AND HAVING BY THIS TIME INFLICTED AS MUCH PUNISHMENT AS SHE DEEMED NECESSARY FOR THE OFFENCE SHE PUSHED HIM OVER A CHAIR WHICH WAS LUCKILY WELL SITUATED FOR THE PURPOSE AND DEFIED HIM TO TALK ABOUT HIS PREROGATIVE AGAIN IF HE DARED GET UP SAID MRS BUMBLE IN A VOICE OF COMMAND AND TAKE YOURSELF AWAY FROM HERE UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO DO SOMETHING DESPERATE MR BUMBLE ROSE WITH A VERY RUEFUL COUNTENANCE WONDERING MUCH WHAT SOMETHING DESPERATE MIGHT BE PICKING UP HIS HAT HE LOOKED TOWARDS THE DOOR ARE YOU GOING DEMANDED MRS BUMBLE CERTAINLY MY DEAR CERTAINLY REJOINED MR BUMBLE MAKING A QUICKER MOTION TOWARDS THE DOOR I DIDNT INTEND TOIM GOING MY DEAR YOU ARE SO VERY VIOLENT THAT REALLY I AT THIS INSTANT MRS BUMBLE STEPPED HASTILY FORWARD TO REPLACE THE CARPET WHICH HAD BEEN KICKED UP IN THE SCUFFLE MR BUMBLE IMMEDIATELY DARTED OUT OF THE ROOM WITHOUT BESTOWING ANOTHER THOUGHT ON HIS UNFINISHED SENTENCE LEAVING THE LATE MRS CORNEY IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE FIELD MR BUMBLE WAS FAIRLY TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND FAIRLY BEATEN HE HAD A DECIDED PROPENSITY FOR BULLYING DERIVED NO INCONSIDERABLE PLEASURE FROM THE EXERCISE OF PETTY CRUELTY AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY A COWARD THIS IS BY NO MEANS A DISPARAGEMENT TO HIS CHARACTER FOR MANY OFFICIAL PERSONAGES WHO ARE HELD IN HIGH RESPECT AND ADMIRATION ARE THE VICTIMS OF SIMILAR INFIRMITIES THE REMARK IS MADE INDEED RATHER IN HIS FAVOUR THAN OTHERWISE AND WITH A VIEW OF IMPRESSING THE READER WITH A JUST SENSE OF HIS QUALIFICATIONS FOR OFFICE BUT THE MEASURE OF HIS DEGRADATION WAS NOT YET FULL AFTER MAKING A TOUR OF THE HOUSE AND THINKING FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE POORLAWS REALLY WERE TOO HARD ON PEOPLE AND THAT MEN WHO RAN AWAY FROM THEIR WIVES LEAVING THEM CHARGEABLE TO THE PARISH OUGHT IN JUSTICE TO BE VISITED WITH NO PUNISHMENT AT ALL BUT RATHER REWARDED AS MERITORIOUS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD SUFFERED MUCH MR BUMBLE CAME TO A ROOM WHERE SOME OF THE FEMALE PAUPERS WERE USUALLY EMPLOYED IN WASHING THE

BROOKED NO DELAY CAUGHT UP A BOWL OF SOAPSUDS AND MOTIONING HIM TOWARDS THE DOOR ORDERED HIM INSTANTLY TO DEPART ON PAIN OF RECEIVING THE CONTENTS UPON HIS PORTLY PERSON WHAT COULD MR BUMBLE DO HE LOOKED DEJECTEDLY ROUND AND SLUNK AWAY AND AS HE REACHED THE DOOR THE TITTERINGS OF THE PAUPERS BROKE INTO A SHRILL CHUCKLE OF IRREPRESSIBLE DELIGHT IT WANTED BUT THIS HE WAS DEGRADED IN THEIR EYES HE HAD LOST CASTE AND STATION BEFORE THE VERY PAUPERS HE HAD FALLEN FROM ALL THE HEIGHT AND POMP OF BEADLESHIP TO THE LOWEST DEPTH OF THE MOST SNUBBED HENPECKERY ALL IN TWO MONTHS SAID MR BUMBLE FILLED WITH DISMAL THOUGHTS TWO MONTHS NO MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AGO I WAS NOT ONLY MY OWN MASTER BUT EVERYBODY ELSES SO FAR AS THE POROCHIAL WORKHOUSE WAS CONCERNED AND NOW IT WAS TOO MUCH MR BUMBLE BOXED THE EARS OF THE BOY WHO OPENED THE GATE FOR HIM FOR HE HAD REACHED THE PORTAL IN HIS REVERIE AND WALKED DISTRACTEDLY INTO THE STREET HE WALKED UP ONE STREET AND DOWN ANOTHER UNTIL EXERCISE HAD ABATED THE FIRST PASSION OF HIS GRIEF AND THEN THE REVULSION OF FEELING MADE HIM THIRSTY HE PASSED A GREAT MANY PUBLICHOUSES BUT AT LENGTH PAUSED BEFORE ONE IN A BYWAY WHOSE PARLOUR AS HE GATHERED FROM A HASTY

HAPPENED HOWEVER AS IT WILL HAPPEN VERY OFTEN WHEN MEN FALL INTO COMPANY UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MR BUMBLE FELT EVERY NOW AND THEN A POWERFUL INDUCEMENT WHICH HE COULD NOT RESIST TO STEAL A LOOK AT THE STRANGER AND THAT WHENEVER HE DID SO HE WITHDREW HIS EYES IN SOME CONFUSION TO FIND THAT THE STRANGER WAS AT THAT MOMENT STEALING A LOOK AT HIM MR BUMBLES AWKWARDNESS WAS ENHANCED BY THE VERY REMARKABLE EXPRESSION OF THE STRANGERS EYE WHICH WAS KEEN AND BRIGHT BUT SHADOWED BY A SCOWL OF DISTRUST AND SUSPICION UNLIKE ANYTHING HE HAD EVER OBSERVED BEFORE AND REPULSIVE TO BEHOLD WHEN THEY HAD ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHERS GLANCE SEVERAL TIMES IN THIS WAY THE STRANGER IN A HARSH DEEP VOICE BROKE SILENCE WERE YOU LOOKING FOR ME HE SAID WHEN YOU PEERED IN AT THE WINDOW NOT THAT I AM AWARE OF UNLESS

INTELLIGENCE BUT AT LENGTH HE BREATHED MORE FREELY AND WITHDRAWING HIS EYES OBSERVED THAT IT WAS NO GREAT MATTER WITH THAT HE ROSE AS IF TO DEPART BUT MR BUMBLE WAS CUNNING ENOUGH AND HE AT ONCE SAW THAT AN OPPORTUNITY WAS OPENED FOR THE LUCRATIVE DISPOSAL OF SOME SECRET IN THE POSSESSION OF HIS BETTER HALF HE WELL REMEMBERED THE NIGHT OF OLD SALLYS DEATH WHICH THE OCCURRENCES OF THAT DAY HAD GIVEN HIM GOOD REASON TO RECOLLECT AS THE OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAD PROPOSED TO MRS CORNEY AND ALTHOUGH THAT LADY HAD NEVER CONFIDED TO HIM THE DISCLOSURE OF WHICH SHE HAD BEEN THE SOLITARY WITNESS HE HAD HEARD ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT IT RELATED TO SOMETHING THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE OLD WOMANS ATTENDANCE AS WORKHOUSE NURSE UPON THE YOUNG MOTHER OF OLIVER TWIST HASTILY CALLING THIS CIRCUMSTANCE TO MIND

BEEN THREATENING ALL DAY SPREAD OUT IN A DENSE AND SLUGGISH MASS OF VAPOUR ALREADY YIELDED LARGE DROPS OF RAIN AND SEEMED TO PRESAGE A VIOLENT THUNDERSTORM WHEN MR AND MRS BUMBLE TURNING OUT OF THE MAIN STREET OF THE TOWN DIRECTED THEIR COURSE TOWARDS A SCATTERED LITTLE COLONY OF RUINOUS HOUSES DISTANT FROM IT SOME MILE AND AHALF OR THEREABOUTS AND ERECTED ON A LOW UNWHOLESOME SWAMP BORDERING UPON THE RIVER THEY WERE BOTH WRAPPED IN OLD AND SHABBY OUTER GARMENTS WHICH MIGHT PERHAPS SERVE THE DOUBLE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THEIR PERSONS FROM THE RAIN AND SHELTERING THEM FROM OBSERVATION THE HUSBAND CARRIED A LANTERN FROM WHICH HOWEVER NO LIGHT YET SHONE AND TRUDGED ON A FEW PACES IN FRONT AS THOUGHTHE WAY BEING DIRTYTO GIVE HIS WIFE THE BENEFIT OF TREADING IN HIS HEAVY FOOTPRINTS THEY WENT ON IN PROFOUND SILENCE EVERY NOW AND THEN MR BUMBLE RELAXED HIS PACE AND TURNED HIS HEAD AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS HELPMATE WAS FOLLOWING THEN DISCOVERING THAT SHE WAS CLOSE AT HIS HEELS HE MENDED HIS RATE OF WALKING AND PROCEEDED AT A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE OF SPEED TOWARDS THEIR PLACE OF DESTINATION THIS WAS FAR FROM BEING A PLACE OF DOUBTFUL CHARACTER FOR IT HAD LONG BEEN KNOWN AS THE RESIDENCE OF NONE BUT LOW RUFFIANS WHO UNDER VARIOUS PRETENCES OF LIVING BY THEIR LABOUR SUBSISTED CHIEFLY ON PLUNDER AND CRIME IT WAS A COLLECTION OF MERE HOVELS SOME HASTILY BUILT WITH LOOSE BRICKS

AND MADE FAST TO THE DWARF WALL WHICH SKIRTED IT AND HERE AND THERE AN OAR OR COIL OF ROPE APPEARED AT FIRST TO INDICATE THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THESE MISERABLE COTTAGES PURSUED SOME AVOCATION ON THE RIVER BUT A GLANCE AT THE SHATTERED AND USELESS CONDITION OF THE ARTICLES THUS DISPLAYED WOULD HAVE LED A PASSERBY WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY TO THE CONJECTURE THAT THEY WERE DISPOSED THERE RATHER FOR THE PRESERVATION OF APPEARANCES THAN WITH ANY VIEW TO THEIR BEING ACTUALLY EMPLOYED IN THE HEART OF THIS CLUSTER OF HUTS AND SKIRTING THE RIVER WHICH ITS UPPER STORIES OVERHUNG STOOD A LARGE BUILDING FORMERLY USED AS A MANUFACTORY OF SOME KIND IT HAD IN ITS DAY PROBABLY FURNISHED EMPLOYMENT TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE SURROUNDING TENEMENTS BUT IT HAD LONG SINCE GONE TO RUIN THE RAT THE WORM AND THE ACTION OF THE DAMP HAD WEAKENED AND ROTTED THE PILES ON WHICH IT STOOD AND A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE BUILDING HAD ALREADY SUNK DOWN INTO THE WATER WHILE THE REMAINDER TOTTERING AND BENDING OVER THE DARK STREAM SEEMED TO WAIT A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY OF FOLLOWING ITS OLD COMPANION AND INVOLVING ITSELF IN THE SAME FATE IT WAS BEFORE THIS RUINOUS BUILDING THAT THE WORTHY COUPLE PAUSED AS THE

APPEARED IN NO WAY INTERESTED IN THE ARRIVAL OR TO CARE WHETHER THE PERSON WHOEVER HE WAS CAME OR WENT UNTIL THE MURMUR OF A MANS VOICE REACHED HER EARS THE INSTANT SHE CAUGHT THE SOUND SHE TORE OFF HER BONNET AND SHAWL WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AND THRUST THEM UNDER THE TABLE THE JEW TURNING ROUND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS SHE MUTTERED A COMPLAINT OF THE HEAT IN A TONE OF LANGUOR THAT CONTRASTED VERY REMARKABLY WITH THE EXTREME HASTE AND VIOLENCE OF THIS ACTION WHICH HOWEVER HAD BEEN UNOBSERVED BY FAGIN WHO HAD HIS BACK TOWARDS HER AT THE TIME BAH HE WHISPERED AS THOUGH NETTLED BY THE INTERRUPTION ITS THE MAN I EXPECTED BEFORE HES COMING DOWNSTAIRS NOT A WORD ABOUT THE MONEY WHILE HES HERE NANCE HE WONT STOP LONG NOT TEN MINUTES MY DEAR LAYING HIS SKINNY FOREFINGER UPON HIS LIP THE JEW CARRIED A CANDLE TO THE DOOR AS A MANS STEP WAS HEARD UPON THE STAIRS WITHOUT HE REACHED IT AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE VISITOR WHO COMING HASTILY INTO THE ROOM WAS CLOSE UPON THE GIRL BEFORE HE OBSERVED HER IT WAS MONKS ONLY ONE OF MY YOUNG PEOPLE SAID FAGIN OBSERVING THAT MONKS DREW BACK ON BEHOLDING A STRANGER DONT MOVE NANCY THE GIRL DREW CLOSER TO THE TABLE AND GLANCING AT MONKS WITH AN AIR OF CARELESS LEVITY WITHDREW HER EYES BUT AS HE TURNED TOWARDS FAGIN SHE STOLE ANOTHER LOOK SO KEEN AND SEARCHING AND FULL OF PURPOSE THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY BYSTANDER TO OBSERVE THE CHANGE HE COULD HARDLY HAVE BELIEVED THE TWO LOOKS TO HAVE PROCEEDED FROM THE SAME PERSON ANY NEWS INQUIRED FAGIN GREAT ANDANDGOOD ASKED FAGIN HESITATING AS THOUGH HE FEARED TO VEX THE OTHER MAN BY BEING TOO SANGUINE NOT BAD ANY WAY REPLIED MONKS WITH A SMILE I HAVE BEEN PROMPT ENOUGH THIS TIME LET ME HAVE A WORD WITH YOU THE GIRL DREW CLOSER TO THE TABLE AND MADE NO OFFER TO LEAVE THE ROOM ALTHOUGH SHE COULD SEE THAT MONKS WAS POINTING TO HER THE JEW PERHAPS FEARING SHE MIGHT SAY SOMETHING ALOUD ABOUT THE MONEY IF HE ENDEAVOURED TO GET RID OF HER POINTED UPWARD AND TOOK MONKS OUT OF THE ROOM NOT THAT INFERNAL HOLE WE WERE IN BEFORE SHE COULD HEAR THE MAN SAY AS THEY WENT UPSTAIRS FAGIN LAUGHED AND MAKING SOME REPLY WHICH DID NOT REACH HER SEEMED BY THE CREAKING OF THE BOARDS TO LEAD HIS COMPANION TO THE SECOND STORY BEFORE THE SOUND OF THEIR FOOTSTEPS HAD CEASED TO ECHO THROUGH THE HOUSE THE GIRL HAD SLIPPED OFF HER SHOES AND DRAWING HER GOWN LOOSELY OVER HER HEAD AND MUFFLING HER ARMS IN IT STOOD AT THE DOOR LISTENING WITH BREATHLESS INTEREST THE MOMENT THE NOISE CEASED SHE GLIDED FROM THE ROOM ASCENDED THE STAIRS WITH INCREDIBLE SOFTNESS AND SILENCE AND WAS LOST IN THE GLOOM ABOVE THE ROOM REMAINED DESERTED FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR MORE THE GIRL GLIDED BACK WITH THE SAME UNEARTHLY TREAD AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS THE TWO MEN WERE HEARD DESCENDING MONKS WENT AT ONCE INTO THE STREET AND THE JEW CRAWLED UPSTAIRS AGAIN FOR THE MONEY WHEN HE RETURNED THE GIRL WAS ADJUSTING HER SHAWL AND BONNET AS IF PREPARING TO BE GONE WHY NANCE EXCLAIMED THE JEW STARTING BACK AS HE PUT DOWN THE CANDLE HOW PALE YOU ARE PALE ECHOED THE GIRL SHADING HER EYES WITH HER HANDS AS IF TO LOOK STEADILY AT HIM QUITE HORRIBLE WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING TO YOURSELF NOTHING THAT I KNOW OF EXCEPT SITTING IN THIS CLOSE PLACE FOR I DONT KNOW HOW LONG AND ALL REPLIED THE GIRL CARELESSLY COME LET ME GET BACK THATS A DEAR WITH A SIGH FOR EVERY PIECE OF MONEY FAGIN TOLD THE AMOUNT INTO HER HAND THEY PARTED WITHOUT MORE CONVERSATION MERELY INTERCHANGING A GOODNIGHT WHEN THE GIRL GOT INTO THE OPEN STREET SHE SAT DOWN UPON A DOORSTEP AND SEEMED FOR A FEW MOMENTS WHOLLY BEWILDERED AND UNABLE TO PURSUE HER WAY SUDDENLY SHE AROSE AND HURRYING ON IN A DIRECTION QUITE OPPOSITE TO THAT IN WHICH SIKES WAS AWAITING HER RETURNED QUICKENED HER PACE UNTIL IT GRADUALLY RESOLVED INTO A VIOLENT RUN AFTER COMPLETELY EXHAUSTING HERSELF SHE STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH AND AS IF SUDDENLY RECOLLECTING HERSELF AND DEPLORING HER INABILITY TO DO SOMETHING SHE WAS BENT UPON WRUNG HER HANDS AND BURST INTO TEARS IT MIGHT BE THAT HER TEARS RELIEVED HER OR THAT SHE FELT THE FULL HOPELESSNESS OF HER CONDITION BUT SHE TURNED BACK AND HURRYING WITH NEARLY AS GREAT RAPIDITY IN THE CONTRARY DIRECTION PARTLY TO RECOVER LOST TIME AND PARTLY TO KEEP PACE WITH THE VIOLENT CURRENT OF HER OWN THOUGHTS SOON REACHED THE DWELLING WHERE SHE HAD LEFT THE HOUSEBREAKER IF SHE BETRAYED ANY AGITATION WHEN SHE PRESENTED HERSELF TO MR SIKES HE DID NOT OBSERVE IT FOR MERELY INQUIRING IF SHE HAD BROUGHT THE MONEY AND RECEIVING A REPLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE HE UTTERED A GROWL OF SATISFACTION AND REPLACING HIS HEAD UPON THE PILLOW RESUMED THE SLUMBERS WHICH HER ARRIVAL HAD INTERRUPTED IT WAS FORTUNATE FOR HER THAT THE POSSESSION OF MONEY OCCASIONED HIM SO MUCH EMPLOYMENT NEXT DAY IN THE WAY OF EATING AND DRINKING AND WITHAL HAD SO BENEFICIAL AN EFFECT IN SMOOTHING DOWN THE ASPERITIES OF HIS TEMPER THAT HE HAD NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO BE VERY CRITICAL UPON HER BEHAVIOUR AND DEPORTMENT THAT SHE HAD ALL THE ABSTRACTED AND NERVOUS MANNER OF ONE WHO IS ON THE EVE OF SOME BOLD AND HAZARDOUS STEP WHICH IT HAS REQUIRED NO COMMON STRUGGLE TO RESOLVE UPON WOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO THE LYNXEYED FAGIN WHO WOULD MOST PROBABLY HAVE TAKEN THE ALARM AT ONCE BUT MR SIKES LACKING THE NICETIES OF DISCRIMINATION AND BEING TROUBLED WITH NO MORE SUBTLE MISGIVINGS THAN THOSE WHICH RESOLVE THEMSELVES INTO A DOGGED ROUGHNESS OF BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS EVERYBODY AND BEING FURTHERMORE IN AN UNUSUALLY AMIABLE CONDITION AS HAS BEEN ALREADY OBSERVED SAW NOTHING UNUSUAL IN HER DEMEANOR AND INDEED TROUBLED HIMSELF SO LITTLE ABOUT HER THAT HAD HER AGITATION BEEN FAR MORE PERCEPTIBLE THAN IT WAS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNLIKELY TO HAVE AWAKENED HIS SUSPICIONS AS THAT DAY CLOSED IN THE GIRLS EXCITEMENT INCREASED AND WHEN NIGHT CAME ON AND SHE SAT BY WATCHING UNTIL THE HOUSEBREAKER SHOULD DRINK HIMSELF ASLEEP THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL PALENESS IN HER CHEEK AND A FIRE IN HER EYE THAT EVEN SIKES OBSERVED WITH ASTONISHMENT MR SIKES BEING WEAK FROM THE FEVER WAS LYING IN BED TAKING HOT WATER WITH HIS GIN TO RENDER IT LESS INFLAMMATORY AND HAD PUSHED HIS GLASS TOWARDS NANCY TO BE REPLENISHED FOR THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME WHEN THESE SYMPTOMS FIRST STRUCK HIM WHY BURN MY BODY SAID THE MAN RAISING HIMSELF ON HIS HANDS AS HE STARED THE GIRL IN THE FACE YOU LOOK LIKE A CORPSE COME TO LIFE AGAIN WHATS THE MATTER MATTER REPLIED THE GIRL NOTHING WHAT DO YOU LOOK AT ME SO HARD FOR WHAT FOOLERY IS THIS DEMANDED SIKES GRASPING HER BY THE ARM AND SHAKING HER ROUGHLY WHAT IS IT WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF OF MANY THINGS BILL REPLIED THE GIRL SHIVERING AND AS SHE DID SO PRESSING HER HANDS UPON HER EYES BUT LORD WHAT ODDS IN THAT THE TONE OF FORCED GAIETY IN WHICH THE LAST WORDS WERE SPOKEN SEEMED TO PRODUCE A DEEPER IMPRESSION ON SIKES THAN THE WILD AND RIGID LOOK WHICH HAD PRECEDED THEM I TELL YOU WOT IT IS SAID SIKES IF YOU HAVENT CAUGHT THE FEVER AND GOT IT COMIN ON NOW THERES SOMETHING MORE THAN USUAL IN THE WIND AND SOMETHING DANGEROUS TOO YOURE NOT AGOING TO NO DAMME YOU WOULDNT DO THAT DO WHAT ASKED THE GIRL THERE AINT SAID SIKES FIXING HIS EYES UPON HER AND MUTTERING THE WORDS TO HIMSELF THERE AINT A STAUNCHERHEARTED GAL GOING OR ID HAVE CUT HER THROAT THREE MONTHS AGO SHES GOT THE FEVER COMING ON THATS IT FORTIFYING HIMSELF WITH THIS ASSURANCE SIKES DRAINED THE GLASS TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN WITH MANY GRUMBLING OATHS CALLED FOR HIS PHYSIC THE GIRL JUMPED UP WITH GREAT ALACRITY POURED IT QUICKLY OUT BUT WITH HER BACK TOWARDS HIM AND HELD THE VESSEL TO HIS LIPS WHILE HE DRANK OFF THE CONTENTS NOW SAID THE ROBBER COME AND SIT ASIDE OF ME AND PUT ON YOUR OWN FACE OR ILL ALTER IT SO THAT YOU WONT KNOW IT AGIN WHEN YOU DO WANT IT THE GIRL OBEYED SIKES LOCKING HER HAND IN HIS FELL BACK UPON THE PILLOW TURNING HIS EYES UPON HER FACE THEY CLOSED OPENED AGAIN CLOSED ONCE MORE AGAIN OPENED HE SHIFTED HIS POSITION RESTLESSLY AND AFTER DOZING AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND AS OFTEN SPRINGING UP WITH A LOOK OF TERROR AND GAZING VACANTLY ABOUT HIM WAS SUDDENLY STRICKEN AS IT WERE WHILE IN THE VERY ATTITUDE OF RISING INTO A DEEP AND HEAVY SLEEP THE GRASP OF HIS HAND RELAXED THE UPRAISED ARM FELL LANGUIDLY BY HIS SIDE AND HE LAY LIKE ONE IN A PROFOUND TRANCE THE LAUDANUM HAS TAKEN EFFECT AT LAST MURMURED THE GIRL AS SHE ROSE FROM THE BEDSIDE I MAY BE TOO LATE EVEN NOW SHE HASTILY DRESSED HERSELF IN HER BONNET AND SHAWL LOOKING FEARFULLY ROUND FROM TIME TO TIME AS IF DESPITE THE SLEEPING DRAUGHT SHE EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT TO FEEL THE PRESSURE OF SIKESS HEAVY HAND UPON HER SHOULDER THEN STOOPING SOFTLY OVER THE BED SHE KISSED THE ROBBERS LIPS AND THEN OPENING AND CLOSING THE ROOMDOOR WITH NOISELESS TOUCH HURRIED FROM THE HOUSE A WATCHMAN WAS CRYING HALFPAST NINE DOWN A DARK PASSAGE THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD TO PASS IN GAINING THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE HAS IT LONG GONE THE HALFHOUR ASKED THE GIRL ITLL STRIKE THE HOUR IN ANOTHER QUARTER SAID THE MAN RAISING HIS LANTERN TO HER FACE AND I CANNOT GET THERE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR OR MORE MUTTERED NANCY BRUSHING SWIFTLY PAST HIM AND GLIDING RAPIDLY DOWN THE STREET MANY OF THE SHOPS WERE ALREADY CLOSING IN THE BACK LANES AND AVENUES THROUGH WHICH SHE TRACKED HER WAY IN MAKING FROM SPITALFIELDS TOWARDS THE WESTEND OF LONDON THE CLOCK STRUCK TEN INCREASING HER IMPATIENCE SHE TORE ALONG THE NARROW PAVEMENT ELBOWING THE PASSENGERS FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND DARTING ALMOST UNDER THE HORSES HEADS CROSSED CROWDED STREETS WHERE CLUSTERS OF PERSONS WERE EAGERLY WATCHING THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE LIKE THE WOMAN IS MAD SAID THE PEOPLE TURNING TO LOOK AFTER HER AS SHE RUSHED AWAY WHEN SHE REACHED THE MORE WEALTHY QUARTER OF THE TOWN THE STREETS WERE COMPARATIVELY DESERTED AND HERE HER HEADLONG PROGRESS EXCITED A STILL GREATER CURIOSITY IN THE STRAGGLERS WHOM SHE HURRIED PAST SOME QUICKENED THEIR PACE BEHIND AS THOUGH TO SEE WHITHER SHE WAS HASTENING AT SUCH AN UNUSUAL RATE AND A FEW MADE HEAD UPON HER AND LOOKED BACK SURPRISED AT HER UNDIMINISHED SPEED BUT THEY FELL OFF ONE BY ONE AND WHEN SHE NEARED HER PLACE OF DESTINATION SHE WAS ALONE IT WAS A FAMILY HOTEL IN A QUIET BUT HANDSOME STREET NEAR HYDE PARK AS THE BRILLIANT LIGHT OF THE LAMP WHICH BURNT BEFORE ITS DOOR GUIDED HER TO THE SPOT THE CLOCK STRUCK ELEVEN SHE HAD LOITERED FOR A FEW PACES AS THOUGH IRRESOLUTE AND MAKING UP HER MIND TO ADVANCE BUT THE SOUND DETERMINED HER AND SHE STEPPED INTO THE HALL THE PORTERS SEAT WAS VACANT SHE LOOKED ROUND WITH AN AIR OF INCERTITUDE AND ADVANCED TOWARDS THE STAIRS NOW YOUNG WOMAN SAID A

KENNEL DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH ME SAID THE GIRL TURNING TO THE MEN AGAIN BUT DO WHAT I ASK YOU FIRST AND I ASK YOU TO GIVE THIS MESSAGE FOR GOD ALMIGHTYS SAKE THE SOFTHEARTED COOK ADDED HIS INTERCESSION

ANTECHAMBER LIGHTED BY A LAMP FROM THE CEILING HERE HE LEFT HER AND RETIRED CHAPTER XL A STRANGE INTERVIEW WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER THE GIRLS LIFE HAD BEEN SQUANDERED IN THE STREETS AND AMONG THE MOST NOISOME OF THE STEWS AND DENS OF LONDON BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THE WOMANS ORIGINAL NATURE LEFT IN HER STILL AND WHEN SHE HEARD A LIGHT STEP APPROACHING THE DOOR OPPOSITE TO THAT BY WHICH SHE HAD ENTERED AND THOUGHT OF THE WIDE CONTRAST WHICH THE SMALL ROOM WOULD IN ANOTHER MOMENT CONTAIN SHE FELT BURDENED WITH THE SENSE OF HER OWN DEEP SHAME AND SHRUNK AS THOUGH SHE COULD

SITUATION WAS INDEED ONE OF NO COMMON TRIAL AND DIFFICULTY WHILE SHE FELT THE MOST EAGER AND BURNING DESIRE TO PENETRATE THE MYSTERY IN WHICH OLIVERS HISTORY WAS ENVELOPED SHE COULD NOT BUT HOLD SACRED THE CONFIDENCE WHICH THE MISERABLE WOMAN WITH WHOM SHE HAD JUST CONVERSED HAD REPOSED IN HER AS A YOUNG AND GUILELESS GIRL HER WORDS AND MANNER HAD TOUCHED ROSE MAYLIES HEART AND MINGLED WITH HER LOVE FOR HER YOUNG CHARGE AND SCARCELY LESS INTENSE IN ITS TRUTH AND FERVOUR WAS HER FOND WISH TO WIN THE OUTCAST BACK TO REPENTANCE AND HOPE THEY PURPOSED REMAINING IN LONDON ONLY THREE DAYS

HOW COULD SHE POSTPONE THE JOURNEY WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION MR LOSBERNE WAS WITH THEM AND WOULD BE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS BUT ROSE WAS TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXCELLENT GENTLEMANS IMPETUOSITY AND FORESAW TOO CLEARLY THE WRATH WITH WHICH IN THE FIRST EXPLOSION OF HIS INDIGNATION HE WOULD REGARD THE INSTRUMENT OF OLIVERS RECAPTURE TO TRUST HIM WITH THE SECRET WHEN HER REPRESENTATIONS IN THE GIRLS BEHALF COULD BE SECONDED BY NO EXPERIENCED PERSON THESE WERE ALL REASONS FOR THE GREATEST CAUTION AND MOST CIRCUMSPECT BEHAVIOUR IN COMMUNICATING IT TO MRS MAYLIE WHOSE FIRST IMPULSE WOULD INFALLIBLY BE TO HOLD A CONFERENCE WITH THE WORTHY DOCTOR ON THE SUBJECT AS TO RESORTING TO ANY LEGAL ADVISER EVEN IF SHE HAD KNOWN HOW TO DO SO IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE THOUGHT OF FOR THE SAME REASON ONCE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HER OF SEEKING ASSISTANCE FROM HARRY BUT THIS AWAKENED THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR LAST PARTING AND IT SEEMED UNWORTHY OF HER TO CALL HIM BACK WHENTHE TEARS ROSE TO HER EYES AS SHE PURSUED THIS TRAIN OF REFLECTIONHE MIGHT HAVE BY THIS TIME LEARNT TO FORGET HER AND TO BE HAPPIER AWAY DISTURBED BY THESE DIFFERENT REFLECTIONS INCLINING NOW TO ONE COURSE AND THEN TO ANOTHER

STUDIOUSLY ABSTAIN FROM MEETING MEHE DID WHEN HE WENT AWAY I HARDLY THOUGHT HE WOULD BUT IT WAS BETTER FOR US BOTH AND HERE ROSE DROPPED THE PEN AND TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH THE VERY PAPER WHICH WAS TO BE HER MESSENGER SHOULD NOT SEE HER WEEP SHE HAD TAKEN UP THE SAME PEN AND LAID IT DOWN AGAIN FIFTY TIMES AND HAD CONSIDERED AND RECONSIDERED THE FIRST LINE OF HER LETTER WITHOUT WRITING THE FIRST WORD WHEN OLIVER WHO HAD BEEN WALKING IN THE STREETS WITH MR GILES FOR A BODYGUARD ENTERED THE ROOM IN SUCH BREATHLESS HASTE AND VIOLENT AGITATION AS SEEMED TO BETOKEN SOME NEW CAUSE OF ALARM WHAT

HOUR AND BE READY AS SOON AS YOU ARE OLIVER NEEDED NO PROMPTING TO DESPATCH AND IN LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CRAVEN STREET WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE ROSE LEFT OLIVER IN THE COACH UNDER PRETENCE OF PREPARING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO RECEIVE HIM AND SENDING UP HER CARD BY THE SERVANT REQUESTED TO SEE MR BROWNLOW ON VERY PRESSING BUSINESS THE SERVANT SOON RETURNED TO BEG THAT SHE WOULD WALK UPSTAIRS AND FOLLOWING HIM INTO AN UPPER ROOM MISS MAYLIE WAS PRESENTED TO AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN OF BENEVOLENT APPEARANCE IN A BOTTLEGREEN COAT AT NO GREAT DISTANCE FROM WHOM WAS SEATED ANOTHER OLD GENTLEMAN IN NANKEEN BREECHES AND GAITERS WHO DID NOT LOOK PARTICULARLY BENEVOLENT AND WHO WAS SITTING WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED ON THE TOP OF A THICK STICK AND HIS CHIN PROPPED THEREUPON

WHICH I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU MR BROWNLOW INCLINED HIS HEAD MR GRIMWIG WHO HAD MADE ONE VERY STIFF BOW AND RISEN FROM HIS CHAIR MADE ANOTHER VERY STIFF BOW AND DROPPED INTO IT AGAIN I SHALL SURPRISE YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID ROSE NATURALLY EMBARRASSED BUT YOU ONCE SHOWED GREAT BENEVOLENCE AND GOODNESS TO A VERY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND OF MINE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL TAKE AN INTEREST IN HEARING OF HIM AGAIN INDEED SAID MR BROWNLOW OLIVER TWIST YOU KNEW HIM AS REPLIED ROSE THE WORDS NO SOONER ESCAPED HER LIPS THAN MR GRIMWIG WHO HAD BEEN AFFECTING TO DIP INTO A LARGE BOOK THAT LAY ON THE TABLE UPSET IT WITH A GREAT CRASH AND FALLING BACK IN HIS CHAIR DISCHARGED FROM HIS FEATURES EVERY EXPRESSION BUT ONE OF UNMITIGATED WONDER AND INDULGED IN A PROLONGED AND VACANT STARE THEN AS IF ASHAMED OF HAVING BETRAYED SO MUCH EMOTION HE JERKED HIMSELF AS IT WERE BY A CONVULSION INTO HIS FORMER ATTITUDE AND LOOKING OUT STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM EMITTED A LONG DEEP WHISTLE WHICH SEEMED AT LAST NOT TO BE DISCHARGED ON EMPTY AIR BUT TO DIE AWAY IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF HIS STOMACH MR BROWLOW WAS NO LESS SURPRISED ALTHOUGH HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT EXPRESSED IN THE SAME ECCENTRIC MANNER HE DREW HIS CHAIR NEARER TO MISS MAYLIES AND SAID DO ME THE FAVOUR MY DEAR YOUNG LADY TO LEAVE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT GOODNESS AND BENEVOLENCE OF WHICH YOU SPEAK AND OF WHICH NOBODY ELSE KNOWS ANYTHING AND IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO PRODUCE ANY EVIDENCE WHICH WILL ALTER THE UNFAVOURABLE OPINION I WAS ONCE INDUCED TO ENTERTAIN OF THAT POOR CHILD IN HEAVENS NAME PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF IT A BAD ONE ILL EAT MY HEAD IF HE IS NOT A BAD ONE GROWLED MR GRIMWIG SPEAKING BY SOME VENTRILOQUIAL POWER WITHOUT MOVING A MUSCLE OF HIS FACE HE IS A CHILD OF A NOBLE NATURE AND A WARM HEART SAID ROSE COLOURING AND THAT POWER WHICH HAS THOUGHT FIT TO TRY HIM BEYOND HIS YEARS HAS PLANTED IN HIS BREAST AFFECTIONS AND FEELINGS WHICH WOULD DO HONOUR TO MANY WHO HAVE NUMBERED HIS DAYS SIX TIMES OVER IM ONLY SIXTYONE SAID MR GRIMWIG WITH THE SAME RIGID FACE AND AS THE DEVILS IN IT IF THIS OLIVER IS NOT TWELVE YEARS OLD AT LEAST I DONT SEE THE APPLICATION OF THAT REMARK DO NOT HEED MY FRIEND

THUS FAR THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN SEVERALLY TOOK SNUFF AND AFTERWARDS SHOOK HANDS ACCORDING TO THEIR INVARIABLE CUSTOM NOW MISS MAYLIE SAID MR BROWNLOW TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT IN WHICH YOUR HUMANITY IS SO MUCH INTERESTED WILL YOU LET ME KNOW WHAT INTELLIGENCE YOU HAVE OF THIS POOR CHILD ALLOWING ME TO PROMISE THAT I EXHAUSTED EVERY MEANS IN MY POWER OF DISCOVERING HIM AND THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN ABSENT FROM THIS COUNTRY MY FIRST IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD IMPOSED UPON ME AND HAD BEEN PERSUADED BY HIS FORMER ASSOCIATES TO ROB ME HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLY SHAKEN ROSE WHO HAD HAD TIME TO COLLECT HER THOUGHTS AT ONCE RELATED IN A FEW NATURAL WORDS ALL THAT HAD BEFALLEN OLIVER SINCE HE LEFT MR BROWNLOWS HOUSE RESERVING NANCYS INFORMATION FOR THAT GENTLEMANS PRIVATE EAR AND CONCLUDING WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HIS ONLY SORROW FOR SOME MONTHS PAST HAD BEEN NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET WITH HIS FORMER BENEFACTOR AND FRIEND THANK GOD SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN THIS IS GREAT HAPPINESS TO ME GREAT HAPPINESS BUT YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHERE HE IS NOW MISS MAYLIE YOU MUST PARDON MY FINDING FAULT WITH YOUBUT WHY NOT HAVE BROUGHT HIM HE IS WAITING IN A COACH AT THE DOOR REPLIED ROSE AT THIS DOOR CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH WHICH HE HURRIED OUT OF THE ROOM DOWN THE STAIRS UP THE COACHSTEPS AND INTO THE COACH WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD WHEN THE ROOMDOOR CLOSED BEHIND HIM MR GRIMWIG LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND CONVERTING ONE OF THE HIND LEGS OF HIS CHAIR INTO A PIVOT DESCRIBED THREE DISTINCT CIRCLES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS STICK AND THE TABLE SITTING IN IT ALL THE TIME AFTER PERFORMING THIS EVOLUTION HE ROSE AND LIMPED AS FAST AS HE COULD UP AND DOWN THE ROOM AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES AND THEN STOPPING SUDDENLY BEFORE ROSE KISSED HER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST PREFACE HUSH HE SAID AS THE YOUNG LADY ROSE IN SOME ALARM AT THIS UNUSUAL PROCEEDING DONT BE AFRAID IM OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR GRANDFATHER YOURE A SWEET GIRL I LIKE YOU HERE THEY ARE IN FACT AS HE THREW HIMSELF AT ONE DEXTEROUS DIVE INTO HIS FORMER SEAT MR BROWNLOW RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY OLIVER WHOM MR GRIMWIG RECEIVED VERY GRACIOUSLY AND IF THE GRATIFICATION OF THAT MOMENT HAD BEEN THE ONLY REWARD FOR ALL HER ANXIETY AND CARE IN OLIVERS BEHALF ROSE MAYLIE WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL REPAID THERE IS SOMEBODY ELSE WHO SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN BY THE BYE SAID MR BROWNLOW RINGING THE BELL SEND MRS BEDWIN HERE IF YOU PLEASE THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER ANSWERED THE SUMMONS WITH ALL DISPATCH AND DROPPING A CURTSEY AT THE DOOR WAITED FOR ORDERS WHY YOU GET BLINDER EVERY DAY BEDWIN SAID MR BROWNLOW RATHER TESTILY WELL THAT I DO SIR REPLIED THE OLD LADY PEOPLES EYES AT MY TIME OF LIFE DONT IMPROVE WITH AGE SIR I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT REJOINED MR BROWNLOW BUT PUT ON YOUR GLASSES AND SEE IF YOU CANT FIND OUT WHAT YOU WERE WANTED FOR WILL YOU THE OLD LADY BEGAN TO RUMMAGE IN HER POCKET FOR HER SPECTACLES BUT OLIVERS PATIENCE WAS NOT PROOF AGAINST THIS NEW TRIAL AND YIELDING TO HIS FIRST IMPULSE HE SPRANG INTO HER ARMS GOD BE GOOD TO ME CRIED THE OLD LADY EMBRACING HIM IT IS MY INNOCENT BOY MY DEAR OLD NURSE CRIED OLIVER HE WOULD COME BACKI KNEW HE WOULD SAID THE OLD LADY HOLDING HIM IN HER ARMS HOW WELL HE LOOKS AND HOW LIKE A GENTLEMANS SON HE IS DRESSED AGAIN WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THIS LONG LONG WHILE AH THE SAME SWEET FACE BUT NOT SO PALE THE SAME SOFT EYE BUT NOT SO SAD I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN THEM OR HIS QUIET SMILE BUT HAVE SEEN THEM EVERY DAY SIDE BY SIDE WITH THOSE OF MY OWN DEAR CHILDREN DEAD AND GONE SINCE I WAS A LIGHTSOME YOUNG CREATURE RUNNING ON THUS AND NOW HOLDING OLIVER FROM HER TO MARK HOW HE HAD GROWN NOW CLASPING HIM TO HER AND PASSING HER FINGERS FONDLY THROUGH HIS HAIR THE GOOD SOUL LAUGHED AND WEPT UPON HIS NECK BY TURNS LEAVING HER AND OLIVER TO COMPARE NOTES AT LEISURE MR BROWNLOW LED THE WAY INTO ANOTHER ROOM AND THERE HEARD FROM ROSE A FULL NARRATION OF HER INTERVIEW WITH NANCY WHICH OCCASIONED HIM NO LITTLE SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY ROSE ALSO EXPLAINED HER REASONS FOR NOT CONFIDING IN HER FRIEND MR LOSBERNE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE OLD GENTLEMAN CONSIDERED THAT SHE HAD ACTED PRUDENTLY AND READILY UNDERTOOK TO HOLD SOLEMN CONFERENCE WITH THE WORTHY DOCTOR HIMSELF TO AFFORD HIM AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THIS DESIGN IT WAS ARRANGED THAT HE SHOULD CALL AT THE HOTEL AT EIGHT OCLOCK THAT EVENING AND THAT IN THE MEANTIME MRS MAYLIE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUSLY INFORMED OF ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED THESE PRELIMINARIES ADJUSTED ROSE AND OLIVER RETURNED HOME ROSE HAD BY NO MEANS OVERRATED THE MEASURE OF THE GOOD DOCTORS WRATH NANCYS HISTORY WAS NO SOONER UNFOLDED TO HIM THAN HE POURED FORTH A SHOWER OF MINGLED THREATS AND EXECRATIONS THREATENED TO MAKE HER THE FIRST VICTIM OF THE COMBINED INGENUITY OF MESSRS BLATHERS AND DUFF AND ACTUALLY PUT ON HIS HAT PREPARATORY TO SALLYING FORTH TO OBTAIN THE ASSISTANCE OF THOSE WORTHIES AND DOUBTLESS HE WOULD IN THIS FIRST OUTBREAK HAVE CARRIED THE INTENTION INTO EFFECT WITHOUT A MOMENTS CONSIDERATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF HE HAD NOT BEEN RESTRAINED IN PART BY CORRESPONDING VIOLENCE ON THE SIDE OF MR BROWNLOW WHO WAS HIMSELF OF AN IRASCIBLE TEMPERAMENT AND PARTY BY SUCH ARGUMENTS AND REPRESENTATIONS AS SEEMED BEST CALCULATED TO DISSUADE HIM FROM HIS HOTBRAINED PURPOSE THEN WHAT THE DEVIL IS TO BE DONE SAID THE IMPETUOUS DOCTOR WHEN THEY HAD REJOINED THE TWO LADIES ARE WE TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO ALL THESE VAGABONDS MALE AND FEMALE AND BEG THEM TO ACCEPT A HUNDRED POUNDS OR SO APIECE AS A TRIFLING MARK OF OUR ESTEEM AND SOME SLIGHT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR KINDNESS TO OLIVER NOT EXACTLY THAT REJOINED MR BROWNLOW LAUGHING BUT WE MUST PROCEED GENTLY AND WITH GREAT CARE GENTLENESS AND CARE EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR ID SEND THEM ONE AND ALL TO NEVER MIND WHERE INTERPOSED MR BROWNLOW BUT REFLECT WHETHER SENDING THEM ANYWHERE IS LIKELY TO ATTAIN THE OBJECT WE HAVE IN VIEW WHAT OBJECT ASKED THE DOCTOR SIMPLY THE DISCOVERY OF OLIVERS PARENTAGE AND REGAINING FOR HIM THE INHERITANCE OF WHICH IF THIS STORY BE TRUE HE HAS BEEN FRAUDULENTLY DEPRIVED AH SAID MR LOSBERNE COOLING HIMSELF WITH HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF I ALMOST FORGOT THAT YOU SEE PURSUED MR BROWNLOW PLACING THIS POOR GIRL ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION AND SUPPOSING IT WERE POSSIBLE TO BRING THESE SCOUNDRELS TO JUSTICE WITHOUT COMPROMISING HER SAFETY WHAT GOOD SHOULD WE BRING ABOUT HANGING A FEW OF THEM AT LEAST IN ALL PROBABILITY SUGGESTED THE DOCTOR AND TRANSPORTING THE REST VERY GOOD REPLIED MR BROWNLOW SMILING BUT NO DOUBT THEY WILL BRING THAT ABOUT FOR THEMSELVES IN THE FULNESS OF TIME AND IF WE STEP IN TO FORESTALL THEM IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHALL BE PERFORMING A VERY QUIXOTIC ACT IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO OUR OWN INTERESTOR AT LEAST TO OLIVERS WHICH IS THE SAME THING HOW INQUIRED THE DOCTOR THUS IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT WE SHALL HAVE EXTREME DIFFICULTY IN GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS MYSTERY UNLESS WE CAN BRING THIS MAN MONKS UPON HIS KNEES THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY STRATAGEM AND BY CATCHING HIM WHEN HE IS NOT SURROUNDED BY THESE PEOPLE FOR SUPPOSE HE WERE APPREHENDED WE HAVE NO PROOF AGAINST HIM HE IS NOT EVEN SO FAR AS WE KNOW OR AS THE FACTS APPEAR TO US CONCERNED WITH THE GANG IN ANY OF THEIR ROBBERIES IF HE WERE NOT DISCHARGED IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT HE COULD RECEIVE ANY FURTHER PUNISHMENT THAN BEING COMMITTED TO PRISON AS A ROGUE AND VAGABOND AND OF COURSE EVER AFTERWARDS HIS MOUTH WOULD BE SO OBSTINATELY CLOSED THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL FOR OUR PURPOSES BE DEAF DUMB BLIND AND AN IDIOT THEN SAID THE DOCTOR IMPETUOUSLY I PUT IT TO YOU AGAIN WHETHER YOU THINK IT REASONABLE THAT THIS PROMISE TO THE GIRL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BINDING A PROMISE MADE WITH THE BEST AND KINDEST INTENTIONS BUT REALLY DO NOT DISCUSS THE POINT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY PRAY SAID MR BROWNLOW INTERRUPTING ROSE AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK THE PROMISE SHALL BE KEPT I DONT THINK IT WILL IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE INTERFERE WITH OUR PROCEEDINGS BUT BEFORE WE CAN RESOLVE UPON ANY PRECISE COURSE OF ACTION IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO SEE THE GIRL TO ASCERTAIN FROM HER WHETHER SHE WILL POINT OUT THIS MONKS ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT HE IS TO BE DEALT WITH BY US AND NOT BY THE LAW OR IF SHE WILL NOT OR CANNOT DO THAT TO PROCURE FROM HER SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF HIS HAUNTS AND DESCRIPTION OF HIS PERSON AS WILL ENABLE US TO IDENTIFY HIM SHE CANNOT BE SEEN UNTIL NEXT SUNDAY NIGHT THIS IS TUESDAY I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IN THE MEANTIME WE REMAIN PERFECTLY QUIET AND KEEP THESE MATTERS SECRET EVEN FROM OLIVER HIMSELF ALTHOUGH MR LOSBERNE RECEIVED WITH MANY WRY FACES A PROPOSAL INVOLVING A DELAY OF FIVE WHOLE DAYS HE WAS FAIN TO ADMIT THAT NO BETTER COURSE OCCURRED TO HIM JUST THEN AND AS BOTH ROSE AND MRS MAYLIE SIDED VERY STRONGLY WITH MR BROWNLOW THAT GENTLEMANS PROPOSITION WAS CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY I SHOULD LIKE HE SAID TO CALL IN THE AID OF MY FRIEND GRIMWIG HE IS A STRANGE CREATURE BUT A SHREWD ONE AND MIGHT PROVE OF MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO US I SHOULD SAY THAT HE WAS BRED A LAWYER AND QUITTED THE BAR IN DISGUST BECAUSE HE HAD ONLY ONE BRIEF AND A MOTION OF COURSE IN TWENTY YEARS THOUGH WHETHER THAT IS RECOMMENDATION OR NOT YOU MUST DETERMINE FOR YOURSELVES I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO YOUR CALLING IN YOUR FRIEND IF I MAY CALL IN MINE SAID THE DOCTOR WE MUST PUT IT TO THE VOTE REPLIED MR BROWNLOW WHO MAY HE BE THAT LADYS SON AND THIS YOUNG LADYSVERY OLD FRIEND SAID THE DOCTOR MOTIONING TOWARDS MRS MAYLIE AND CONCLUDING WITH AN EXPRESSIVE GLANCE AT HER NIECE ROSE BLUSHED DEEPLY BUT SHE DID NOT MAKE ANY AUDIBLE OBJECTION TO THIS MOTION POSSIBLY SHE FELT IN A HOPELESS MINORITY AND HARRY MAYLIE AND MR GRIMWIG WERE ACCORDINGLY ADDED TO THE COMMITTEE WE STAY IN TOWN OF COURSE SAID MRS MAYLIE WHILE THERE REMAINS THE SLIGHTEST PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING THIS INQUIRY WITH A CHANCE OF SUCCESS I WILL SPARE NEITHER TROUBLE NOR EXPENSE IN BEHALF OF THE OBJECT IN WHICH WE ARE ALL SO DEEPLY INTERESTED AND I AM CONTENT TO REMAIN HERE IF IT BE FOR TWELVE MONTHS SO LONG AS YOU ASSURE ME THAT ANY HOPE REMAINS GOOD REJOINED MR BROWNLOW AND AS I SEE ON THE FACES ABOUT ME A DISPOSITION TO INQUIRE HOW IT HAPPENED THAT I WAS NOT IN THE WAY TO CORROBORATE OLIVERS TALE AND HAD SO SUDDENLY LEFT THE KINGDOM LET ME STIPULATE THAT I SHALL BE ASKED NO QUESTIONS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS I MAY DEEM IT EXPEDIENT TO FORESTALL THEM BY TELLING MY OWN STORY BELIEVE ME I MAKE THIS REQUEST WITH GOOD REASON FOR I MIGHT OTHERWISE EXCITE HOPES DESTINED NEVER TO BE REALISED AND ONLY INCREASE DIFFICULTIES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS ALREADY QUITE NUMEROUS ENOUGH COME SUPPER HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED AND YOUNG OLIVER WHO IS ALL ALONE IN THE NEXT ROOM WILL HAVE BEGUN TO THINK BY THIS TIME THAT WE HAVE WEARIED OF HIS COMPANY AND ENTERED INTO SOME DARK CONSPIRACY TO THRUST HIM FORTH UPON THE WORLD WITH THESE WORDS THE OLD GENTLEMAN GAVE HIS HAND TO MRS MAYLIE AND ESCORTED HER INTO THE SUPPERROOM MR LOSBERNE FOLLOWED LEADING ROSE AND THE COUNCIL WAS FOR THE PRESENT EFFECTUALLY BROKEN UP CHAPTER XLII AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVERS EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS UPON THE NIGHT WHEN NANCY HAVING LULLED MR SIKES TO SLEEP HURRIED ON HER SELFIMPOSED MISSION TO ROSE MAYLIE THERE ADVANCED TOWARDS LONDON BY THE GREAT NORTH ROAD TWO PERSONS UPON WHOM IT IS EXPEDIENT THAT THIS HISTORY SHOULD BESTOW SOME ATTENTION THEY WERE A MAN AND WOMAN OR PERHAPS THEY WOULD BE BETTER DESCRIBED AS A MALE AND FEMALE FOR THE FORMER WAS ONE OF

OVERGROWN BOYS THE WOMAN WAS YOUNG BUT OF A ROBUST AND HARDY MAKE AS SHE NEED HAVE BEEN TO BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THE HEAVY BUNDLE WHICH WAS STRAPPED TO HER BACK HER COMPANION WAS NOT ENCUMBERED WITH MUCH LUGGAGE AS THERE MERELY DANGLED FROM A STICK WHICH HE CARRIED OVER HIS SHOULDER A SMALL PARCEL WRAPPED IN A COMMON HANDKERCHIEF AND APPARENTLY LIGHT ENOUGH THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ADDED TO THE LENGTH OF HIS LEGS WHICH WERE OF UNUSUAL EXTENT ENABLED HIM WITH MUCH EASE TO KEEP SOME HALFDOZEN PACES IN ADVANCE OF HIS COMPANION TO WHOM HE OCCASIONALLY TURNED WITH AN IMPATIENT JERK OF THE HEAD AS IF REPROACHING HER TARDINESS AND URGING HER TO GREATER EXERTION THUS THEY HAD TOILED ALONG THE DUSTY ROAD TAKING LITTLE HEED OF ANY OBJECT WITHIN SIGHT SAVE WHEN THEY STEPPED ASIDE TO ALLOW A WIDER PASSAGE FOR THE MAILCOACHES WHICH WERE WHIRLING OUT OF TOWN UNTIL THEY PASSED THROUGH HIGHGATE ARCHWAY WHEN THE FOREMOST TRAVELLER STOPPED AND CALLED IMPATIENTLY TO HIS COMPANION COME ON CANT YER WHAT

NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL IN LONDON IT WAS PAST ELEVEN OCLOCK AND THE DOOR WAS CLOSED IT OPENED SOFTLY ON ITS HINGES AS FAGIN GAVE A LOW WHISTLE THEY ENTERED WITHOUT NOISE AND THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND THEM SCARCELY VENTURING TO WHISPER BUT SUBSTITUTING DUMB SHOW FOR WORDS FAGIN AND THE YOUNG JEW WHO HAD ADMITTED THEM POINTED OUT THE PANE OF GLASS TO NOAH AND SIGNED TO HIM TO CLIMB UP AND OBSERVE

ROUND TWICE OR THRICE AND ONCE STOPPED TO LET TWO MEN WHO WERE FOLLOWING CLOSE BEHIND HER PASS ON SHE SEEMED TO GATHER COURAGE AS SHE ADVANCED AND TO WALK WITH A STEADIER AND FIRMER STEP THE SPY PRESERVED THE SAME RELATIVE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM AND FOLLOWED WITH HIS EYE UPON HER CHAPTER XLVI THE APPOINTMENT KEPT THE CHURCH CLOCKS CHIMED THREE QUARTERS PAST ELEVEN AS TWO FIGURES EMERGED ON LONDON BRIDGE ONE WHICH ADVANCED WITH A SWIFT AND RAPID STEP WAS THAT OF A WOMAN WHO LOOKED EAGERLY ABOUT HER AS THOUGH IN QUEST OF SOME EXPECTED OBJECT THE OTHER FIGURE WAS THAT OF A MAN WHO SLUNK ALONG IN THE DEEPEST SHADOW HE COULD FIND AND AT SOME DISTANCE ACCOMMODATED HIS PACE TO HERS STOPPING WHEN SHE STOPPED AND AS SHE MOVED AGAIN CREEPING STEALTHILY ON BUT NEVER ALLOWING HIMSELF IN THE ARDOUR OF HIS PURSUIT TO GAIN UPON HER FOOTSTEPS THUS THEY CROSSED THE BRIDGE FROM THE MIDDLESEX TO THE SURREY SHORE WHEN THE WOMAN APPARENTLY DISAPPOINTED IN HER ANXIOUS SCRUTINY OF THE FOOTPASSENGERS TURNED BACK THE MOVEMENT WAS SUDDEN BUT HE WHO WATCHED HER WAS NOT THROWN OFF HIS GUARD BY IT FOR SHRINKING INTO ONE OF THE RECESSES WHICH SURMOUNT THE PIERS OF THE BRIDGE AND LEANING OVER THE PARAPET THE BETTER TO CONCEAL HIS FIGURE HE SUFFERED HER TO PASS ON THE OPPOSITE PAVEMENT WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE IN ADVANCE AS SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE HE SLIPPED QUIETLY DOWN AND FOLLOWED HER AGAIN AT NEARLY THE CENTRE OF THE BRIDGE SHE STOPPED THE MAN STOPPED TOO IT WAS A VERY DARK NIGHT THE DAY HAD BEEN UNFAVOURABLE AND AT THAT HOUR AND PLACE THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE STIRRING SUCH AS THERE WERE HURRIED QUICKLY PAST VERY POSSIBLY WITHOUT SEEING BUT CERTAINLY WITHOUT NOTICING EITHER THE WOMAN OR THE MAN WHO KEPT HER IN VIEW THEIR APPEARANCE WAS NOT CALCULATED TO ATTRACT THE IMPORTUNATE REGARDS OF SUCH OF LONDONS DESTITUTE POPULATION AS CHANCED TO TAKE THEIR WAY OVER THE BRIDGE THAT NIGHT IN SEARCH OF SOME COLD ARCH OR DOORLESS HOVEL WHEREIN TO LAY THEIR HEADS THEY STOOD THERE IN SILENCE NEITHER SPEAKING NOR SPOKEN TO BY ANY ONE WHO PASSED A MIST HUNG OVER THE RIVER DEEPENING THE RED GLARE OF THE FIRES THAT BURNT UPON THE SMALL CRAFT MOORED OFF THE DIFFERENT WHARFS

STERNLY UPON WATER TOO BLACK TO REFLECT EVEN THEIR LUMBERING SHAPES THE TOWER OF OLD SAINT SAVIOURS CHURCH AND THE SPIRE OF SAINT MAGNUS SO LONG THE GIANTWARDERS OF THE ANCIENT BRIDGE WERE VISIBLE IN THE GLOOM BUT THE FOREST OF SHIPPING BELOW BRIDGE AND THE THICKLY SCATTERED SPIRES OF CHURCHES ABOVE WERE NEARLY ALL HIDDEN FROM SIGHT THE GIRL HAD TAKEN A FEW RESTLESS TURNS TO AND FROCLOSELY WATCHED MEANWHILE BY HER HIDDEN OBSERVERWHEN THE HEAVY BELL OF ST PAULS TOLLED FOR THE DEATH OF ANOTHER DAY MIDNIGHT HAD COME UPON THE CROWDED CITY THE PALACE THE NIGHTCELLAR THE JAIL THE MADHOUSE THE CHAMBERS OF BIRTH AND DEATH OF HEALTH AND SICKNESS THE RIGID FACE OF THE CORPSE AND THE CALM SLEEP OF THE CHILD MIDNIGHT WAS UPON THEM ALL THE HOUR HAD NOT STRUCK TWO MINUTES WHEN A YOUNG LADY ACCOMPANIED BY A GREYHAIRED GENTLEMAN ALIGHTED FROM A HACKNEYCARRIAGE WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE BRIDGE AND HAVING DISMISSED THE VEHICLE WALKED STRAIGHT TOWARDS IT THEY HAD SCARCELY SET FOOT UPON ITS PAVEMENT WHEN THE GIRL STARTED AND IMMEDIATELY MADE TOWARDS THEM THEY WALKED ONWARD LOOKING ABOUT THEM WITH THE AIR OF PERSONS WHO ENTERTAINED SOME VERY SLIGHT EXPECTATION WHICH HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF BEING REALISED WHEN THEY WERE SUDDENLY JOINED BY THIS NEW ASSOCIATE THEY HALTED WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE BUT SUPPRESSED IT IMMEDIATELY FOR A MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A COUNTRYMAN CAME CLOSE

COUNTRYMAN HASTENED UNOBSERVED AND AFTER A MOMENTS SURVEY OF THE PLACE HE BEGAN TO DESCEND THESE STAIRS ARE A PART OF THE BRIDGE THEY CONSIST OF THREE FLIGHTS JUST BELOW THE END OF THE SECOND GOING DOWN THE STONE WALL ON THE LEFT TERMINATES IN AN ORNAMENTAL PILASTER FACING TOWARDS THE THAMES AT THIS POINT THE LOWER STEPS WIDEN SO THAT A PERSON TURNING THAT ANGLE OF THE WALL IS NECESSARILY UNSEEN

DREADFUL THE NARROW WAYS WERE COMPLETELY BLOCKED UP AND AT THIS TIME BETWEEN THE RUSH OF SOME TO REGAIN THE SPACE IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND THE UNAVAILING STRUGGLES OF OTHERS TO EXTRICATE THEMSELVES FROM THE MASS THE IMMEDIATE ATTENTION WAS DISTRACTED FROM THE MURDERER ALTHOUGH THE UNIVERSAL EAGERNESS FOR HIS CAPTURE WAS IF POSSIBLE INCREASED THE MAN HAD SHRUNK DOWN THOROUGHLY QUELLED BY THE FEROCITY OF THE CROWD AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ESCAPE BUT SEEING THIS SUDDEN CHANGE WITH NO LESS RAPIDITY THAN IT HAD OCCURRED HE SPRANG UPON HIS FEET DETERMINED TO MAKE ONE LAST EFFORT FOR HIS LIFE BY DROPPING INTO THE DITCH AND AT THE RISK OF BEING STIFLED ENDEAVOURING TO CREEP AWAY IN THE DARKNESS AND CONFUSION ROUSED INTO NEW STRENGTH AND ENERGY AND STIMULATED BY THE NOISE WITHIN THE HOUSE

RAILING OF THE BRIDGE AS TO RESIST THE FORCE OF THE CROWD AND RETAIN HIS POSITION EARNESTLY WARNED THOSE ABOUT HIM THAT THE MAN WAS ABOUT TO LOWER HIMSELF DOWNAT THAT VERY INSTANT THE MURDERER LOOKING BEHIND HIM ON THE ROOF THREW HIS ARMS ABOVE HIS HEAD AND UTTERED A YELL OF TERROR THE EYES AGAIN HE CRIED IN AN UNEARTHLY SCREECH STAGGERING AS IF STRUCK BY LIGHTNING HE LOST HIS BALANCE AND TUMBLED OVER THE PARAPET THE NOOSE WAS ON HIS NECK IT RAN UP WITH HIS WEIGHT TIGHT AS A BOWSTRING AND SWIFT AS THE ARROW IT SPEEDS HE FELL FOR FIVEANDTHIRTY FEET THERE WAS A SUDDEN JERK A TERRIFIC CONVULSION OF THE LIMBS AND THERE HE HUNG WITH THE OPEN KNIFE CLENCHED IN HIS STIFFENING HAND THE OLD CHIMNEY QUIVERED WITH THE SHOCK BUT STOOD IT BRAVELY THE MURDERER SWUNG LIFELESS AGAINST THE WALL AND THE BOY THRUSTING ASIDE THE DANGLING BODY WHICH OBSCURED HIS VIEW CALLED TO THE PEOPLE TO COME AND TAKE HIM OUT FOR GODS SAKE A DOG WHICH HAD LAIN CONCEALED TILL NOW RAN BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ON THE PARAPET WITH A DISMAL HOWL AND COLLECTING HIMSELF FOR A SPRING JUMPED FOR THE DEAD MANS SHOULDERS MISSING HIS AIM HE FELL INTO THE DITCH TURNING COMPLETELY OVER AS HE WENT AND STRIKING HIS HEAD AGAINST A STONE DASHED OUT HIS BRAINS CHAPTER LI AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PINMONEY THE EVENTS NARRATED IN THE LAST CHAPTER WERE YET BUT TWO DAYS OLD WHEN OLIVER FOUND HIMSELF AT THREE OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON IN A TRAVELLINGCARRIAGE ROLLING FAST TOWARDS HIS NATIVE TOWN MRS MAYLIE AND ROSE AND MRS BEDWIN AND THE GOOD DOCTOR WERE WITH HIM AND MR BROWNLOW FOLLOWED IN A POSTCHAISE ACCOMPANIED BY ONE OTHER PERSON WHOSE NAME HAD NOT BEEN MENTIONED THEY HAD NOT TALKED MUCH UPON THE WAY FOR OLIVER WAS IN A FLUTTER OF AGITATION AND UNCERTAINTY WHICH DEPRIVED HIM OF THE POWER OF COLLECTING HIS THOUGHTS AND ALMOST OF SPEECH AND APPEARED TO HAVE SCARCELY LESS EFFECT ON HIS COMPANIONS WHO SHARED IT IN AT LEAST AN EQUAL DEGREE HE AND THE TWO LADIES HAD BEEN VERY CAREFULLY MADE ACQUAINTED BY MR BROWNLOW WITH THE NATURE OF THE ADMISSIONS WHICH HAD BEEN FORCED FROM MONKS AND ALTHOUGH THEY KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF THEIR PRESENT JOURNEY WAS TO COMPLETE THE WORK WHICH HAD BEEN SO WELL BEGUN STILL THE WHOLE MATTER WAS ENVELOPED IN ENOUGH OF DOUBT AND MYSTERY TO LEAVE THEM IN ENDURANCE OF THE MOST INTENSE SUSPENSE THE SAME KIND FRIEND HAD WITH MR LOSBERNES ASSISTANCE CAUTIOUSLY STOPPED ALL CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION THROUGH WHICH THEY COULD RECEIVE INTELLIGENCE OF THE DREADFUL OCCURRENCES THAT SO RECENTLY TAKEN PLACE IT WAS QUITE TRUE HE SAID THAT THEY MUST KNOW THEM BEFORE LONG BUT IT MIGHT BE AT A BETTER TIME THAN THE PRESENT AND IT COULD NOT BE AT A WORSE SO THEY TRAVELLED ON IN SILENCE EACH BUSIED WITH REFLECTIONS ON THE OBJECT WHICH HAD BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER AND NO ONE DISPOSED TO GIVE UTTERANCE TO THE THOUGHTS WHICH CROWDED UPON ALL BUT IF OLIVER UNDER THESE INFLUENCES HAD REMAINED SILENT WHILE THEY JOURNEYED TOWARDS HIS BIRTHPLACE BY A ROAD HE HAD NEVER SEEN HOW THE WHOLE CURRENT OF HIS RECOLLECTIONS RAN BACK TO OLD TIMES AND WHAT A CROWD OF EMOTIONS WERE WAKENED UP IN HIS BREAST WHEN THEY TURNED INTO THAT WHICH HE HAD TRAVERSED ON FOOT A POOR HOUSELESS WANDERING BOY WITHOUT A FRIEND TO HELP HIM OR A ROOF TO SHELTER HIS HEAD SEE THERE THERE CRIED OLIVER EAGERLY

SCANDAL HE BEING YOUNG AND A CLERGYMAN OLIVER MY CHILD SAID MRS MAYLIE WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN AND WHY DO YOU LOOK SO SAD THERE ARE TEARS STEALING DOWN YOUR FACE AT THIS MOMENT WHAT IS THE MATTER IT IS A WORLD OF DISAPPOINTMENT OFTEN TO THE HOPES WE MOST CHERISH AND HOPES THAT DO OUR NATURE THE GREATEST HONOUR POOR DICK WAS DEAD CHAPTER LII FAGINS LAST NIGHT ALIVE THE COURT WAS PAVED FROM FLOOR TO ROOF WITH HUMAN FACES INQUISITIVE AND EAGER EYES PEERED FROM EVERY INCH OF SPACE FROM THE RAIL BEFORE THE DOCK AWAY INTO THE SHARPEST ANGLE OF THE SMALLEST CORNER IN THE GALLERIES ALL LOOKS WERE FIXED UPON ONE MANFAGIN BEFORE HIM AND BEHIND ABOVE BELOW ON THE RIGHT AND ON THE LEFT HE SEEMED TO STAND SURROUNDED BY A FIRMAMENT ALL BRIGHT WITH GLEAMING EYES HE STOOD THERE IN ALL THIS GLARE OF LIVING LIGHT WITH ONE HAND RESTING ON THE WOODEN SLAB BEFORE HIM THE OTHER HELD TO HIS EAR AND HIS HEAD THRUST FORWARD TO ENABLE HIM TO CATCH WITH GREATER DISTINCTNESS EVERY WORD THAT FELL FROM THE PRESIDING JUDGE WHO WAS DELIVERING HIS CHARGE TO THE JURY AT TIMES HE TURNED HIS EYES SHARPLY UPON THEM TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT OF THE SLIGHTEST FEATHERWEIGHT IN HIS FAVOUR AND WHEN THE POINTS AGAINST HIM WERE STATED WITH TERRIBLE DISTINCTNESS LOOKED TOWARDS HIS COUNSEL IN MUTE APPEAL THAT HE WOULD EVEN THEN URGE SOMETHING IN HIS BEHALF BEYOND THESE MANIFESTATIONS OF ANXIETY HE STIRRED NOT HAND OR FOOT HE HAD SCARCELY MOVED SINCE THE TRIAL BEGAN AND NOW THAT THE JUDGE CEASED TO SPEAK HE STILL REMAINED IN THE SAME STRAINED ATTITUDE OF CLOSE ATTENTION WITH HIS GAZE BENT ON HIM AS THOUGH HE LISTENED STILL A SLIGHT BUSTLE IN THE COURT RECALLED HIM TO HIMSELF LOOKING ROUND HE SAW THAT THE JURYMAN HAD TURNED TOGETHER TO CONSIDER THEIR VERDICT AS HIS EYES WANDERED TO THE GALLERY HE COULD SEE THE PEOPLE RISING ABOVE EACH OTHER TO SEE HIS FACE SOME HASTILY APPLYING THEIR GLASSES TO THEIR EYES AND OTHERS WHISPERING THEIR NEIGHBOURS WITH LOOKS EXPRESSIVE OF ABHORRENCE A FEW THERE WERE WHO SEEMED UNMINDFUL OF HIM AND LOOKED ONLY TO THE JURY IN IMPATIENT WONDER HOW THEY COULD DELAY BUT IN NO ONE FACENOT EVEN AMONG THE WOMEN OF WHOM THERE WERE MANY THERECOULD HE READ THE FAINTEST SYMPATHY WITH HIMSELF OR ANY FEELING BUT ONE OF ALLABSORBING INTEREST THAT HE SHOULD BE CONDEMNED AS HE SAW ALL THIS IN ONE BEWILDERED GLANCE THE DEATHLIKE STILLNESS CAME AGAIN AND LOOKING BACK HE SAW THAT THE JURYMEN HAD TURNED TOWARDS THE JUDGE HUSH THEY ONLY SOUGHT PERMISSION TO RETIRE HE LOOKED WISTFULLY INTO THEIR FACES ONE BY ONE WHEN THEY PASSED OUT AS THOUGH TO SEE WHICH WAY THE GREATER NUMBER LEANT BUT THAT WAS FRUITLESS THE JAILER TOUCHED HIM ON THE SHOULDER HE FOLLOWED MECHANICALLY TO THE END OF THE DOCK AND SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR THE MAN POINTED IT OUT OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN IT HE LOOKED UP INTO THE GALLERY AGAIN SOME OF THE PEOPLE WERE EATING AND SOME FANNING THEMSELVES WITH HANDKERCHIEFS FOR THE CROWDED PLACE WAS VERY HOT THERE WAS ONE YOUNG MAN SKETCHING HIS FACE IN A LITTLE NOTEBOOK HE WONDERED WHETHER IT WAS LIKE AND LOOKED ON WHEN THE ARTIST BROKE HIS PENCILPOINT AND MADE ANOTHER WITH HIS KNIFE AS ANY IDLE SPECTATOR MIGHT HAVE DONE IN THE SAME WAY WHEN HE TURNED HIS EYES TOWARDS THE JUDGE HIS MIND BEGAN TO BUSY ITSELF WITH THE FASHION OF HIS DRESS AND WHAT IT COST AND HOW HE PUT IT ON THERE WAS AN OLD FAT GENTLEMAN ON THE BENCH TOO WHO HAD GONE OUT SOME HALF AN HOUR BEFORE AND NOW COME BACK HE WONDERED WITHIN HIMSELF WHETHER THIS MAN HAD BEEN TO GET HIS DINNER WHAT HE HAD HAD AND WHERE HE HAD HAD IT AND PURSUED THIS TRAIN OF CARELESS THOUGHT UNTIL SOME NEW OBJECT CAUGHT HIS EYE AND ROUSED ANOTHER NOT THAT ALL THIS TIME HIS MIND WAS FOR AN INSTANT FREE FROM ONE OPPRESSIVE OVERWHELMING SENSE OF THE GRAVE THAT OPENED AT HIS FEET IT WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIM BUT IN A VAGUE AND GENERAL WAY AND HE COULD NOT FIX HIS THOUGHTS UPON IT THUS EVEN WHILE HE TREMBLED AND TURNED BURNING HOT AT THE IDEA OF SPEEDY DEATH HE FELL TO COUNTING THE IRON SPIKES BEFORE HIM AND WONDERING HOW THE HEAD OF ONE HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF AND WHETHER THEY WOULD MEND IT OR LEAVE IT AS IT WAS THEN HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE HORRORS OF THE GALLOWS AND THE SCAFFOLDAND STOPPED TO WATCH A MAN SPRINKLING THE FLOOR TO COOL ITAND THEN WENT ON TO THINK AGAIN AT LENGTH THERE WAS A CRY OF SILENCE AND A BREATHLESS LOOK FROM ALL TOWARDS THE DOOR THE JURY RETURNED AND PASSED HIM CLOSE HE COULD GLEAN NOTHING FROM THEIR FACES THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN OF STONE PERFECT STILLNESS ENSUEDNOT A RUSTLENOT A BREATHGUILTY THE BUILDING RANG WITH A TREMENDOUS SHOUT AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND THEN IT ECHOED LOUD GROANS THAT GATHERED STRENGTH AS THEY SWELLED OUT LIKE ANGRY THUNDER IT WAS A PEAL OF JOY FROM THE POPULACE OUTSIDE GREETING THE NEWS THAT HE WOULD DIE ON MONDAY THE NOISE SUBSIDED AND HE WAS ASKED IF HE HAD ANYTHING TO SAY WHY SENTENCE OF DEATH SHOULD NOT BE PASSED UPON HIM HE HAD RESUMED HIS LISTENING ATTITUDE AND LOOKED INTENTLY AT HIS QUESTIONER WHILE THE DEMAND WAS MADE BUT IT WAS TWICE REPEATED BEFORE HE SEEMED TO HEAR IT AND THEN HE ONLY MUTTERED THAT HE WAS AN OLD MANAN OLD MANAND SO DROPPING INTO A WHISPER WAS SILENT AGAIN THE JUDGE ASSUMED THE BLACK CAP AND THE PRISONER STILL STOOD WITH THE SAME AIR AND GESTURE A WOMAN IN THE GALLERY UTTERED SOME EXCLAMATION CALLED FORTH BY THIS DREAD SOLEMNITY HE LOOKED HASTILY UP AS IF ANGRY AT THE INTERRUPTION AND BENT FORWARD YET MORE ATTENTIVELY THE ADDRESS WAS SOLEMN AND IMPRESSIVE THE SENTENCE FEARFUL TO HEAR BUT HE STOOD LIKE A MARBLE FIGURE WITHOUT THE MOTION OF A NERVE HIS HAGGARD FACE WAS STILL THRUST FORWARD HIS UNDERJAW HANGING DOWN AND HIS EYES STARING OUT BEFORE HIM WHEN THE JAILER PUT HIS HAND UPON HIS ARM AND BECKONED HIM AWAY HE GAZED STUPIDLY ABOUT HIM FOR AN INSTANT AND OBEYED THEY LED HIM THROUGH A PAVED ROOM UNDER THE COURT WHERE SOME PRISONERS WERE WAITING TILL THEIR TURNS CAME AND OTHERS WERE TALKING TO THEIR FRIENDS WHO CROWDED ROUND A GRATE WHICH LOOKED INTO THE OPEN YARD THERE WAS NOBODY THERE TO SPEAK TO HIM BUT AS HE PASSED THE PRISONERS FELL BACK TO RENDER HIM MORE VISIBLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLINGING TO THE BARS AND THEY ASSAILED HIM WITH OPPROBRIOUS NAMES AND SCREECHED AND HISSED HE SHOOK HIS FIST AND WOULD HAVE SPAT UPON THEM BUT HIS CONDUCTORS HURRIED HIM ON THROUGH A GLOOMY PASSAGE LIGHTED BY A FEW DIM LAMPS INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE PRISON HERE HE WAS SEARCHED THAT HE MIGHT NOT HAVE ABOUT HIM THE MEANS OF ANTICIPATING THE LAW THIS CEREMONY PERFORMED THEY LED HIM TO ONE OF THE CONDEMNED CELLS AND LEFT HIM THEREALONE HE SAT DOWN ON A STONE BENCH OPPOSITE THE DOOR WHICH SERVED FOR SEAT AND BEDSTEAD AND CASTING HIS BLOODSHOT EYES UPON THE GROUND TRIED TO COLLECT HIS THOUGHTS AFTER AWHILE HE BEGAN TO REMEMBER A FEW DISJOINTED FRAGMENTS OF WHAT THE JUDGE HAD SAID THOUGH IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM AT THE TIME THAT HE COULD NOT HEAR A WORD THESE GRADUALLY FELL INTO THEIR PROPER PLACES AND BY DEGREES SUGGESTED MORE SO THAT IN A LITTLE TIME HE HAD THE WHOLE ALMOST AS IT WAS DELIVERED TO BE HANGED BY THE NECK TILL HE WAS DEADTHAT WAS THE END TO BE HANGED BY THE NECK TILL HE WAS DEAD AS IT CAME ON VERY DARK HE BEGAN TO THINK OF ALL THE MEN HE HAD KNOWN WHO HAD DIED UPON THE SCAFFOLD SOME OF THEM THROUGH HIS MEANS THEY ROSE UP IN SUCH QUICK SUCCESSION THAT HE COULD HARDLY COUNT THEM HE HAD SEEN SOME OF THEM DIEAND HAD JOKED TOO BECAUSE THEY DIED WITH PRAYERS UPON THEIR LIPS WITH WHAT A RATTLING NOISE THE DROP WENT DOWN AND HOW SUDDENLY THEY CHANGED FROM STRONG AND VIGOROUS MEN TO DANGLING HEAPS OF CLOTHES SOME OF THEM MIGHT HAVE INHABITED THAT VERY CELLSAT UPON THAT VERY SPOT IT WAS VERY DARK WHY DIDNT THEY BRING A LIGHT THE CELL HAD BEEN BUILT FOR MANY YEARS SCORES OF MEN MUST HAVE PASSED THEIR LAST HOURS THERE IT WAS LIKE SITTING IN A VAULT STREWN WITH DEAD BODIESTHE CAP THE NOOSE THE PINIONED ARMS THE FACES THAT HE KNEW EVEN BENEATH THAT HIDEOUS VEILLIGHT LIGHT AT LENGTH WHEN HIS HANDS WERE RAW WITH BEATING AGAINST THE HEAVY DOOR AND WALLS TWO MEN APPEARED ONE BEARING A CANDLE WHICH HE THRUST INTO AN IRON CANDLESTICK FIXED AGAINST THE WALL THE OTHER DRAGGING IN A MATTRESS ON WHICH TO PASS THE NIGHT FOR THE PRISONER WAS TO BE LEFT ALONE NO MORE THEN CAME THE NIGHTDARK DISMAL SILENT NIGHT OTHER WATCHERS ARE GLAD TO HEAR THIS CHURCHCLOCK STRIKE FOR THEY TELL OF LIFE AND COMING DAY TO HIM THEY BROUGHT DESPAIR THE BOOM OF EVERY IRON BELL CAME LADEN WITH THE ONE DEEP HOLLOW SOUNDDEATH WHAT AVAILED THE NOISE AND BUSTLE OF CHEERFUL MORNING WHICH PENETRATED EVEN THERE TO HIM IT WAS ANOTHER FORM OF KNELL WITH MOCKERY ADDED TO THE WARNING THE DAY PASSED OFF DAY THERE WAS NO DAY IT WAS GONE AS SOON AS COMEAND NIGHT CAME ON AGAIN NIGHT SO LONG AND YET SO SHORT LONG IN ITS DREADFUL SILENCE AND SHORT IN ITS FLEETING HOURS AT ONE TIME HE RAVED AND BLASPHEMED AND AT ANOTHER HOWLED AND TORE HIS HAIR VENERABLE MEN OF HIS OWN PERSUASION HAD COME TO PRAY BESIDE HIM BUT HE HAD DRIVEN THEM AWAY WITH CURSES THEY RENEWED THEIR CHARITABLE EFFORTS AND HE BEAT THEM OFF SATURDAY NIGHT HE HAD ONLY ONE NIGHT MORE TO LIVE AND AS HE THOUGHT OF THIS THE DAY BROKESUNDAY IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE NIGHT OF THIS LAST AWFUL DAY THAT A WITHERING SENSE OF HIS HELPLESS DESPERATE STATE CAME IN ITS FULL INTENSITY UPON HIS BLIGHTED SOUL NOT THAT HE HAD EVER HELD ANY DEFINED OR POSITIVE HOPE OF MERCY BUT THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CONSIDER MORE THAN THE DIM PROBABILITY OF DYING SO SOON HE HAD SPOKEN LITTLE TO EITHER OF THE TWO MEN WHO RELIEVED EACH OTHER IN THEIR ATTENDANCE UPON HIM AND THEY FOR THEIR PARTS MADE NO EFFORT TO ROUSE HIS ATTENTION HE HAD SAT THERE AWAKE BUT DREAMING NOW HE STARTED UP EVERY MINUTE AND WITH GASPING MOUTH AND BURNING SKIN HURRIED TO AND FRO IN SUCH A PAROXYSM OF FEAR AND WRATH THAT EVEN THEYUSED TO SUCH SIGHTSRECOILED FROM HIM WITH HORROR HE GREW SO TERRIBLE AT LAST IN ALL THE TORTURES OF HIS EVIL CONSCIENCE THAT ONE MAN COULD NOT BEAR TO SIT THERE EYEING HIM ALONE AND SO THE TWO KEPT WATCH TOGETHER HE COWERED DOWN UPON HIS STONE BED AND THOUGHT OF THE PAST HE HAD BEEN WOUNDED WITH SOME MISSILES FROM THE CROWD ON THE DAY OF HIS CAPTURE AND HIS HEAD WAS BANDAGED WITH A LINEN CLOTH HIS RED HAIR HUNG DOWN UPON HIS BLOODLESS FACE HIS BEARD WAS TORN AND TWISTED INTO KNOTS HIS EYES SHONE WITH A TERRIBLE LIGHT HIS UNWASHED FLESH CRACKLED WITH THE FEVER THAT BURNT HIM UP EIGHTNINETHEN IF IT WAS NOT A TRICK TO FRIGHTEN HIM AND THOSE WERE THE REAL HOURS TREADING ON EACH OTHERS HEELS WHERE WOULD HE BE WHEN THEY CAME ROUND AGAIN ELEVEN ANOTHER STRUCK BEFORE THE VOICE OF THE PREVIOUS HOUR HAD CEASED TO VIBRATE AT EIGHT HE WOULD BE THE ONLY MOURNER IN HIS OWN FUNERAL TRAIN AT ELEVEN THOSE DREADFUL WALLS OF NEWGATE WHICH HAVE HIDDEN SO MUCH MISERY AND SUCH UNSPEAKABLE ANGUISH NOT ONLY FROM THE EYES BUT TOO OFTEN AND TOO LONG FROM THE THOUGHTS OF MEN NEVER HELD SO DREAD A SPECTACLE AS THAT THE FEW WHO LINGERED AS THEY PASSED AND WONDERED WHAT THE MAN WAS DOING WHO WAS TO BE HANGED TOMORROW WOULD HAVE SLEPT BUT ILL THAT NIGHT IF THEY COULD HAVE SEEN HIM FROM EARLY IN THE EVENING UNTIL NEARLY MIDNIGHT LITTLE GROUPS OF TWO AND THREE PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE LODGEGATE AND INQUIRED WITH ANXIOUS FACES WHETHER ANY REPRIEVE HAD BEEN RECEIVED THESE BEING ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE COMMUNICATED THE WELCOME INTELLIGENCE TO CLUSTERS IN THE STREET WHO POINTED OUT TO ONE ANOTHER THE DOOR FROM WHICH HE MUST COME OUT AND SHOWED WHERE THE SCAFFOLD WOULD BE BUILT AND WALKING WITH UNWILLING STEPS AWAY TURNED BACK TO CONJURE UP THE SCENE BY DEGREES THEY FELL OFF ONE BY ONE AND FOR AN HOUR IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT THE STREET WAS LEFT TO SOLITUDE AND DARKNESS THE SPACE BEFORE THE PRISON WAS CLEARED AND A FEW STRONG BARRIERS PAINTED BLACK HAD BEEN ALREADY THROWN ACROSS THE ROAD TO BREAK THE PRESSURE OF THE EXPECTED CROWD WHEN MR BROWNLOW AND OLIVER APPEARED AT THE WICKET AND PRESENTED AN ORDER OF ADMISSION TO THE PRISONER SIGNED BY ONE OF THE SHERIFFS THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY ADMITTED INTO THE LODGE IS THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN TO COME TOO SIR SAID THE MAN WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO CONDUCT THEM ITS NOT A SIGHT FOR CHILDREN SIR IT IS NOT INDEED MY FRIEND REJOINED MR BROWNLOW BUT MY BUSINESS WITH THIS MAN IS INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH HIM AND AS THIS CHILD HAS SEEN HIM IN THE FULL CAREER OF HIS SUCCESS AND VILLAINY I THINK IT AS WELLEVEN AT THE COST OF SOME PAIN AND FEARTHAT HE SHOULD SEE HIM NOW THESE FEW WORDS HAD BEEN SAID APART SO AS TO BE INAUDIBLE TO OLIVER THE MAN TOUCHED HIS HAT AND GLANCING AT OLIVER WITH SOME CURIOUSITY OPENED ANOTHER GATE OPPOSITE TO THAT BY WHICH THEY HAD ENTERED AND LED THEM ON THROUGH DARK AND WINDING WAYS TOWARDS THE CELLS THIS SAID THE MAN STOPPING IN A GLOOMY PASSAGE WHERE A COUPLE OF WORKMEN WERE MAKING SOME PREPARATIONS IN PROFOUND SILENCETHIS IS THE PLACE HE PASSES THROUGH IF YOU STEP THIS WAY YOU CAN SEE THE DOOR HE GOES OUT AT HE LED THEM INTO A STONE KITCHEN FITTED WITH COPPERS FOR DRESSING THE PRISON FOOD AND POINTED TO A DOOR THERE WAS AN OPEN GRATING ABOVE IT THROUGH WHICH CAME THE SOUND OF MENS VOICES MINGLED WITH THE NOISE OF HAMMERING AND THE THROWING DOWN OF BOARDS THEY WERE PUTTING UP THE SCAFFOLD FROM THIS PLACE THEY PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL STRONG GATES OPENED BY OTHER TURNKEYS FROM THE INNER SIDE AND HAVING ENTERED AN OPEN YARD ASCENDED A FLIGHT OF NARROW STEPS AND CAME INTO A PASSAGE WITH A ROW OF STRONG DOORS ON THE LEFT HAND MOTIONING THEM TO REMAIN WHERE THEY WERE THE TURNKEY KNOCKED AT ONE OF THESE WITH HIS BUNCH OF KEYS THE TWO ATTENDANTS AFTER A LITTLE WHISPERING CAME OUT INTO THE PASSAGE STRETCHING THEMSELVES AS IF GLAD OF THE TEMPORARY RELIEF AND MOTIONED THE VISITORS TO FOLLOW THE JAILER INTO THE CELL THEY DID SO THE CONDEMNED CRIMINAL WAS SEATED ON HIS BED ROCKING HIMSELF

THE MEN LAID HANDS UPON HIM AND DISENGAGING OLIVER FROM HIS GRASP HELD HIM BACK HE STRUGGLED WITH THE POWER OF DESPERATION FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN SENT UP CRY UPON CRY THAT PENETRATED EVEN THOSE MASSIVE WALLS AND RANG IN THEIR EARS UNTIL THEY REACHED THE OPEN YARD IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY LEFT THE PRISON OLIVER NEARLY SWOONED AFTER THIS FRIGHTFUL SCENE AND WAS SO WEAK THAT FOR AN HOUR OR MORE HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO WALK DAY WAS DAWNING WHEN THEY AGAIN EMERGED A GREAT MULTITUDE HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED THE WINDOWS WERE FILLED WITH PEOPLE SMOKING AND PLAYING CARDS TO BEGUILE THE TIME THE CROWD WERE PUSHING QUARRELLING JOKING EVERYTHING TOLD OF LIFE AND ANIMATION BUT ONE DARK CLUSTER OF OBJECTS IN THE CENTRE OF ALLTHE BLACK STAGE THE CROSSBEAM THE ROPE AND ALL THE HIDEOUS APPARATUS OF DEATH CHAPTER LIII AND LAST THE FORTUNES OF THOSE WHO HAVE FIGURED IN THIS TALE ARE NEARLY CLOSED THE LITTLE THAT REMAINS TO THEIR HISTORIAN TO RELATE IS TOLD IN FEW AND SIMPLE WORDS BEFORE THREE MONTHS HAD PASSED ROSE FLEMING AND HARRY MAYLIE WERE MARRIED IN THE VILLAGE CHURCH WHICH WAS HENCEFORTH TO BE THE SCENE OF THE YOUNG CLERGYMANS LABOURS ON THE SAME DAY THEY ENTERED INTO POSSESSION OF THEIR NEW AND HAPPY HOME MRS MAYLIE TOOK UP HER ABODE WITH HER SON AND DAUGHTERINLAW TO ENJOY DURING THE TRANQUIL REMAINDER OF HER DAYS THE GREATEST FELICITY THAT AGE AND WORTH CAN KNOWTHE CONTEMPLATION OF THE HAPPINESS OF THOSE ON WHOM THE WARMEST AFFECTIONS AND TENDEREST CARES OF A WELLSPENT LIFE HAVE BEEN UNCEASINGLY BESTOWED IT APPEARED ON FULL AND CAREFUL INVESTIGATION THAT IF THE WRECK OF PROPERTY REMAINING IN THE CUSTODY OF MONKS WHICH HAD NEVER PROSPERED EITHER IN HIS HANDS OR IN THOSE OF HIS MOTHER WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OLIVER IT WOULD YIELD TO EACH LITTLE MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND POUNDS BY THE PROVISIONS OF HIS FATHERS WILL OLIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTITLED TO THE WHOLE BUT MR BROWNLOW UNWILLING TO DEPRIVE THE ELDER SON OF THE OPPORTUNITY OF RETRIEVING HIS FORMER VICES AND PURSUING AN HONEST CAREER PROPOSED THIS MODE OF DISTRIBUTION TO WHICH HIS YOUNG CHARGE JOYFULLY ACCEDED MONKS STILL BEARING THAT ASSUMED NAME RETIRED WITH HIS PORTION TO A DISTANT PART OF THE NEW WORLD WHERE HAVING QUICKLY SQUANDERED IT HE ONCE MORE FELL INTO HIS OLD COURSES AND AFTER UNDERGOING A LONG CONFINEMENT FOR SOME FRESH ACT OF FRAUD AND KNAVERY AT LENGTH SUNK UNDER AN ATTACK OF HIS OLD DISORDER AND DIED IN PRISON AS FAR FROM HOME DIED THE CHIEF REMAINING MEMBERS OF HIS FRIEND FAGINS GANG MR BROWNLOW ADOPTED OLIVER AS HIS SON REMOVING WITH HIM AND THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER TO WITHIN A MILE OF THE PARSONAGEHOUSE WHERE HIS DEAR FRIENDS RESIDED HE GRATIFIED THE ONLY REMAINING WISH OF OLIVERS WARM AND EARNEST HEART AND THUS LINKED TOGETHER A LITTLE SOCIETY WHOSE CONDITION APPROACHED AS NEARLY TO ONE OF PERFECT HAPPINESS AS CAN EVER BE KNOWN IN THIS CHANGING WORLD SOON AFTER THE MARRIAGE OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THE WORTHY DOCTOR RETURNED TO CHERTSEY WHERE BEREFT OF THE PRESENCE OF HIS OLD FRIENDS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCONTENTED IF HIS TEMPERAMENT HAD ADMITTED OF SUCH A FEELING AND WOULD HAVE TURNED QUITE PEEVISH IF HE HAD KNOWN HOW FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH HINTING THAT HE FEARED THE AIR BEGAN TO DISAGREE WITH HIM THEN FINDING THAT THE PLACE REALLY NO LONGER WAS TO HIM WHAT IT HAD BEEN HE SETTLED HIS BUSINESS ON HIS ASSISTANT TOOK A BACHELORS COTTAGE OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE OF WHICH HIS YOUNG FRIEND WAS PASTOR AND INSTANTANEOUSLY RECOVERED HERE HE TOOK TO GARDENING PLANTING FISHING CARPENTERING AND VARIOUS OTHER PURSUITS OF A SIMILAR KIND ALL UNDERTAKEN WITH HIS CHARACTERISTIC IMPETUOSITY IN EACH AND ALL HE HAS SINCE BECOME FAMOUS THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS A MOST PROFOUND AUTHORITY BEFORE HIS REMOVAL HE HAD MANAGED TO CONTRACT A STRONG FRIENDSHIP FOR MR GRIMWIG WHICH THAT ECCENTRIC GENTLEMAN CORDIALLY RECIPROCATED HE IS ACCORDINGLY VISITED BY MR GRIMWIG A GREAT MANY TIMES IN THE COURSE OF THE YEAR ON ALL SUCH OCCASIONS MR GRIMWIG PLANTS FISHES AND CARPENTERS WITH GREAT ARDOUR DOING EVERYTHING IN A VERY SINGULAR AND UNPRECEDENTED MANNER BUT ALWAYS MAINTAINING WITH HIS FAVOURITE ASSEVERATION THAT HIS MODE IS THE RIGHT ONE ON SUNDAYS HE NEVER FAILS TO CRITICISE THE SERMON TO THE YOUNG CLERGYMANS FACE ALWAYS INFORMING MR LOSBERNE IN STRICT CONFIDENCE AFTERWARDS THAT HE CONSIDERS IT AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE BUT DEEMS IT AS WELL NOT TO SAY SO IT IS A STANDING AND VERY FAVOURITE JOKE FOR MR BROWNLOW TO RALLY HIM ON HIS OLD PROPHECY CONCERNING OLIVER AND TO REMIND HIM OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THEY SAT WITH THE WATCH BETWEEN THEM WAITING HIS RETURN BUT MR GRIMWIG CONTENDS THAT HE WAS RIGHT IN THE MAIN AND IN PROOF THEREOF REMARKS THAT OLIVER DID NOT COME BACK AFTER ALL WHICH ALWAYS CALLS FORTH A LAUGH ON HIS SIDE AND INCREASES HIS GOOD HUMOUR MR NOAH CLAYPOLE RECEIVING A FREE PARDON FROM THE CROWN IN CONSEQUENCE OF BEING ADMITTED APPROVER AGAINST FAGIN AND CONSIDERING HIS PROFESSION NOT ALTOGETHER AS SAFE A ONE AS HE COULD WISH WAS FOR SOME LITTLE TIME AT A LOSS FOR THE MEANS OF A LIVELIHOOD NOT BURDENED WITH TOO MUCH WORK AFTER SOME CONSIDERATION HE WENT INTO BUSINESS AS AN INFORMER IN WHICH CALLING HE REALISES A GENTEEL SUBSISTENCE HIS PLAN IS TO WALK OUT ONCE A WEEK DURING CHURCH TIME ATTENDED BY CHARLOTTE IN RESPECTABLE ATTIRE THE LADY FAINTS AWAY AT THE DOORS OF CHARITABLE PUBLICANS AND THE GENTLEMAN BEING ACCOMMODATED WITH THREEPENNY WORTH OF BRANDY TO RESTORE HER LAYS AN INFORMATION NEXT DAY AND POCKETS HALF THE PENALTY SOMETIMES MR CLAYPOLE FAINTS HIMSELF BUT THE RESULT IS THE SAME MR AND MRS BUMBLE DEPRIVED OF THEIR SITUATIONS WERE GRADUALLY REDUCED TO GREAT INDIGENCE AND MISERY AND FINALLY BECAME PAUPERS IN THAT VERY SAME WORKHOUSE IN WHICH THEY HAD ONCE LORDED IT OVER OTHERS MR BUMBLE HAS BEEN HEARD TO SAY THAT IN THIS REVERSE AND DEGRADATION HE HAS NOT EVEN SPIRITS TO BE THANKFUL FOR BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE AS TO MR GILES AND BRITTLES THEY STILL REMAIN IN THEIR OLD POSTS ALTHOUGH THE FORMER IS BALD AND THE LASTNAMED BOY QUITE GREY THEY SLEEP AT THE PARSONAGE BUT DIVIDE THEIR ATTENTIONS SO EQUALLY AMONG ITS INMATES AND OLIVER AND MR BROWNLOW AND MR LOSBERNE THAT TO THIS DAY THE VILLAGERS HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER TO WHICH ESTABLISHMENT THEY PROPERLY BELONG MASTER CHARLES BATES APPALLED BY SIKESS CRIME FELL INTO A TRAIN OF REFLECTION WHETHER AN HONEST LIFE WAS NOT AFTER ALL THE BEST ARRIVING AT THE CONCLUSION THAT IT CERTAINLY WAS HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE SCENES OF THE PAST RESOLVED TO AMEND IT IN SOME NEW SPHERE OF ACTION HE STRUGGLED HARD AND SUFFERED MUCH FOR SOME TIME BUT HAVING A CONTENTED DISPOSITION AND A GOOD PURPOSE SUCCEEDED IN THE END AND FROM BEING A FARMERS DRUDGE AND A CARRIERS LAD HE IS NOW THE MERRIEST YOUNG GRAZIER IN ALL NORTHAMPTONSHIRE AND NOW THE HAND THAT TRACES THESE WORDS FALTERS AS IT APPROACHES THE CONCLUSION OF ITS TASK AND WOULD WEAVE FOR A LITTLE LONGER SPACE THE THREAD OF THESE ADVENTURES I WOULD FAIN LINGER YET WITH A FEW OF THOSE AMONG WHOM I HAVE SO LONG MOVED AND SHARE THEIR HAPPINESS BY ENDEAVOURING TO DEPICT IT I WOULD SHOW ROSE MAYLIE IN ALL THE BLOOM AND GRACE OF EARLY WOMANHOOD SHEDDING ON HER SECLUDED PATH IN LIFE SOFT AND GENTLE LIGHT THAT FELL ON ALL WHO TROD IT WITH HER AND SHONE INTO THEIR HEARTS I WOULD PAINT HER THE LIFE AND JOY OF THE FIRESIDE CIRCLE AND THE LIVELY SUMMER GROUP I WOULD FOLLOW HER THROUGH THE SULTRY FIELDS AT NOON AND HEAR THE LOW TONES OF HER SWEET VOICE IN THE MOONLIT EVENING WALK I WOULD WATCH HER IN ALL HER GOODNESS AND CHARITY ABROAD AND THE SMILING UNTIRING DISCHARGE OF DOMESTIC DUTIES AT HOME I WOULD PAINT HER AND HER DEAD SISTERS CHILD HAPPY IN THEIR LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER AND PASSING WHOLE HOURS TOGETHER IN PICTURING THE FRIENDS WHOM THEY HAD SO SADLY LOST I WOULD SUMMON BEFORE ME ONCE AGAIN THOSE JOYOUS LITTLE FACES THAT CLUSTERED ROUND HER KNEE AND LISTEN TO THEIR MERRY PRATTLE I WOULD RECALL THE TONES OF THAT CLEAR LAUGH AND CONJURE UP THE SYMPATHISING TEAR THAT GLISTENED IN THE SOFT BLUE EYE THESE AND A THOUSAND LOOKS AND SMILES AND TURNS OF THOUGHT AND SPEECHI WOULD FAIN RECALL THEM EVERY ONE HOW MR BROWNLOW WENT ON FROM DAY TO DAY FILLING THE MIND OF HIS ADOPTED CHILD WITH STORES OF KNOWLEDGE AND BECOMING ATTACHED TO HIM MORE AND MORE AS HIS NATURE DEVELOPED ITSELF AND SHOWED THE THRIVING SEEDS OF ALL HE WISHED HIM TO BECOMEHOW HE TRACED IN HIM NEW TRAITS OF HIS EARLY FRIEND THAT AWAKENED IN HIS OWN BOSOM OLD REMEMBRANCES MELANCHOLY AND YET SWEET AND SOOTHINGHOW THE TWO ORPHANS TRIED BY ADVERSITY REMEMBERED ITS LESSONS IN MERCY TO OTHERS AND MUTUAL LOVE AND FERVENT THANKS TO HIM WHO HAD PROTECTED AND PRESERVED THEMTHESE ARE ALL MATTERS WHICH NEED NOT TO BE TOLD I HAVE SAID THAT THEY WERE TRULY HAPPY AND WITHOUT STRONG AFFECTION AND HUMANITY OF HEART AND GRATITUDE TO THAT BEING WHOSE CODE IS MERCY AND WHOSE GREAT ATTRIBUTE IS BENEVOLENCE TO ALL THINGS THAT BREATHE HAPPINESS CAN NEVER BE ATTAINED WITHIN THE ALTAR OF THE OLD VILLAGE CHURCH THERE STANDS A WHITE MARBLE TABLET WHICH BEARS AS YET BUT ONE WORD AGNES THERE IS NO COFFIN IN THAT TOMB AND MAY IT BE MANY MANY YEARS BEFORE ANOTHER NAME IS PLACED ABOVE IT BUT IF THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD EVER COME BACK TO EARTH TO VISIT SPOTS HALLOWED BY THE LOVETHE LOVE BEYOND THE GRAVEOF THOSE WHOM THEY KNEW IN LIFE I BELIEVE THAT THE SHADE OF AGNES SOMETIMES HOVERS ROUND THAT SOLEMN NOOK I BELIEVE IT NONE THE LESS BECAUSE THAT NOOK IS IN A CHURCH AND SHE WAS WEAK AND ERRING END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF OLIVER TWIST BY
