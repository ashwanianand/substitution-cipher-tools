INCLUDING THE SCANDINAVIAN TO H G WELLS THE NEXT MOST HOPEFUL INTRODUCTION THE THOUGHT OF THE TIME HAS FAMILIARISED US WITH THE EVOLUTIONARY VIEW OF THINGS WE UNDERSTAND THAT LIFE IS THE PRODUCT OF AN INNER IMPULSE LABOURING TO EMBODY ITSELF IN THE WORLD OF SENSE AND THAT THE PRODUCT IS ALWAYS CHANGINGTHAT THERE IS NOTHING PERMANENT SAVE THE PRINCIPLES AND LAWS IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHICH DEVELOPMENT GOES ON WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE UNIVERSE OF THINGS WAS EVOLVED BY SLOW STAGES INTO WHAT IT IS TODAY THAT ALL LIFE HAS COME INTO BEING IN THE SAME WAY WE HAVE TRACED THIS PROCESS IN THE FARDISTANT SUNS AND IN THE STRATA OF THE EARTH WE HAVE TRACED IT IN THE VEGETABLES AND IN THE ANIMALS IN THE SEED AND IN THE EMBRYO WE HAVE TRACED IT IN ALL OF MANS ACTIVITIES HIS WAYS OF THINKING AND ACTING OF EATING AND DRESSING AND WORKING AND FIGHTING AND PRAYING THIS BOOK IS AN ATTEMPT TO INTERPRET IN THE LIGHT OF EVOLUTIONARY SCIENCE THE SOCIAL PROBLEM OF OUR PRESENT WORLD TO CONSIDER AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS AS THEY EXIST AT THIS HOURWHAT FORCES ARE NOW AT WORK WITHIN THEM AND WHAT CHANGES THEY ARE LIKELY TO PRODUCE THE SUBJECTMATTER DEALT WITH IS NOT ABSTRACT SPECULATION BUT RATHER THE EVERYDAY REALITIES OF THE WORLD WE KNOWOUR PRESENT POLITICAL PARTIES AND PUBLIC MEN OUR PRESENT CORPORATIONS AND CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY OUR PRESENT LABOUR UNIONS AND NEWSPAPERS COLLEGES AND CHURCHES THE THING SOUGHT IS AN ANSWER TO A CONCRETE AND DEFINITE QUESTION WHAT WILL AMERICA BE TEN YEARS FROM NOW INASMUCH AS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST INTERESTED IN PRACTICAL AFFAIRS ARE VERY BUSY PEOPLE I JUDGE IT TO BE A COMMONSENSE PROCEDURE TO SET FORTH MY IDEAS IN MINIATURE AT THE OUTSET SO THAT ONE MAY LEARN IN TWO OR THREE MINUTES EXACTLY WHAT MY BOOK CONTAINS AND JUDGE WHETHER HE CARES TO READ IT IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE STUDENT OF A GENERATION FROM NOW WILL LOOK BACK UPON THE LAST TWO CENTURIES OF HUMAN HISTORY AND INTERPRET THEM AS THE FINAL STAGE OF A LONG PROCESS WHEREBY MAN WAS TRANSFORMED FROM A SOLITARY AND PREDATORY INDIVIDUAL TO A SOCIAL AND PEACEABLE MEMBER OF A SINGLE WORLD COMMUNITY HE WILL SEE THAT MEN PRESSED BY THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE HAD UNITED THEMSELVES INTO GROUPS UNDER THE DISCIPLINE OF LAWS AND CONVENTIONS AND THAT THE LAST TWO CENTURIES REPRESENTED THE PERIOD WHEN THESE LAWS AND CONVENTIONS HAVING DONE THEIR UNIFYING WORK AND SECURED THE SURVIVAL OF THE GROUP WERE SET ASIDE AND REPLACED BY FREE AND VOLUNTARY SOCIAL EFFORT THE STUDENT WILL FURTHERMORE PERCEIVE THAT THIS EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS HAD TWO MANIFESTATIONS TWO WAVES SO TO SPEAK THE FIRST POLITICAL AND THE SECOND INDUSTRIAL THE FIRST DETERMINED BY MANS STRUGGLE TO PROTECT HIS LIFE AND THE SECOND BY HIS STRUGGLE TO AMASS WEALTH THE CULMINATION OF THE FIRST OCCURRED SUCCESSIVELY IN THE ENGLISH REVOLUTIONS THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH REVOLUTIONS AND THE OTHER VARIOUS EFFORTS AFTER POLITICAL FREEDOM AFTER EACH OF THESE ACHIEVEMENTS THE HISTORIAN NOTICES A PERIOD OF BITTERNESS AND DISILLUSIONMENT A SENSE OF FAILURE IT BEING DISCOVERED THAT THE EXPECTED DID NOT OCCUR THAT LIBERTY EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY DID NOT BECOME THE RULE OF MENS CONDUCT AFTER THAT HOWEVER SUCCEEDS A PERIOD OF ENLIGHTENMENT IT HAVING BEEN REALISED THAT THE WORK HAS ONLY BEEN HALF DONE THAT MAN HAS BEEN MADE ONLY HALF FREE THE POLITICAL SOVEREIGNTY HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE POSSESSION OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AND MADE THE PROPERTY OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY TO BE SHARED IN BY ALL UPON EQUAL TERMS BUT THE INDUSTRIAL SOVEREIGNTY STILL REMAINS THE PROPERTY OF A FEW A MAN CAN NO LONGER BE PUT IN JAIL OR TAXED BY A KING BUT HE CAN BE STARVED AND EXPLOITED BY A MASTER HIS BODY IS NOW HIS OWN BUT HIS LABOUR IS ANOTHERSAND THERE IS VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SO IMMEDIATELY THERE BEGINS A NEW MOVEMENT THE END OF WHICH IS A NEW REVOLUTION AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC WHAT DO I MEAN BY AN INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC I MEAN AN ORGANISATION FOR THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH WHOSE MEMBERS ARE ESTABLISHED UPON A BASIS OF EQUALITY WHO ELECT REPRESENTATIVES TO GOVERN THE ORGANISATION AND WHO RECEIVE THE FULL VALUE OF WHAT THEIR LABOUR PRODUCES I MEAN AN INDUSTRIAL GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE A COMMUNITY IN WHICH THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION HAVE BEEN MADE THE INALIENABLE PROPERTY OF THE STATE MY PURPOSE IN WRITING THIS BOOK IS TO POINT OUT THE FORCES WHICH ARE NOW RAPIDLY DEVELOPING IN AMERICA AND WHICH WHEN THEY HAVE ATTAINED TO MATURITY WILL USHER IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC BY A PROCESS AS NATURAL AND AS INEVITABLE AS THAT BY WHICH A CHICK BREAKS OUT OF ITS SHELL OR A CHILD COMES FORTH FROM THE WOMB AT THE PROPER HOUR I BELIEVE THAT THE ECONOMIC PROCESS IS WHIRLING US ON WITH TERRIFIC MOMENTUM TOWARD THE CRISIS AND I LOOK TO SEE THE MOST ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION ACCOMPLISHED IN AMERICA WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF IF I HAD BEEN A TACTFUL PERSON I SHOULD HAVE KEPT THAT LAST STATEMENT UNTIL FAR ON IN MY ARGUMENT FOR I FIND MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE IDEA OF AN INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC AND SOME FEW WHO ARE WILLING TO THINK OF IT AS A POSSIBILITY BUT I FIND NONE WHO DO NOT BALK WHEN I PRESUME TO SET THE DAY YET THE SETTING OF THE DAY IS A VITAL PART OF MY CONVICTION AND I SHOULD PLAY THE READER FALSE IF I FAILED TO MENTION IT IN THIS PRELIMINARY STATEMENT OF MY ARGUMENT IT IS A CONVICTION TO WHICH I HAVE COME WITH THE DILIGENT USE OF THE BEST FACULTIES I POSSESS AND AFTER A PREPARATION OF A SORT THAT IS CERTAINLY UNUSUAL AND POSSIBLY EVEN QUITE UNIQUE PERHAPS I CANNOT DO BETTER BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION THAN TO EXPLAIN JUST WHAT I MEAN OUR COUNTRY HAS PASSED THROUGH TWO GREAT CRISES WHEN IMPORTANT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CHANGES CAME WITH STARTLING SUDDENNESS I REFER TO THE REVOLUTION AND THE CIVIL WAR AND TO THE LATTER OF THESE CRISES OR RATHER THE PERIOD OF ITS PREPARATION TO I ONCE HAD OCCASION TO GIVE TWO YEARS OF AN INTERESTING KIND OF STUDY I READ EVERYTHING WHICH I COULD FIND IN THE TWO LARGEST SPECIAL COLLECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY NOT MERELY HISTORIES AND BIOGRAPHIES BUT THE DOCUMENTS OF THE TIME SPEECHES AND SERMONS AND LETTERS NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES AND PAMPHLETS I LITERALLY LIVED IN THE PERIOD I KNEW IT MORE INTIMATELY THAN THE WORLD THAT WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT ME MY PURPOSE WAS TO WRITE A NOVEL WHICH SHOULD MAKE THE CRISIS REAL TO THE PEOPLE OF THE PRESENT AND SO I HAD TO READ CREATIVELY I HAD TO GET INTO THE VERY SOUL OF WHAT I READ I HAD TO STRUGGLE AND TO SUFFER WITH THE PEOPLE OF THAT TIME TO FORGET MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE AND TO WATCH THROUGH THEIR EYES THE HOURLY UNFOLDING OF THE MIGHTY DRAMA OF EVENTS THERE WERE SO MANY KINDS OF MENSTATESMEN AND BUSINESS MEN LAWYERS AND CLERGYMEN HEROES AND COWARDS AND I HAD TO STUDY THEM ALL AND SEE THE THING THROUGH THE EYES OF EACH OF THEM AND OF COURSE I COULD ONLY PLAY AT IGNORANCE FOR I KNEW THE FUTURE AND I SAW ALL THEIR MISTAKES AND THE REASONS FOR THEM AND THE PITY AND THE FOLLY AND THE TRAGEDY OF IT ALL KNOWING AS I DID THE GREAT UNDERLYING FORCES WHICH WERE DRIVING BEHIND THE EVENTS I SAW ALL THESE PEOPLE AS PUPPETS MOVED HERE AND THERE BY POWERS OF WHOSE EXISTENCE THEY NEVER DREAMED AND OF COURSE ALL THE WHILE I WAS ALSO READING MY MORNING NEWSPAPER AND WATCHING THE WORLD OF TODAY AND INEVITABLY I FOUND MYSELF TESTING THE PEOPLE OF THE PRESENT BY THESE SAME METHODS I WOULD FIND MYSELF SEEKING FOR THE FORCES WHICH WERE AT WORK TODAY AND STRIVING TO REACH OUT TO THE FUTURE TO WHICH THEY WERE LEADING I WOULD FIND MYSELF BY THE WAY OF HELPING IN THIS INTERPRETATION COMPARING AND BALANCING THE TWO ERAS AND TRANSPOSING ITS FIGURES BACK AND FORTH THIS FAMOUS EDUCATOR OR THIS NEWSPAPER EDITOR OF TODAYWHAT WOULD HE HAVE BEEN SAYING HAD HE LIVED IN AND THIS CLERGYMAN FRIEND OF MINE THIS POLITICIANWHERE WOULD HE FIT INTO THAT PERIOD OR IF YANCEY HAD BEEN ALIVE TODAY WHAT WOULD HE HAVE BEEN DOING WHERE SHOULD I HAVE FOUND SEWARDWHAT PARTS WOULD EDWARD EVERETT AND WENDELL PHILLIPS AND JEFFERSON DAVIS HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT WAS REALLY A FASCINATING PROBLEM IN PROPORTION THE MEN OF FIFTY YEARS AGO STOOD THUS AND SO TO A KNOWN CRISIS SIMILAR MEN OF THE PRESENT STAND THUS TO AN UNKNOWN CRISISAND NOW FIND THE CRISIS WHEN I HAD FINISHED MANASSAS I TOOK UP THE WRITING OF THE JUNGLE WHICH IS SIMPLY TO SAY THAT I WAS DRAWN ON IRRESISTIBLY TO SEEK FOR THIS LATTER CRISIS AND TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND ITTO GET INTO THE HEART OF IT AND LIVE IT AND FOLLOW IT TO ITS END JUST AS I HAD DONE WITH THE EARLIER ONE SO NOW I FEEL THAT I HAVE MUCH THE SAME SORT OF POWER AS CUVIER THE NATURALIST WHO COULD CONSTRUCT A PREHISTORIC ANIMAL FROM A BIT OF ITS BONE I HAVE FAR MORE THAN THE BONE OF THIS MONSTERI HAVE HIS TAIL BEGINNING FAR BACK IN THE SEVENTIES AND I HAVE THE WHOLE OF HIS HUGE BODYTHE PRESENT I HAVE COUNTED HIS SCALES AND MEASURED HIS LIMBS I HAVE EVEN FELT HIS PULSE AND HAD HIS BLOOD UNDER THE MICROSCOPE AND NOW YOU ASK MEHOW MANY MORE VERTEBR WILL THERE BE IN THE NECK OF THIS STRANGE ANIMAL AND WHAT WILL BE THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE OF HIS HEAD SO IT IS THAT I WRITE IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THAT THE REVOLUTION WILL TAKE PLACE IN AMERICA WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF AND IN SAYING THIS I CLAIM TO SPEAK NOT AS A DREAMER NOR AS A CHILD BUT AS A SCIENTIST AND A PROPHET CONTENTS PAGE INTRODUCTION VII CHAPTER I THE COMING CRISIS II INDUSTRIAL EVOLUTION III

VS COPERATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION HELICON HALL THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC CHAPTER I THE COMING CRISIS THE THING WHICH MOST IMPRESSES THE STUDENT OF THE CIVIL WAR STRUGGLE IS HOW GENERALLY AND COMPLETELY THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED THROUGH IT FAILED TO UNDERSTAND IT THEMSELVES WE OF THE PRESENT DAY KNOW THAT THE WAR WAS A CLASH BETWEEN TWO INCOMPATIBLE TYPES OF CIVILISATION BETWEEN AN AGRICULTURAL AND CONSERVATIVE ARISTOCRACY AND A COMMERCIAL AND PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRACY WE CAN SEE THAT EACH SOCIETY DEVELOPED IN ITS PEOPLE A SEPARATE POINT OF VIEW SEPARATE CUSTOMS AND LAWS IDEALS AND POLICIES LITERATURES AND RELIGIONS WE CAN SEE THAT THEIR DIFFERING INTERESTS AS TO TARIFFS POLICE REGULATIONS DOMESTIC IMPROVEMENTS AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS MADE POLITICAL STRIFE BETWEEN THEM INEVITABLE AND THAT FINALLY THE EXPANSION WHICH WAS NECESSARY TO THE LIFE OF EACH BROUGHT THEM INTO A CONFLICT WHICH COULD ONLY END WITH THE SUBMISSION OF ONE OR THE OTHER YET PLAIN AS THIS SEEMS TO US NOW THE PEOPLE OF THAT TIME DID NOT GRASP IT THROUGH THE WHOLE LONG PROCESS THEY WERE DRAGGED AS IT WERE BY THE HAIR OF THEIR HEADS AND EACH EVENT AS IT CAME WAS A SEPARATE PHENOMENON A FRESH SOURCE OF ASTONISHMENT ALARM AND INDIGNATION EVEN AFTER THE WAR HAD BROKEN OUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM WOULD NOT BE ENLIGHTENED AS IN REGARD TO ITA FEW OF THEM HAVE NOT BEEN ENLIGHTENED YET I TALKED RECENTLY WITH AN OLD CONFEDERATE NAVAL OFFICER WHO SAID TO ME OH YES IT WAS THE POLITICIANS WHO MADE THE WAR I RECALL THE ASTONISHED LOOK WHICH CROSSED THE OLD GENTLEMANS FACE WHEN I VENTURED THE OPINION THAT THE POLITICIANS OF THIS COUNTRY HAD NEVER YET MADE ANYTHING EXCEPT THEIR OWN LIVINGS IT SEEMED NOT MERELY THAT THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE THING THEY WOULD NOT THE TRUTH DID NOT PLEASE THEM AND THE BEST AND WISEST OF THEM APPEARED TO HAVE THE IDEA THAT THEY HAD ONLY NOT TO SEE IT AND IT WOULD CEASE TO BE THE TRUTH AFTER THE MANNER OF THE LEARNED MEN OF GALILEOS TIME WHO DECLINED TO LOOK THROUGH HIS TELESCOPE OR TO WATCH HIM DROP WEIGHTS FROM THE TOWER OF PISA THEY MADE IT A MATTER OF OFFENCE THAT ANYONE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE ABILITY TO PREDICT POLITICAL EVENTS WAS HELD TO IMPLY SOME COLLUSION WITH THEM WHEN LINCOLN JUST BEFORE THE CRASH VENTURED TO DOUBT THE STABILITY OF A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF HIS ENEMIES FELL UPON HIM PRECISELY AS IF HE HAD DECLARED NOT THAT SUCH A HOUSE WOULD FALL BUT THAT HE INTENDED TO KNOCK IT DOWN AND THIS WAS THE ESTABLISHED VIEW OF ALL THE CONSERVATISM OF THE COUNTRY ONLY TWO OR THREE YEARS BEFORE THERE BURST UPON IT ONE OF THE MOST FEARFUL CATACLYSMS OF HISTORY LET US ENDEAVOUR TO PLACE OURSELVES IN THE POSITION OF THE AVERAGE MAN OF AND SEE NOW THE WHOLE MATTER APPEARED TO HIM WAY BACK IN THE EARLY THIRTIES EIGHT OR TEN MORE OR LESS INSANE FANATICSAPOSTATE PRIESTS AND UNSEXED WOMEN AS ONE WRITER DESCRIBED THEMHAD GOT TOGETHER AND BEGUN AN AGITATION FOR A WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE AND VISIONARY TO SAY NOTHING OF REVOLUTIONARY AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMMETHE IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL EMANCIPATION OF THE SLAVES THEY FORMED A SOCIETY AND STARTED A PAPER CALLED THE LIBERATOR WHEN GOVERNORS OF SOUTHERN STATES PROTESTED CONCERNING IT THE HON HARRISON GRAY OTIS MAYOR OF BOSTON WROTE AS FOLLOWS IT APPEARED UPON INQUIRY THAT NO MEMBER OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT NOR ANY PERSON OF MY ACQUAINTANCE HAD EVER HEARD OF THE PUBLICATION SOMETIME AFTERWARD IT WAS REPORTED TO ME BY THE CITY OFFICERS THAT THEY HAD FERRETED OUT THE PAPER AND ITS EDITOR THAT HIS OFFICE WAS AN OBSCURE HOLE HIS ONLY VISIBLE AUXILIARY A NEGRO BOY AND HIS SUPPORTERS A VERY FEW IGNORANT PERSONS OF ALL COLOURS THIS INFORMATION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE ALDERMEN I COMMUNICATED TO THE ABOVE NAMED GOVERNORS WITH AN UTTERANCE OF MY BELIEF THAT THE NEW FANATICISM HAD NOT MADE NOR WAS LIKELY TO MAKE PROSELYTES AMONG THE RESPECTABLE CLASSES OF THE PEOPLE NEVERTHELESS THE DANGER OF THIS PROPAGANDA WAS RECOGNISED AND BEFORE LONG THE ABOLITIONISTS WERE BEING STONED AND SHOT THEIR PRESSES SMASHED AND THEIR MEETINGS BROKEN UP A BROADCLOTH MOB PUT A ROPE ROUND THE NECK OF THE EDITOR OF THE LIBERATOR AND DRAGGED HIM THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY AND STILL IN SPITE OF THIS THE AGITATION WENT ON ALL THE CRANKS OF THE COUNTRY GRADUALLY RALLIED ABOUT THE MOVEMENT THEIR LEADER WAS A WOMANS SUFFRAGIST AN INFIDEL A PROHIBITIONIST AND A VEGETARIAN HE DENOUNCED THE CONSTITUTION AS AN AGREEMENT WITH DEATH AND A COVENANT WITH HELL THERE WAS ONE MAN AMONG THEM WHO ADDRESSED MEETINGS WITH CLANKING CHAINS ABOUT HIS WRISTS AND A THREEPRONGED IRON SLAVECOLLAR ABOUT HIS NECK AND WHO DECLARED TO THE PEOPLE OF A TOWN THAT THEY HAD BETTER ESTABLISH AMONG THEM A HUNDRED RUMSHOPS FIFTY GAMBLINGHOUSES AND TEN BROTHELS THAN ONE CHURCH THEY ALLOWED NEGROES TO SPEAK ON THE PLATFORM WITH THEM AND THEY OPENED SCHOOLS FOR NEGRO GIRLS OR TRIED TO UNTIL THESE WERE BROKEN UP ONE OF THEM REFUSED TO PAY TAXES TO A SLAVEHOLDING GOVERNMENT AND WENT TO JAIL FOR IT ASSUREDLY NO COMMONSENSE PERSON WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HERE WAS ANYTHING SAVE A MADNESS THAT MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO RUN ITS COURSE YET THE ABOLITIONISTS KEPT AT IT IN THE ELECTION OF A WING OF THEM SPLIT OFF AND NOMINATED A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY WHO RECEIVED SEVEN THOUSAND VOTES OUT OF A TOTAL OF TWO OR THREE MILLIONS FOUR YEARS LATER WHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS ON THE VERGE OF FORCING THE COUNTRY INTO A WAR WITH MEXICO THEY RAISED A HUE AND CRY THAT THIS WAS A SLAVEDRIVERS ENTERPRISE WITH THE RESULT THAT THEIR VOTE WENT UP TO SIXTYTWO THOUSAND AND BY KEEPING UP THE CEASELESS AGITATION ALL THROUGH THE WAR AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A FACTIONAL QUARREL IN NEW YORK STATE TO NOMINATE A POLITICIAN WHO CAME INTO THEIR CAMP FOR THE SAKE OF REVENGE THEY CAST IN A VOTE OF TWO HUNDRED AND NINETYONE THOUSAND AND ALSO THEY HAD BY THIS TIME SUCCEEDED IN COLOURING A GREAT MASS OF THE POPULAR THOUGHT WITH THEIR VIEWS THEY HAD GOTTEN THE COUNTRY UNSETTLED THEY HAD MADE PEOPLE FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AND ALL SORTS OF ANTISLAVERY MEASURES WERE BEGINNING TO BE CHAMPIONED SOME WANTED TO EXCLUDE SLAVERY FROM THE NEW TERRITORIES SOME WANTED TO EXCLUDE IT FROM THE NATIONAL CAPITAL SOME WANTED TO RESTRICT THE DOMESTIC SLAVETRADE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE OF COURSE DENIED INDIGNANTLY THAT THEY WERE ABOLITIONISTS DENIED THAT THEY HAD ANY SYMPATHY WITH ABOLITIONISM OR THAT THEIR MEASURES HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT BUT THE SOUTH WHOM THE MATTER CONCERNED UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY WELL THE FOLLY OF SUCH A CLAIMUNDERSTOOD THAT THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY WAS ONE WHICH COULD NOT BE MADE WAR UPON OR LIMITED AND THAT THE FIRST HOSTILE MOVE WHICH WAS MADE AGAINST IT WOULD NECESSARILY MEAN ITS DOWNFALL HENCE TO THE SOUTH ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE ABOLITIONISTS OVER THE CALIFORNIA QUESTION THERE CAME AT LAST A CRISIS AND ALL THE CONSERVATIVE FORCES OF THE NATION WERE SCARCELY EQUAL TO THE SETTLING OF IT EDWARD EVERETT AND RUFUS CHOATE AND CALHOUN AND CLAY AND WEBSTER AND A DOZEN OTHERS THAT ONE MIGHT NAME EXERTED ALL THEIR INFLUENCE AND WENT ABOUT WARNING THEIR COUNTRYMEN OF THE DANGER AND DENOUNCING WHAT WEBSTER CALLED THE DIN AND ROLL AND RUBADUB OF ABOLITION PRESSES AND ABOLITION LECTURES UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMPROMISE WAS ADOPTED AND THE VOTE OF THE ABOLITIONIST PARTY FELL OFF TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTYSIX THOUSAND BUT THEN CAME THE REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE WHICH BROUGHT LINCOLN INTO POLITICS THE ABOLITION CLAMOUR SURGED UP AS NEVER BEFOREHERE WAS ONE PROOF THE MORE THEY SAID THAT SLAVERY WAS MENACING AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS THE WHOLE COUNTRY SEEMED SUDDENLY TO BE FULL OF THEIR SUPPORTERS AND THE KANSAS RAID ONLY ADDED MORE FUEL TO THE FLAME THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS FORMED THE BLACK REPUBLICAN PARTY AS THE SLAVEHOLDERS CALLED IT AND AT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF THEY CAST MORE THAN ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND VOTES ABOUT ONETHIRD OF THE TOTAL VOTE OF THE COUNTRY AFTER THAT CAME IN DUE COURSE THE ATTEMPT OF THE SUPREME COURT TO PUT AN END TO THE ABOLITIONIST AGITATION DECLARING THAT CONGRESS COULD NOT RESTRICT SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORIES WHICH MEANT THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAD NO RIGHT TO EXIST TO CHEERFULLY ACQUIESCE IN THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT WAS THE DUTY OF ALL GOOD CITIZENS ACCORDING TO PRESIDENT BUCHANAN YET THE ONLY RESULT OF THE ACTION OF THE SUPREME COURT WAS TO CAUSE THE AGITATION TO BURST OUT AFRESH IN ILLINOIS ABRAHAM LINCOLN RAN FOR SENATOR IN FLAT DEFIANCE OF THE SUPREME COURTS DECISION AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WENT ON IN ITS REVOLUTIONARY COURSE PRECISELY AS IF NO SUPREME COURT HAD EVER EXISTED A YEAR OR TWO LATER AN AGITATOR MADE MATTERS STILL WORSE BY HIS ATTEMPT TO SET FREE THE SLAVES BY FORCE IT IS MY FIRM AND DELIBERATE CONVICTION SAID SENATOR DOUGLAS THAT THE HARPERS FERRY CRIME WAS THE NATURAL LOGICAL AND INEVITABLE RESULT OF THE DOCTRINES AND TEACHINGS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND HE WAS PERFECTLY RIGHT IT WAS DISGRACEFUL AND YET IT WOULD NOT STOP THE NORTH HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME SO FULL OF ABOLITIONISM THAT EVEN THE DEMOCRATS WERE NOT TO BE TRUSTED WHEN THE SPLIT CAME IN CHARLESTON YANCEY OF ALABAMA EXPLAINED THIS WHEN I WAS A BOY IN THE NORTHERN STATES HE SAID ABOLITIONISTS WERE PELTED WITH ROTTEN EGGS BUT NOW THIS BAND OF ABOLITIONISTS HAS SPREAD AND GROWN INTO THREE BANDSTHE BLACK REPUBLICANS THE FREESOILERS AND THE SQUATTERSOVEREIGNTY MENALL REPRESENTING THE COMMON SENTIMENT THAT SLAVERY IS WRONG AND WHEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT BY A MINORITY OF THE PEOPLE UPON A PLATFORM WHICH DECLARED THAT THE CONSTITUTION WAS TO BE DISREGARDED THE PARTY OF CONSERVATISM AND TRADITION RESORTED TO FORCE TO MAINTAIN ITS RIGHTS AND WHAT HAPPENED THEN WHY SIMPLY THIS A GROUP OF FANATICAL VISIONARIES WHO HAD FOR THIRTY YEARS BEEN JEERED AT FOR DEMANDING OF THE COUNTRY SOMETHING THAT WAS REVOLUTIONARY AND INCONCEIVABLETHE DESTRUCTION OF AN INSTITUTION WHICH HAD STOOD FOR CENTURIES AND WAS BUILT INTO THE VERY FRAMEWORK OF THE NATIONSUDDENLY BEGAN TO SEE THE MIGHTY STRUCTURE TOTTER TO SEE CRACKS OPEN IN IT TO SEE ITS PILLARS CRUMBLE ITS ROOF FALL IN AND AT LAST BEFORE THEY HAD FAIRLY TIME TO REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE WHOLE HEAVENDEFYING COLOSSUS LAY A HEAP OF DUST AND RUINS AT THEIR FEET I HAVE SAID THAT I BELIEVE THAT OUR COUNTRY IS NOW ONLY A FEW YEARS AWAY FROM A SIMILAR GREAT TRANSFORMATION IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THAT THESIS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO SHOW FIRST A GREAT UNDERLYING ECONOMIC CAUSE WORKING IRRESISTIBLY TO FORCE THE ISSUE AND SECOND A CONSEQUENT MOVEMENT OF PROTEST SLOWLY MAKING HEADWAY AND ULTIMATELY PERMEATING THE WHOLE THOUGHT OF THE COUNTRY WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR TO PUT IT INTO A PHRASE IT WAS THE NEED UNDER WHICH SLAVERY LABOURED OF SECURING NEW TERRITORY THE READER MAY FIND A CONTEMPORARY EXPOSITION OF THE SITUATION IN OLMSTEADS COTTON KINGDOM SLAVE LABOUR WAS A VERY WASTEFUL MEANS OF CULTIVATIONONLY THE TOP OF THE SOIL WAS USED AND TEN OR FIFTEEN CROPS EXHAUSTED IT VIRGINIA WAS ONCE A GREAT EXPORTING STATE BUT IN THE FORTIES AND FIFTIES IT HAD BECOME SIMPLY A SLAVEBREEDING GROUND FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION WHICH HAD MOVED TO THE FAR SOUTH AND THEN WHEN THE FAR SOUTH BEGAN TO PROVE INSUFFICIENT THERE WAS ANOTHER MOVE INTO TEXAS AND FINALLY AN ATTEMPT AT STILL A THIRD INTO KANSASWHICH BROUGHT ON THE CLASH WITH THE FREE STATES AT THE PRESENT DAY WE HAVE A SOCIETY INDUSTRIAL INSTEAD OF AGRICULTURAL AND THE STRUGGLE WHICH WE ARE WITNESSING IS THAT BETWEEN CAPITAL AND LABOUR IT IS A STRUGGLE NOT FOR LAND BUT FOR PROFITS AND IF WE ARE TO SHOW THAT IT IS LIKE THE CIVIL WAR AN IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT BETWEEN OPPOSING AND ENDURING FORCES WE MUST SHOW IN THIS CASE ALSO THAT THE THING STRUGGLED FOR IS LIMITED IN QUANTITY AND ULTIMATELY INSUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF BOTH THE CONTENDING PARTIES THAT OUR INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM IS BASED UPON PROFITS AND THAT A FAILURE OF PROFITS WOULD LEAD TO ITS COLLAPSE WILL BE ADMITTED BY ANYONE BUT HOW COULD PROFITS EVER FAIL THE READER ASKS WILL NOT THE SOIL ALWAYS PRODUCE AND DOES NOT EVERY MAN WHO COMES INTO THE WORLD BRING A PAIR OF HANDS WITH HIM TO PRODUCE THINGS AND EARN HIS LIVING AND SO CAN THERE NOT ALWAYS BE PROFITABLE EXCHANGE THERE COULD I ANSWER PROVIDED THAT THE VARIOUS PAIRS OF HANDS WERE TO REMAIN UPON EQUAL TERMS BUT SUPPOSE THAT ONE PAIR WERE TO GET SOME ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHER PAIRS AND USE THAT ADVANTAGE TO GET CONSTANTLY INCREASING ADVANTAGE MIGHT THERE NOT THEN COME A TIME WHEN THE OTHER PAIRS HAVING LESS AND LESS WERE FINALLY UNABLE TO FURNISH AS MUCH PROFITS AS WERE NECESSARY WE BEGAN THE ECONOMIC BATTLE IN THIS COUNTRY UPON EQUAL TERMS SOME GOT THE ADVANTAGE AND BECAME MASTERS THE OTHERS BECOMING WAGEWORKERS THIS ADVANTAGETHAT IS CAPITALBROUGHT CONSTANTLY INCREASING ADVANTAGEPROFIT RENT INTEREST AND THOSE WHO HAD NOT THE ADVANTAGE STAYED MEANWHILE JUST WHERE THEY WERETHEY GOT ENOUGH TO LIVE ON AND NO MORE NUMEROUS EXCEPTIONS TO THIS DO NOT IN THE LEAST DISTURB THE MAIN FACTSTHAT AS A CLASS THE WAGEWORKERS STAYED WAGEWORKERS AND THE MASTERS STAYED MASTERS NEITHER DOES THE FACT THAT WAGES ROSE CONSTANTLY IN THE LEAST DISTURB THE MAIN FACT FOR THE COST OF LIVING ROSE ALSO THE WAGEWORKER GOT HIS LIVING THEN AND HE GETS IT NOW AND MEANWHILE ACCORDING TO THE WAY OF NATURE AND IN SPITE OF THE OUTCRY OF MORALISTS AND OLDFASHIONED STATESMEN THE STRONG WENT ON GROWING STRONGER AND FIGHTING AMONG EACH OTHER THE VICTORS GROWING TEN TIMES STRONGER YET UNTIL NOW WE HAVE COME TO A STAGE WHERE INDUSTRIALLY SPEAKING WE ARE A NATION OF EIGHTY MILLION PYGMIES AND A DOZEN GIANTS NOR IS THE WORK QUITE DONE YETIT IS GOING STRAIGHT ON IN SPITE OF ANTITRUST DECISIONS AND THE LABOUR OF THE MUCKRAKE MANAND WITHIN A VERY FEW MORE YEARS THE DOZEN GIANTS WILL BE BUT ONE GIANT THE DOZEN MEANWHILE ARE GIANTS AND THEY ARE THAT BECAUSE THE INDUSTRIAL OPPORTUNITIES OF THE NATION ARE THEIR PROPERTY THEY ARE THE NATION ECONOMICALLY SPEAKING THEY OWN ITS RAILROADS AND TELEGRAPHS ITS COAL MINES OIL FIELDS FACTORIES AND STORES AND THEY GRANT TO THE EIGHTY MILLIONS OF THE NATION THE RIGHT TO THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND A CHANCE TO EARN THEIR LIVING UPON ONE CERTAIN DEFINITE CONDITIONTHAT OF WHAT THEY PRODUCE THEY RECEIVE ONLY A PART YIELDING UP THE BALANCE TO BE PROFITS IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTICE THAT THESE PROFITS ARE NOT TAKEN IN KINDTHE PRODUCT MUST FIRST BE SOLD SO THAT BOTH WAGES AND PROFITS CAN BE PAID IN MONEY IT THUS FOLLOWS THAT THE AMOUNT OF PROFITS IS STRICTLY LIMITED BY THE AMOUNT OF MARKET THAT CAN BE FOUND IN OTHER WORDS THAT A SOCIETY WHOSE INCOME IS LIMITED IS ALSO LIMITED AS TO ITS PROFITYIELDING CAPACITYTHAT FOR INSTANCE A SOCIETY OF EIGHTY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE RECEIVING A MERE LIVING WAGE WILL BE ABLE TO YIELD JUST SO MUCH RENT INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS AND NOT ANY MORE BUT WHAT IT YIELDS HAS IN THE PAST BEEN ENOUGH SAYS THE READER WHY WILL IT NOT BE ENOUGH FOR THE FUTURE JUST THIS IS THE CRUX OF THE WHOLE MATTER RENT INTEREST DIVIDENDS IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD ARE FRACTIONS AND FRACTIONS MAY BE DECREASED AS WELL BY INCREASING THE DENOMINATOR AS BY DECREASING THE NUMERATOR A MAN FOR INSTANCE WHO INVESTED A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND MADE SIX WOULD RECEIVE SIX PER CENT INTEREST BUT IF HE INVESTED THE SECOND YEAR ONE HUNDRED AND SIX DOLLARS AND WAS ABLE STILL TO GAIN ONLY SIX HIS PROFIT WOULD BE NOT SIX PER CENT BUT ONLY FIVE AND A FRACTION IF HE WISHED TO MAKE SIX HE WOULD HAVE TO SQUEEZE OUT A LITTLE MORE THAN SIX DOLLARS WOULD HAVE TO COMPEL THE MAN WHO PAID IT TO HIM TO WORK JUST A LITTLE HARDER AND THAT IN MINIATURE IS A REPRESENTATION OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY YOU THE WELLMEANING READER WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE THE WORLD BETTER AND FAILINGWHETHER THE THING WHICH YOU ARE TRYING TO REFORM BE POLITICS OR LITERATURE OR RELIGION NEW YORK OR COLORADO OR THE PHILIPPINES FIFTH AVENUE OR WALL STREET OR HELLS KITCHENYOU ARE MEETING WITH FAILURE BECAUSE OF THAT LITTLE ARITHMETICAL DIFFICULTY WHICH HAS JUST BEEN SET FORTH CONSIDER OUR MILLIONAIRE FORTUNES HOW THEY GROW CONSIDER FOR INSTANCE THAT MR JOHN D ROCKEFELLER MAKES FIFTY PER CENT A YEAR UPON HIS HOLDINGS IN THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY THE STOCK OF THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY IS NOW AT FIVE HUNDRED AND HAS BEEN AS HIGH AS EIGHT HUNDRED IN THE MARKET THIS IS ASSUMING THAT MR ROCKEFELLER INVESTED IN THE STOCK AT PARTHOUGH AS A MATTER OF FACT HE PUT IN ONLY ABOUT TWENTY DOLLARS A SHARE WHICH WOULD MAKE HIS PROFIT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER CENT HIS INCOME IS AT LEAST FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHAT DOES HE DO WITH IT OF COURSE HE CANT SPEND ITIF HE TREATED HIMSELF TO A ST LOUIS EXPOSITION EVERY YEAR HE COULDNT SPEND IT WHAT HE DOES WITH IT IS TO TAKE IT PROMPTLY AND REINVEST IT IN THE FORM OF NEW CAPITAL HE EMPLOYS A STAFF OF THIRTYTWO TRAINED EXPERTS TO AID HIM IN THIS WORK THE EFFECT OF THIS IS OF COURSE TO MAKE HIS INCOME FIFTY PER CENT COMPOUND INTEREST INSTEAD OF SIMPLE AND WHAT IT WILL BE IN THE COURSE OF TIME IS A PROBLEM FOR THOSE WHO LIKE FIGURES WHILE HE IS DOING THIS ALL THE OTHER CAPITALISTS ARE DOING THE SAMETHE AMERICAN MILLIONAIRE LETS HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS SPEND AS MUCH OF HIS MONEY AS THEY CAN BUT HE SELDOM SPENDS ANY HIMSELF HE IS MORE INTERESTED IN DOING THINGS THE CONSEQUENCE IS THEREFORE THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR WE ARE PAYING THE VAST MASS OF OUR PEOPLE MERE LIVING WAGES AND ALL THE SURPLUS PRODUCT OF OUR TOIL WE ARE SELLING AND DEVOTING TO THE CREATION OF NEW INSTRUMENTS OF PRODUCTION WE HAVE MARK YOU MACHINERY THAT CREATES PRODUCTS FOR HUNDREDS OF TIMES AS MANY MEN AS IT EMPLOYS AND STILL WE SKIM OFF THE SURPLUS AND DEVOTE IT TO MAKING NEW MACHINES IS IT NOT OBVIOUS THAT THIS CANNOT GO ON FOREVER AND THAT THE TIME MUST COME THAT WE MAKE ALL THAT WE NEEDOR RATHER THAT OUR PEOPLE HAVE MONEY TO BUY WAGES BEING WHAT THEY ARE AND IF THAT EVER HAPPENS THEN OF COURSE THE FACTORIES WILL HAVE TO SHUT DOWN WE SHALL HAVE MILLIONS OF MEN OUT OF WORK AND STARVING ON OUR STREETS AND WHEN THEY FORM PROCESSIONS AND BEGIN AGITATING DEMANDING THAT WE GIVE THEM WORK THEN WE SAYTHAT IS OUR NEWSPAPERS OUR PREACHERS OUR POLITICIANS EVERYBODY SAYS BUT MY GOOD MAN THERE IS NO MORE WORK TO BE DONE BUT I AM STARVING INSISTS THE WORKINGMAN WE ARE ALL STARVING WHY IS THERE NO WORK THE REASON THERE IS NO WORK IS OVERPRODUCTION THE MARKET IS CLOGGED WITH PRODUCTS YOU MUST UNDERSTAND AND WE CANT SELL THEM WHAT IS YOUR TRADE I WORK IN A SHOEFACTORY BUT THE SHOE MARKET IS ALREADY GLUTTEDTHERE ARE TWICE AS MANY SHOES AS THERE IS ANY USE FOR TWICE AS MANY SHOES BUT MY FEET ARE ON THE GROUND WELL WE CANT HELP THAT MY GOOD MAN THATS BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO MONEY TO BUY THEM WITH AND MY FRIEND HERE GOES ON THE WORKINGMANHE IS A TAILOR AND HE IS NAKED BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY COATS ON THE MARKET EXACTLY AND THE BAKER HERE IS STARVING BECAUSE WE ARE BOTH TOO POOR TO BUY HIS BREAD EXACTLY AND THEN THIS DRUGGIST IS SICK BECAUSE WE HAVE NO MONEY TO BUY MEDICINE EXACTLY AFTER WHICH THE WORKINGMAN STANDS AND SCRATCHES HIS HEAD FOR A MOMENT THERE IS TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING HE REFLECTS THERE IS NO MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND SUDDENLY THE LIGHT BREAKS OH I SEE HE CRIES WE HAVE FINISHED OUR WORK FOR THE CAPITALISTS AND YOU ANSWER EXACTLY EVERYTHING IS COMPLETE AND OF COURSE THERE IS NO MORE ROOM FOR YOU THEREFORE YOU HAD BEST BE OFF TO ANOTHER PLANET SO IT WOULD BE IF THE WORKINGMAN WERE CONTENT TO TAKE HIS DOCTRINES FROM THE OTHER SIDEFROM THE RETAINERS OF THOSE TO WHOM GOD IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM HAS ENTRUSTED THE CARE OF THE PROPERTY INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY BUT MEANTIME THE WORKINGMAN HAS BEEN THINKING FOR HIMSELFAND EVOLVING A QUITE NEW DOCTRINE ALL HIS OWN CONCERNING THE PROPERTY INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY THIS DOCTRINE IS IN A WORD THAT THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION OF WEALTH BELONG OF RIGHT TO NO INDIVIDUAL BUT TO THE WHOLE PEOPLE AND THAT IN THE HOUR OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE PROFITMAKING SYSTEM THE THING FOR THE PEOPLE TO DO IS TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE MACHINERY AND USE IT TO PRODUCE GOODS NO LONGER FOR THOSE WHO OWN BUT FOR THOSE WHO WORK AND THAT BRINGS ME TO THE SECOND OF MY TASKS I HAVE SHOWN THE GREAT UNDERLYING ECONOMIC CAUSE WORKING IRRESISTIBLY TO FORCE THE ISSUE THERE REMAINS TO SHOW THE CONSEQUENT MOVEMENT OF PROTEST I HAVE BEFORE ME AS I WRITE A LITTLE PAMPHLET PUBLISHED BY THE STANDARD PUBLISHING COMPANY OF TERRE HAUTE INDIANA AND ENTITLED THE AMERICAN MOVEMENT BY EUGENE V DEBS IT OPENS WITH THE STATEMENT THAT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY ACCORDING TO THE PROPHECY OF VICTOR HUGO IS TO BE THE CENTURY OF HUMANITY AND WILL WITNESS THE CRASH OF DESPOTISM AND THE RISE OF WORLDWIDE DEMOCRACY FREEDOM AND BROTHERHOOD THE READER CONTINUING SOON DISCOVERS THAT THE AMERICAN MOVEMENT WITH WHICH THIS PAMPHLET DEALS IS THE AMERICAN SOCIALIST MOVEMENT THE WRITER TELLS OF ITS EARLY UTOPIAN FORMS THE OWENITES AND THE BROOKFARMERS AND NAMES THE EXILES WHO CAME FROM ABROAD IN BRINGING THE MARXIAN DOCTRINE AND INFLUENCING SUCH MEN AS HORACE GREELEY AND PARKE GODWIN THE FIRST LARGE SOCIETY TO ADOPT AND PROPAGATE SOCIALISM IN AMERICA HE WRITES WAS COMPOSED OF THE GERMAN GYMNASTIC UNIONS THROUGH THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES THE AGITATION STEADILY INCREASED LOCAL ORGANISATIONS WERE FORMED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY FOLLOWING THE PARIS COMMUNE OF AND ITS TRAGIC ENDING MANY FRENCH RADICALS CAME TO OUR SHORES AND GAVE NEW SPIRIT TO THE MOVEMENT IN THE WORKINGMANS PARTY WAS ORGANISED AND IN AT THE CONVENTION HELD IN NEWARK IT BECAME THE SOCIALIST LABOUR PARTY THE SOCIALISTS WERE INTENT UPON BUILDING UP A WORKINGCLASS PARTY FOR INDEPENDENT POLITICAL ACTION THIS PARTY COMPOSED OF THOUGHTFUL INTELLIGENT MEN AGGRESSIVE AND PROGRESSIVE OF RUGGED HONESTY AND THRILLED WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT AND ASPIRATION FOR FREEDOM BECAME FROM ITS INCEPTION A DECIDED FACTOR IN THE LABOUR MOVEMENT THE BUSY IGNORANT WORLD ABOUT THE REVOLUTIONARY NUCLEUS KNEW LITTLE OR NOTHING ABOUT IT HAD NO CONCEPTION OF ITS SIGNIFICANCE AND LOOKED UPON ITS ADHERENTS AS FOOLISH FANATICS WHOSE ANTICS WERE HARMLESS AND WHOSE DESIGNS WOULD DISSOLVE LIKE BUBBLES ON THE SURFACE OF A STREAM IN MARCH WAS INAUGURATED THE STRIKE OF THE KNIGHTS OF LABOUR ON MAY ST OF THE SAME YEAR THE GENERAL STRIKES FOR THE EIGHTHOUR WORKDAY BROKE OUT IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN LAURENCE GRONLUND PUBLISHED HIS COPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH IN EDWARD BELLAMY PUBLISHED HIS LOOKING BACKWARD AND IT HAD A WONDERFUL EFFECT UPON THE PEOPLE THE EDITIONS RAN INTO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THE AUTHOR THEN GOES ON TO NARRATE HIS VERSION OF THE PULLMAN STRIKE OF HE DECLARES THAT THE AMERICAN RAILWAY UNION OF WHICH HE WAS PRESIDENT HAD WON WHEN THE GENERAL MANAGERS ASSOCIATION CAUSED THE SWEARING IN OF AN ARMY OF DEPUTIES WHOM THE CHIEF OF POLICE OF CHICAGO DECLARED TO BE THIEVES THUGS AND EXCONVICTS AND THAT IT WAS THESE MEN WHO CAUSED THE VIOLENCE WHICH LED TO PRESIDENT CLEVELANDS ACTION AND THE BREAKING OF THE STRIKE HE THEN CONTINUES THE STORY OF THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT THE COMING NATION STARTED AT GREENSBURG INDIANA BY J A WAYLAND IN WAS THE FIRST POPULAR PROPAGANDA PAPER TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE INTERESTS OF SOCIALISM IN THIS COUNTRY IT REACHED A LARGE CIRCULATION AND THE PROCEEDS WERE USED IN FOUNDING AND DEVELOPING THE RUSKIN COPERATIVE COLONY IN TENNESSEE LATER MR WAYLAND BEGAN THE PUBLICATION OF THE APPEAL TO REASON AND IT NOW NUMBERS ITS SUBSCRIBERS BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IT IS NOT SAYING TOO MUCH FOR THE APPEAL THAT IT HAS BEEN A GREAT FACTOR IN PREPARING THE AMERICAN SOIL FOR THE SEED OF SOCIALISM ITS ENORMOUS EDITIONS HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING SPREAD BROADCAST AND COPIES MAY BE FOUND IN THE REMOTEST RECESSES AND THE MOST INACCESSIBLE REGIONS THE PERIODICAL AND WEEKLY PRESS SO NECESSARY TO ANY POLITICAL MOVEMENT IS NOW DEVELOPING RAPIDLY AND THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS THERE WILL BE A FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF REVIEWS MAGAZINES ILLUSTRATED JOURNALS AND DAILY AND WEEKLY PAPERS TO REPRESENT THE MOVEMENT AND DO BATTLE FOR ITS SUPREMACY THE LAST CONVENTION OF THE AMERICAN RAILWAY UNION WAS THE FIRST CONVENTION OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRACY OF AMERICA AND THIS WAS HELD IN CHICAGO IN JUNE THE DELEGATES VOTING TO CHANGE THE RAILWAY UNION INTO A WORKINGCLASS POLITICAL PARTY THE RAILWAY TIMES THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE UNION BECAME THE SOCIALDEMOCRAT AND LATER THE SOCIALDEMOCRATIC HERALD AND IS NOW PUBLISHED AT MILWAUKEE IN THE INTEREST OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY SINCE THE ELECTION OF THERE HAS BEEN GREATER ACTIVITY IN ORGANISING AND A MORE WIDESPREAD PROPAGANDA THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE ELECTIONS OF THE PAST IT CAN SCARCELY BE CLAIMED THAT THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT WAS REPRESENTED BY A NATIONAL PARTY IT ENTERED THESE CONTESTS WITH BUT FEW STATES ORGANISED AND WITH NO RESOURCES WORTH MENTIONING TO SUSTAIN IT DURING THE CAMPAIGN IT IS FAR DIFFERENT TODAY THE SOCIALIST PARTY IS ORGANISED IN ALMOST EVERY STATE AND TERRITORY IN THE AMERICAN UNION ITS MEMBERS ARE FILLED WITH ENTHUSIASM AND WORKING WITH AN ENERGY BORN OF THE THROB AND THRILL OF REVOLUTION THE PARTY HAS A PRESS SUPPORTING IT THAT EXTENDS FROM SEA TO SEA AND IS AS VIGILANT AND TIRELESS IN ITS LABOURS AS IT IS STEADFAST AND TRUE TO THE PARTY PRINCIPLES VIEWED TODAY FROM ANY INTELLIGENT STANDPOINT THE OUTLOOK OF THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT IS FULL OF PROMISETO THE CAPITALIST OF STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST TO THE WORKER OF COMING FREEDOM IT IS THE BREAK OF DAWN UPON THE HORIZON OF HUMAN DESTINY AND IT HAS NO LIMITATION BUT THE WALLS OF THE UNIVERSE WHATEVER THE READER MAY THINK ABOUT THE FOREGOING NARRATIVE THERE IS ONE PART OF IT WHICH HE CANNOT DISMISS THE STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE GROWTH OF THE AMERICAN SOCIALIST PARTY IN THE SOCIALIST VOTE WAS TWO THOUSAND IN IT WAS TWENTYONE THOUSAND IN IT WAS THIRTYSIX THOUSAND IN IT WAS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTYONE THOUSAND IN IT WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTYTWO THOUSAND THE SOCIALIST PARTY HAS SOME TWENTYSEVEN THOUSAND SUBSCRIBING MEMBERS WHO PAY MONTHLY DUES IT HAS OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED LOCALS OR CENTRES OF AGITATION THE MEMBERS OF THESE LOCALS ARE FOR THE MOST PART WORKINGMEN WHO GIVE THEIR SPARE HOURS TO THE CAUSE HOLDING MEETINGS AND DEBATES AND CIRCULATING THE LITERATURE OF SOCIALISM IN THE LARGER CITIES THERE ARE GENERALLY SEVERAL LECTURES EACH WEEK AND THERE ARE A SCORE OF NATIONAL ORGANISERS WHO TRAVEL ABOUT SPEAKING NIGHT AFTER NIGHT IN VARIOUS TOWNS FORMING NEW LOCALS AND TAKING SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE SOCIALIST PUBLICATIONS OF THESE THERE ARE FOUR MONTHLIES AND ABOUT THIRTYFIVE WEEKLIES SINCE WAYLANDS PAPER THE APPEAL TO REASON GIRARD KANSAS HAS INCREASED ITS PAID CIRCULATION FROM ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYSIX THOUSAND TO OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE THOUSAND AND LAST YEAR IT PRINTED ONE EDITION OF TWO MILLIONS AND A HALF AND ANOTHER OF OVER THREE MILLIONS ANOTHER SOCIALIST PAPER WILSHIRES MAGAZINE NEW YORK HAS INCREASED ITS CIRCULATION FROM FIFTYFIVE THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND IN A SINGLE YEAR IN ADDITION TO THIS THERE ARE MANY PUBLISHING COMPANIES WHICH DISTRIBUTE BOOKS LEAFLETS AND PAMPHLETS AT LITTLE MORE THAN COST I HAVE BEFORE ME A TREATISE THE PRICE OF WHICH IS ONE CENT OF WHICH OVER FIVE MILLION COPIES HAVE BEEN SOLD SINCE ITS PUBLICATION SOME YEARS AGO ITS TITLE IS WHY WORKINGMEN SHOULD BE SOCIALISTS BY GAYLORD WILSHIRE AND IN GIVING THE FIGURES OF THE SOCIALIST GROWTH IT IS WORTH WHILE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS NOT MERELY A LOCAL MOVEMENT BUT A WORLD MOVEMENT THAT THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF THE MOST BACKWARD OF THE CIVILISED NATIONS IN RESPECT TO SOCIALISM IN AUSTRALIA THE LABOUR UNIONS HAVE ADOPTED A FULL SOCIALIST PROGRAM AND THE LABOUR UNIONS HOLD THE BALANCE OF POWER IN ENGLAND THEY HAVE JUST ELECTED TWENTYSEVEN MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT THEY HAVE NOW MEMBERS IN THE CABINET OF FRANCE AND IN ITALY THEY HAVE TURNED OUT MINISTRIES IN BELGIUM THE VOTE OF THE PARTY IS HALF A MILLION AND IN AUSTRIA IT IS NEARLY A MILLION WHILE IN GERMANY IT HAS GROWN FROM THIRTY THOUSAND IN TO FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTYNINE THOUSAND IN ONE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTYSIX THOUSAND IN THREE MILLION AND EIGHT THOUSAND IN AND THREE MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND IN THE SOCIALISTS ARE ELECTING REPRESENTATIVES IN ARGENTINA AND SOUTH AFRICA IN SPITE OF GOVERNMENT PERSECUTION THE MOVEMENT IS NOW GROWING RAPIDLY IN JAPAN INCLUDING ALL LANGUAGES THE SOCIALIST JOURNALS NUMBER NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED AND THE SOCIALIST VOTE OF THE WORLD IS FIGURED AT NEARLY EIGHT MILLION ALLOWING FOR WOMEN AND FOR THE DISFRANCHISED PROLETARIAT OF SUCH NATIONS AS RUSSIA AUSTRIA AND ITALY THERE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE THIRTY MILLION CLASSCONSCIOUS SOCIALISTS IN THE WORLD TO OVERLOOK THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A MOVEMENT SUCH AS THIS IS BUT TO REPEAT UPON A LARGER SCALE THE ERROR OF HALF A CENTURY AGO AND TO PAY WITH BLOOD AND ANGUISH FOR BLUNDERING AND INDIFFERENCE THE PROCESSES OF TIME HAVE THEIR LAWS WHICH CAN BE STUDIED AND ALL THE WASTE AND RUIN OF HISTORY WHICH MAKE ITS RECORDS SCARCELY TO BE READ ARE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FACT THAT MAN HAS TO BE LASHED TO HIS GOAL THROUGH THE DARKNESS INSTEAD OF MARCHING TO IT IN THE LIGHT YOU TAKE BUT A SHALLOW VIEW OF THE PROBLEMS OF OUR PRESENT TIME IF YOU DO NOT REALISE THAT WHEN THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE IN EVERY CORNER OF THE CIVILISED WORLD ORGANISE THEMSELVES INTO A POLITICAL PARTY THEY DO IT BECAUSE OF SOME FUNDAMENTAL AND TREMENDOUS MOTIVE AND THAT THEY WILL NOT BE APT TO ABANDON THEIR EFFORTS UNTIL THEY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SOME PROPORTIONATELY SIGNIFICANT RESULT CHAPTER II INDUSTRIAL EVOLUTION HERBERT SPENCER GIVES A DEFINITION OF EVOLUTION PHRASED IN TECHNICAL TERMS WHICH MIGHT BE ROUGHLY SUMMED UP IN THESE WORDS A PROCESS WHEREBY MANY SIMILAR AND SIMPLE THINGS BECOME DISSIMILAR PARTS OF ONE COMPLEX THING IF WE TRACE FOR INSTANCE THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN SOCIETY WE SEE ABOUT AS FOLLOWS IN THE BEGINNING MAN EXISTS IN WIDELY SCATTERED AND UNRELATED TRIBES HAVING A VERY LOOSELY ORGANISED GOVERNMENT EACH INDIVIDUAL DOING ABOUT AS HE PLEASES AND ALL INDIVIDUALS BEING VERY MUCH THE SAME EACH FINDS HIS OWN FOOD AND COOKS IT MAKES HIS OWN WEAPONS AND CLOTHING AND LOOKS AND THINKS AND ACTS LIKE HIS NEIGHBOUR LITTLE BY LITTLE AS THE TRIBE GROWS IT BEGINS TO COME INTO CONTACT WITH OTHER TRIBES THAT ALSO ARE GROWING AND A PRESSURE BEGINS THE TRIBES MAKE WAR UPON EACH OTHER AND EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE TRIBE IS FORCED BY THE PRESENCE OF DANGER TO UNITE HIMSELF MORE CLOSELY WITH HIS FELLOWS TO ESTABLISH A MORE RIGID RULE OF OBEDIENCE AND TO FORCE REFRACTORY MEMBERS TO THE GENERAL WILL THEN UNDER STILL GROWING PRESSURE ONE TRIBE UNITES WITH ANOTHER AGAINST A COMMON ENEMY AND THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE TWO RULES BOTH WHICH PROCESS OF COMBINING CONTINUES UNTIL AT LAST THERE RESULTS AN ORGANISM OF GREAT COMPLEXITY WHOSE MEMBERS ARE NO LONGER EQUAL AND SELFSUSTAINING BUT HAVE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND RANKS AND CHARACTERISTICS AND ARE EACH DEPENDENT UPON THE REST IF FOR INSTANCE WE EXAMINE FRANCE DURING THE FEUDAL PERIOD WE FIND NUMEROUS PRINCIPALITIES DUCHIES AND BARONIES EACH ONE AN ELABORATE AND COMPLEX ORGANISATION WITH VARIOUS CLASSES AND HIERARCHIES AND TRIBUTARY PARTS AND A WHOLE SYSTEM OF LAWS AND CUSTOMS AND BELIEFS TO CORRESPOND AND NO SOONER IS THIS PROCESS COMPLETE THAN AN EVOLUTION BEGINS AMONG THESE ORGANISMS UNDER THE STRESS OF JEALOUSIES AND AMBITIONS THEY TOO BEGIN TO STRUGGLE TO COMBINE AND PRESENTLY IN ONE OF THEM ARISES A STRONG MAN WHO SECURES COMMAND OF THEM ALL WHEN THE PROCESS IS COMPLETED THERE STANDS IN THE PLACE OF A HUNDRED PRINCIPALITIES ONE KINGDOM THE KINGDOM OF FRANCE THE OBJECT OF ALL THIS LONG LABOUR IS OF COURSE TO GET SOME KIND OF AN ORGANISM THAT SHALL BE CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING ITSELF IN A WORLD OF FEROCIOUS STRIFE THAT SHALL BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND ALL ENEMIES THAT MAY COME AGAINST IT AND ALL REBELLIONS THAT MAY ARISE WITHIN IT THE FRENCH MONARCHY WAS A MARVELLOUS PIECE OF WORK WHEN IT WAS DONE IT HAD MEN GRADED INTO A THOUSAND DIFFERENT CLASSES AND OCCUPATIONS AND EVERYTHING FITTED PERFECTLY AND RAN LIKE A CLOCK IT HAD PEASANTS TO TILL THE SOIL AND SOLDIERS AND SAILORS TO FIGHT ARTISANS TO MAKE ALL ITS NECESSARIES AND MERCHANTS TO HANDLE THEM AND RISING TIER UPON TIER A WHOLE PYRAMID OF GOVERNING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS UP TO THE KING IT HAD LIKEWISE THE WHOLE OUTFIT OF IDEAS AND CUSTOMS NECESSARY TO ITS OPERATION IT WAS COMPLETE AND PERFECT AND SUBLIMEIT WAS LIKE A MIGHTY VESSEL DEFYING THE TEMPESTS IT HAD ALSO ITS PENNONS THAT WAVED AND ITS SONGS FOR THE CREW TO SING WAS IT ANY WONDER THAT THOSE WHO HAD MADE IT WERE PROUD OF IT AND FELT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE DONE IN THE WORLD BUT TO KEEP IT GOING AND YET EVOLUTION WAS NOT THROUGH WITH IT MEN GROW WEARY AND WANT TO REST THEY BECOME CONSERVATIVE AND FRET AT THE BARE THOUGHT OF CHANGEBUT THE PROCESSES OF LIFE GO ON INEXORABLY THIS MIGHTY STRUCTURE THE KINGDOM OF FRANCE WAS ONLY A MEANS AND NOT AN ENDITS PURPOSE WAS TO BIND THE PEOPLE OF THE NATION TOGETHER AND PROTECT THEM UNTIL THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR THIS IDEA TO MAKE ITS WAY IT TOOK A FEARFUL STRUGGLEMEN WERE IMPRISONED AND EXILED BURNED AND BEHEADED BUT THE IDEA WENT RIGHT ON AND THE NATION WENT RIGHT ON AND WHEN THE TIME CAME IT BURST THE OLD INTEGUMENT TO PIECES AND OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF FRANCE THERE EMERGED THE FRENCH REPUBLIC WHAT A MARVELLOUS EVENT THAT WAS AND WHAT A STIR IT MADE IN THE WORLDWHAT A STIR ESPECIALLY IN OUR OWN CORNER OF THE WORLDEVERY ONE KNOWS LOOKING AT IT FROM A CENTURYS DISTANCE AND CALMLY WE SEE THE WHOLE AGELONG EVENT AS AN EXEMPLIFICATION OF THE PROCESS OF LIFE THE COMBINING OF A NUMBER OF SIMPLE THINGS INTO ONE COMPLEX THING THE MEANS WAS STRUGGLE AND RIVALRYIT WAS A CRUEL PROCESS BUT YOU WILL NOTICE THAT AT THE END THE EFFORT AND THE PAIN ARE ALL GONETHAT THE ORGANISM FULFILS ITS FUNCTIONS FREELY AND JOYFULLY AND THAT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIRST STAGE AND THE LAST IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MAN HAS BEEN RAISED TO A HIGHER PLANE OF BEING NOW AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE THE FIRST CARE OF A MAN IS TO PROTECT HIS LIFE THE SECOND IS TO ACCUMULATE WEALTH A MAN DOES NOT SET MUCH STORE BY HIS GOODS WHILE HIS ENEMIES ARE WITHIN SOUND BUT JUST AS SOON AS THEY ARE DISPERSED THE TRIBE BEGINS TO GATHER FLOCKS AND TO TILL THE SOIL AND SO FOLLOWING CLOSE UPON THE HEELS OF THE EVOLUTION OF POLITICAL SOCIETY YOU HAVE THE EVOLUTION OF INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND IT IS PRECISELY THE SAME PROCESS WE MAY SEE NEARLY THE WHOLE OF IT IN THIS COUNTRY IT BEGINS WITH THE COLONIAL VILLAGE WHERE EVERY MAN OWNS A LITTLE LAND AND RAISES HIS OWN FOOD ALSO HE COBBLES HIS OWN SHOES SPINS HIS OWN WOOL WEAVES HIS OWN CLOTH AND MAKES HIS OWN CLOTHES IN THE VERY EARLIEST DAYS HE NEVER BUYS ANYTHING BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING TO BUY HE MAY BE THE DEACON OR THE SCHOOLMASTER OR THE JUDGE BUT STILL HE HAS HIS OWN FARM AND ANY OTHER MAN IN THE VILLAGE IS ABOUT AS WELL FITTED TO BE THE DEACON OR THE SCHOOLMASTER OR THE JUDGE AS HE BUT THEN HIS GOODS EXPAND AND WAR BEGINSINDUSTRIAL WAR I MEANA HORSETRADE FOR EXAMPLE POLITICAL EVOLUTION IS SLOW BECAUSE THE RATE OF INCREASE OF MEN IS LIMITED BUT THE RATE OF INCREASE OF GOODS PROVES TO BE UNLIMITED MACHINES ARE INVENTED AND STRAIGHTWAY THE INDUSTRIAL PROCESS IS ACCELERATED TENFOLD IT TOOK A THOUSAND YEARS TO EVOLVE A MONARCHY IT TOOK ONLY A HUNDRED TO EVOLVE A TRUST THE INDUSTRIAL UNITS FIGHT EACH OTHER AND THE STRONGEST SURVIVE AS EMPLOYERS THE WEAKEST BECOMING EMPLOYEES THEN AS GROWTH CONTINUES THESE VARIOUS LITTLE GROUPS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY COME INTO CONTACT AND THEY STRUGGLE ALSO THE STRUGGLE IS OF COURSE NO LONGER FIGHTING WITH SWORDSIT IS UNDERSELLING BUT THE PROCESS IS EXACTLY THE SAME AND ITS PURPOSE IS THE BUILDING UP OF A CAPABLE INDUSTRIAL ORGANISM PRECISELY AS IN ONE CASE THE TRIBES BY COMBINING FIND THEY ARE STRONGER TO FIGHT THE EMPLOYERS BY COMBINING FIND THAT THEY ARE STRONGER TO UNDERSELL AND THIS PROCESS GOES ON UNTIL YOU HAVE AN INDUSTRIAL FEUDALISM CORRESPONDING IN ALL ITS DETAILS TO THE POLITICAL FEUDALISM OF FRANCE AND THEN AS BEFORE THE BARONS AND THE PRINCES AND THE DUKES FIGHT AMONG EACH OTHER UNTIL OUT OF THE MIDST ARISES A STRONG MAN A ROCKEFELLER OR A HARRIMAN WHO SMASHES THEM RIGHT AND LEFT AND MAKES HIMSELF A KING HE IS A KING IN PRECISELY THE SAME WAY AND TO PRECISELY THE SAME PURPOSE AS LOUIS THE GREAT WAS KING YOU KNOW HOW RICHELIEU SERVED THE NOBILITY OF FRANCEIF THEY WOULD NOT OBEY THEY SIMPLY LOST THEIR HEADS IF YOU HAVE READ MISS TARBELLS HISTORY OF THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY OR HENRY D LLOYDS WEALTH AGAINST COMMONWEALTH YOU KNOW HOW MR ROCKEFELLER SERVED THE OIL NOBILITY HOW HE TRICKED THEM AND CRUSHED THEM HOW SOMETIMES IT IS SAID HE BLEW UP THEIR REFINERIES WITH DYNAMITE OR BURNED THEM WITH FIRE YOU KNOW HOW LOUIS SAID HE WAS THE STATE AND YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE COAL COMPANIES WHO IS DOING BUSINESS IN FLAT DEFIANCE OF THE LAWS OF THE LAND DECLARE THAT GOD IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM HAD ENTRUSTED TO HIM THE PROPERTY INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO PURSUE THIS ANALOGY IF YOU DO NOT SEE THAT IN THE DUE AND INEVITABLE COURSE OF EVOLUTION OUR INDUSTRIAL ORGANISM HAS ATTAINED THE MONARCHICAL STAGE IT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WISH TO SEE IT AND NO AMOUNT OF EXPOSITION WILL AVAIL I HAVE ONLY TO ADD AS BEFORE THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROCESS WAS TO EVOLVE AN ORGANISM WHICH SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING ITSELF AGAINST ALL ENEMIES WITHOUT AND WITHIN THE TASK OF KING LOUIS WAS THE AGGRANDISEMENT OF FRANCE THE TASK OF MR ROCKEFELLER IS THE KEEPING UP OF STANDARD OIL STOCK INCIDENTALLY LOUIS THE GREAT GAVE THE WORLD A RACEHERITAGE AND A CIVILISATION INCIDENTALLY MR ROCKEFELLER FURNISHES THE WORLD WITH OIL ALSOWHAT IS TRUE IN ONE CASE IS TRUE IN THE OTHERTHE STANDARD OIL COMPANY IS A MARVELLOUS PIECE OF WORK IT HAS MEN GRADED INTO A THOUSAND DIFFERENT CLASSES AND OCCUPATIONS AND ALL FITTING PERFECTLY AND RUNNING LIKE A CLOCK IT HAS LABOURERS TO TILL THE SOIL LOBBYISTS AND SALESMEN TO FIGHT FACTORIES TO MAKE ALL ITS NECESSARIES AND RAILROADS TO HANDLE THEM AND RISING TIER UPON TIER IT HAS A WHOLE PYRAMID OF GOVERNING AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS UP TO THE PRESIDENT IT HAS LIKEWISE THE WHOLE OUTFIT OF IDEAS NECESSARY TO ITS OPERATION IT IS COMPLETE AND PERFECT AND SUBLIMEIT IS LIKE A MIGHTY VESSEL DEFYING THE TEMPESTS IS IT ANY WONDER THAT THOSE WHO HAVE CONSTRUCTED IT ARE PROUD OF IT AND FEEL THAT THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE DONE IN THE WORLD BUT TO KEEP IT GOING IT IS OF COURSE CLEAR THAT THE NEXT STEP ACCORDING TO MY PARALLEL WOULD BE INTO AN INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC THE READER DIFFERS FROM MOST AMERICANS WHOM I MEET IF THIS IDEA IS NOT STARTLING TO HIM LET US GO FORWARD SLOWLY IN MR JOHN BACH MCMASTERS HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IS A NARRATIVE OF THE TERRIBLE YELLOWFEVER EPIDEMIC WHICH OCCURRED IN PHILADELPHIA IN THE YEAR CAUSING THE DEATH OF OVER FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IN FOUR MONTHS IN THOSE DAYS MEN HAD STRANGE IDEAS AS TO THE CAUSES OF YELLOW FEVER THEY BELIEVED IN THIS CASE THAT IT HAD COME FROM A PILE OF STINKING HIDES THAT HAD BEEN ON ONE OF THE WHARVES THE HISTORIAN GOES ON TO DESCRIBE THE STRANGE EXPEDIENTS THEY ADOPTED TO GET RID OF IT PEOPLE WERE BIDDEN TO KEEP OUT OF THE SUN AND NOT TO GET TIRED THE DOCTORS HAD LITTLE FAITH IN BONFIRES AS PURIFIERS OF THE AIR BUT MUCH IN THE BURNING OF GUNPOWDER EVERY ONE THEN WHO COULD BUY OR BORROW A GUN LOADED AND FIRED IT FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT THEN ONE REMEDY AFTER ANOTHER WOULD BE SUGGESTED AND PEOPLE WOULD COVER THEMSELVES WITH ITNITRE TOBACCO AND GARLIC MUDBATHS CAMPHOR AND THIEVES VINEGAR THE LAST COULD ONLY BE PROCURED BY GOING TO THE SHOP THE PURCHASER GOING TO GET IT WAS CAREFUL TO HAVE A PIECE OF TARRED ROPE WET WITH CAMPHOR AT HIS NOSE AND IN HIS POCKET HIS HANDKERCHIEF SOAKED WITH THE LAST PREVENTIVE HE HAD HEARD OF HE SHUNNED THE FOOTPATHS FLED DOWN THE NEAREST ALLEY AT SIGHT OF A CARRIAGE AND WOULD GO SIX BLOCKS TO AVOID PASSING A HOUSE WHERE A DEAD BODY HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT A WEEK BEFORE HE WOULD NOT ENTER A SHOP WHERE ANOTHER MAN STOOD AT THE COUNTER HE WOULD RUSH IN THROW DOWN THE MONEY AND RUSH HOMESOAK EVERYTHING IN THIS PREPARED VINEGAR AND LIVE ON A PRESCRIBED DIET WATERGRUEL OATMEAL TEA BARLEYWATER OR A VILE CONCOCTION CALLED APPLETEA IF HIS HEAD PAINED HIM OR HIS TONGUE FELT ROUGH HE WOULD IMMEDIATELY WASH OUT HIS MOUTH WITH WARM WATER AND HONEY AND VINEGAR ETC ETC AT THE TIME WHEN I READ ALL THIS IT MADE A PECULIAR IMPRESSION UPON ME BECAUSE THE NEWSPAPERS HAPPENED JUST THEN TO BE FULL OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE TRUE CAUSE OF YELLOW FEVER AND SO ALL THE TIME THAT I WAS READING ABOUT THE MAN WITH THE TARRED ROPE IN HIS HANDS AND A SPONGE WET WITH CAMPHOR AT HIS NOSE I HAD THIS THOUGHT IN MY MIND AND WHILE HE WAS WAITING OUTSIDE OF THE SHOP A MOSQUITO FLEW UP ALL UNHEEDED AND BIT HIM AND SO HE DIED IT SEEMED TO ME A PECULIARLY NEAT ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRECISE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE IT LED ME TO REFLECT HOW VERY EAGER MEN OUGHT TO BE TO POSSESS THE FORMER AND I PUT THE ANECDOTE AWAY IN MY MIND THINKING I SHALL USE IT SOME DAY WHEN I WANTALL OF A SUDDENTO SCARE SOMEONE OUT OF A PREJUDICE FOR JUST IMAGINE IF YOU CAN THAT MOSQUITOES INSTEAD OF BEING A PEST ABOUT WHICH EVERY MAN WAS GLAD TO BELIEVE EVIL HAD BEEN THE BASIS OF SOME IMPORTANT INDUSTRY OR OTHERWISE THE SOURCE OF INCALCULABLE ADVANTAGE TO THE DOMINANT CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY THAT UNIVERSITIES WERE ENDOWED AND NEWSPAPERS OWNED AND CHURCHES AND HOSPITALS SUPPORTED OUT OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE MOSQUITO MONOPOLY ARE YOU SURE THAT IN THAT CASE THE DISCOVERY OF THE PHYSICIANS IN HAVANA WOULD HAVE BEEN HAILED AS A TRIUMPH OF SCIENCE OR DO YOU NOT THINK THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE FANTASTIC SPECULATION AND THAT THE MEN WHO HAD PUBLISHED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DENOUNCED AS ENEMIES OF SOCIETY AND TURNED OUT OF OFFICE FOR THEIR INCENDIARY TEACHINGS THAT OTHER PHYSICIANS OF HIGH STANDING MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOUND TO RIDICULE THE IDEA THAT NEWSPAPERS MIGHT HAVE REFUSED TO PRINT ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF ITTHAT IN SHORT THE MOSQUITO MONOPOLY MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN CONJURING UP BEFORE THE IMAGINATIONS OF THE MULTITUDE SO HORRIBLE AN IMAGE OF THIS DOCTRINE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE LOOKED UPON ANYONE WHO ADVOCATED IT AS IN SOME WAY MORALLY DEFORMED ASSUMING THAT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DONE THERE ARE ONLY TWO THINGS TO BE ADDED THE FIRST IS THAT ALL THE WHILE THE MOSQUITOES WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT ON CAUSING THE YELLOW FEVER AND THE SECOND IS THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT OUT IN THE ENDTHAT ALL THAT THE MAKERS OF PUBLIC OPINION WOULD HAVE DONE WOULD BE TO PUT JUST SO MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THE POCKETS OF THE MOSQUITO MONOPOLY AT A COST OF JUST SO MUCH MISERY TO THE HUMAN RACE AT THE OUTSET OF THIS ARGUMENT I VERY MUCH WISH THAT YOU THE READER WOULD COMMUNE WITH YOURSELF PRAYERFULLY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT MIGHT NOT POSSIBLY BE THAT THE IDEAS YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD CONCERNING AN INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC ARE REALLY NOT IDEAS OF YOUR OWN AT ALL BUT PREJUDICES WHICH OTHER PEOPLE HAVE PUT THERE FOR PURPOSES KNOWN TO THEM LET ME REPEAT THE DEFINITION WHICH I GAVE AT THE OUTSET OF THIS ARGUMENT I MEAN BY AN INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC AN ORGANISATION FOR THE PRODUCTION OF WEALTH WHOSE MEMBERS ARE ESTABLISHED UPON A BASIS OF EQUALITY WHO ELECT REPRESENTATIVES TO GOVERN THE ORGANISATION AND WHO SHARE EQUALLY IN ALL ITS ADVANTAGES A CENTURY OR TWO AGO OUR ANCESTORS WERE GOVERNED BY GRACE OF GOD BY AN UNAMIABLE OLD GENTLEMAN OVER IN ENGLAND WHO CONTROLLED THEIR DESTINIES AND SENT HIS REPRESENTATIVES OVER HERE TO TAX AND OPPRESS THEM AND THEY IMPIOUSLY ROSE UP AND ADOPTED A DECLARATION TO THE EFFECT THAT ALL MEN WERE BORN FREE AND EQUAL AND THEY SEIZED THE PROPERTY AND REVENUES OF THEIR KING AND THEREAFTER MANAGED THE COUNTRY FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT SOLELY NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION HAD BEEN THEIR DOCTRINE BEFOREHAND AND YOU WHO ARE AN AMERICAN AND CELEBRATE THE FOURTH OF JULY AND TEACH YOUR CHILDREN TO ADMIRE THE MEN WHO THREW THE TEA INTO BOSTON HARBOURDO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD GIVE ME ANY REASON WHY A MAN HAS A RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED WHERE HE PAYS HIS TAXES AND NO RIGHT TO BE REPRESENTED WHERE HE GETS HIS DAILY BREAD DO YOU NOT PERCEIVE THAT A MAN WHO CAN SAY TO ME DO THUS OR YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN CAN HAVE NOTHING TO EAT IS JUST AS MUCH MY LORD AND MASTER AS THE MAN WHO CAN SAY TO ME DO THUS OR BE PUT INTO JAIL YOU STOP AND THINK THE CASE IS NOT QUITE THE SAME YOU SAY ONE IS NOT REPRESENTED TO BE SURE BUT CERTAINLY EVERY MAN HAS A RIGHT TO GET HIS DAILY BREAD AS HE PLEASES INDEED I ANSWER SUPPOSE FOR INSTANCE THAT HIS OCCUPATION HAPPENS TO BE THAT OF A STEELWORKER HAS HE ANY WAY OF GETTING HIS DAILY BREAD EXCEPT UPON CERTAIN PRECISE TERMS WHICH A CERTAIN GROUP OF MEN OFFER HIM HM YOU SAY THATS SO BUT THEN IF HE DOESNT LIKE IT CANT HE CHANGE HIS OCCUPATION MY ANSWER IS I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT GEORGE THE THIRD WOULD HAVE HAD ANY OBJECTION TO ONE OF OUR ANCESTORS GOING TO FRANCE TO BECOME A SUBJECT OF KING LOUIS BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT FREEDOM BEGAN IN AMERICA WHEN THE MEN OF LEXINGTON AND BUNKER HILL RESOLVED TO STAY AT HOME AND BE FREE THIS IS ALL VERY WELL IN THEORY YOU SAY BUT HOW CAN IT EVER BE REALISED AS I SAID BEFORE I EXPECT TO SEE IT REALISED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS I EXPECT TO SEE IT EXACTLY AS I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION HAD I KNOWN WHAT I KNOW NOW UNDERSTOOD THAT INSTITUTIONS AND SYSTEMS HAVE THEIR DAY AND PERCEIVED THE SIGNS OF A BREAKDOWN AS THEY EXISTED IN FRANCE IN AND AS THEY EXIST IN AMERICA IN WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THE FRENCH MONARCHY WAS ORGANISED UPON A BASIS OF FORCE REPRESENTED BY TAXES AND THOSE WHO RAN THE MACHINE HAD NO IDEA BUT THAT A MACHINE SO ORGANISED COULD GO ON FOREVER BUT IN THE LONG PROCESS OF TIME THERE DEVELOPED A TENDENCY ON THE PART OF THOSE TO WHOM THE TAXES CAME TO GROW RICHER AND RICHER WHILE THOSE BY WHOM THE TAXES WERE PAID GREW POORER AND POORER LITTLE BY LITTLE ALL THE PROPERTY AND ALL THE LAND OF FRANCE CAME INTO THE HANDS OF THE NOBILITY UNTIL AT LAST THEY HAD EVERYTHING AND THE POPULACE HAD NOTHING THEN SUDDENLY THE MACHINERY OF A SOCIETY ORGANISED UPON A BASIS OF FORCE AND TAXES BEGAN TO REFUSE TO WORK THE FRENCH PEASANTRY HAD STOOD EVERYTHING BUT THEY COULD NOT STAND BEING REQUIRED TO PAY TAXES WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING TO PAY WITH SO THE STATESGENERAL HAD TO BE SENT FOR AND THE REVOLUTION CAME AND NOTE THISTHAT THE TROUBLE WAS NOT AT ALL THAT THE COUNTRY WAS POOR EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR WITH THE PICTURE OF THE HORRIBLE CONDITION OF THE PEASANTRY OF THAT TIME HOW THEY WERE LITTLE BETTER THAN WILD ANIMALS HIDING IN HOLES NAKED AND WITH BLACKENED SKINS YET ALL THE WHILE FRANCE WAS FULL OF WEALTHALL THE TROUBLE WAS THAT IT WAS STAGNANT IN THE HANDS OF A SINGLE CLASS THE FIELDS OF FRANCE WERE READY TO PRODUCE BUT THE PEOPLE WERE TOO POOR TO TILL THEM AND NOTICE THE CURIOUS FACT THAT NO SOONER WAS THE REVOLUTION ACCOMPLISHED THAN THE DIFFICULTY VANISHED IN A FLASH THE MACHINERY STARTED UP AGAINTHE PEASANT HAD LAND AND TILLED IT AND THE ARTISANS OF THE CITIES FOUND WORK IT SEEMS STRANGE TO READ THAT UNDER THE TERROR WHEN THE HEADS OF THE ARISTOCRATS WERE FALLING BY THE DOZENS EVERY DAY AND ALL THE WORLD WAS CONVULSED WITH HORROR THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE WERE MORE PROSPEROUS AND HAPPY THAN EVER THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE IN HISTORY AND WHEN WAR BROKE OUT THE NATION THAT HAD BEEN ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY FOR A GENERATION WITHSTOOD THE ARMIES OF THE COMBINED KINGDOMS OF EUROPE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS HERE IN AMERICA WE ALL STARTED EVEN WAGES WERE HIGH AND THERE WAS WORK FOR EVERY MAN THERE WAS NO NEED TO STRIKEA WORKINGMAN HAD ONLY TO LEAVE AND GO ELSEWHERE IF HE WERE NOT PLEASED WE FOUND EMPLOYMENT FOR THE STREAM OF IMMIGRANTS AS FAST AS THEY CAMEWE HAD AN ENORMOUS COUNTRY TO BUILD UP AND AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLY OF NEW LANDS FOR THE SETTLER WE MANUFACTURED ONLY FOR OUR OWN USE AND WE COULD NOT MANUFACTURE HALF OF WHAT WE NEEDED BUT TIME PASSED ON SOME WHO WERE FRUGAL AND DILIGENTAND OTHERS WHO WERE CUNNING AND UNSCRUPULOUSGREW RICH AND THEN MACHINERY CAME IN AND THE PACE GREW FASTER THE RICH WERE ON TOP AND THEY STAYED THERE AS THE COUNTRY EXPANDED RAILROADS WERE BUILT AND FORTUNES MADE THE WAR CAME WITH ITS ENORMOUS EXPENDITURES AND STILL MORE FORTUNES WERE MADE CAPITAL GREW BUT IT COULD NOT GROW FAST ENOUGHIN THE SEVENTIES THE RATE OF INTEREST WAS TEN PER CENT AND THE PROMOTERS MADE FORTUNES BESIDES IT WAS IN THOSE DAYS THAT THE BATTLES OF THE GIANTS WERE FOUGHT THE RAILROAD WARS IN WHICH THE GOULD AND VANDERBILT MILLIONS WERE ACCUMULATED STILL THERE WAS PLENTY TO DO THE PEOPLE HAD MONEY AND THERE WERE SOME OF THEM TO BUY EVERYTHING WE COULD MAKE AND WHAT CAME FROM ABROAD BESIDES THE CITIES GREW AND SPREAD AND THE IMMIGRANTS FLOWED IN RAILROADS AND FACTORIES WERE BUILT AND THE MIGHTY STRUCTURE OF OUR MODERN INDUSTRIAL MACHINE BEGAN TO TAKE SHAPE IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL THE WHILE INVENTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS WERE BEING MADE THAT ENABLED ONE MAN TO DO THE WORK OF TEN OF FIFTY OF A HUNDRED AND EACH SUCH IMPROVEMENT SET FREE SO MANY THOUSANDS MORE MEN TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO ANOTHER PART OF THE STRUCTURE AND TO RUSH IT ON TO COMPLETION COMPLETION HAS IT NEVER DAWNED UPON YOU THAT THIS MACHINE MIGHT POSSIBLY SOME DAY REACH COMPLETION THE PURPOSE OF IT IS A VERY DEFINITE AND OBVIOUS ONEIT IS TO SUPPLY THE NEEDS OF MEN AND WHEN IT IS ADEQUATE TO THAT PURPOSE IT IS COMPLETE BUT HOW WILL YOU KNOW WHEN THAT IS WHY BY THE SIMPLEST OF METHODS IN THE WORLDBY THAT INSUFFICIENCY OF PROFITS WHICH I DESCRIBED BEFORE YOU ARE IN BUSINESS FOR PROFITS YOU UNDERSTAND AND WHEN YOU ARE MAKING SOMETHING THAT MEN NEED YOU MAKE PROFITS AND WHEN YOU ARE MAKING SOMETHING THAT MEN DO NOT NEED YOU STOP MAKING PROFITS IT WOULD BE TOO BAD IF MEN WENT ON MAKING RAILROADS WHERE NO ONE WANTED TO RIDE AND BUILDING HOUSES FOR NO ONE TO OCCUPY HOW FORTUNATE THAT NATURE HAS ARRANGED IT SO THAT WE ALL KNOW WHEN OUR WORK IS DONE WE WERE TREMBLING ON THE VERY VERGEIN FACT WE WERE HALFWAY OVER THE VERGETHREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE RUSSOJAPANESE WAR CAME ALONG AND SAVED US EVERYBODY HAD BEGUN TO REALISE THE PERIL THE INVESTOR WHO HAD BEEN MAKING TEN PER CENT IN THE SEVENTIES CAME DOWN TO THREE THE WORKINGMAN WHO HAD A JOB THAT DID NOT SUIT HIM STUCK TO IT ALL THE SAME BECAUSE HE SAW A MILLION MEN IN THE COUNTRY WHO HAD NO JOB AT ALL AND THE CAPITALIST THE CAPTAIN OF INDUSTRYHE MOUNTED INTO HIS WATCHTOWER AND PROCEEDED TO SCAN THE LANDSCAPE A MARKET A MARKET MY KINGDOM FOR A MARKET OUR NEWSPAPERS A FEW YEARS AGO WERE QUITE WILD WITH DELIGHT OVER A PHENOMENON CALLED THE AMERICAN INVASION THEY TOLD HOW WE WERE CONQUERING ALL OVER THE WORLDHOW EUROPE STOOD SHUDDERING WITH FRIGHTHOW OUR EXPORTS WERE MOUNTING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS HOW PROSPEROUS WE WERE WHAT OCEANTIDES OF WEALTH WERE COMING IN TO US IT SEEMED SO STRANGE TO READ IT ALL AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS INVASION WHICH THE EDITORS WERE CELEBRATING WAS IN REALITY THE LAST DEATHKICK OF THE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM WHICH THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO CONSIDER THE FOUNDATION OF ALL SOCIETY IT WILL BE MORE CONVENIENT TO CONSIDER THE WHOLE QUESTION OF FOREIGN MARKETS AT A LATER STAGE SUFFICE IT HERE TO SAY THAT IF MY ANALYSIS OF THE OVERPRODUCTION OF CAPITAL BE CORRECT THEN THE FIRST SIGNAL OF DANGER WILL BE WHAT IS COMMONLY HAILED AS A FAVOURABLE BALANCE OF TRADETHE EXISTENCE OF A SURPLUS PRODUCT WHICH MUST BE SOLD ABROAD YOU MUST DISTINGUISH OF COURSE BETWEEN A MERE EXCHANGE OF GOODS WHERE EXPORTS ARE BALANCED BY IMPORTS AND SELLING WHICH IS SENDING OUT GOODS AND TAKING IN GOLD OR PROMISES TO PAY GOLD IN OUR EXPORTS WERE EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTYSEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND OUR IMPORTS WERE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTYSIX MILLIONS BUT IN OUR EXPORTS HAD LEAPED TO ONE BILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTYSEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND OUR IMPORTS HAD SUNK TO EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTYTHREE MILLIONS AND DURING THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THE EXCESS OF EXPORTS OVER IMPORTS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL OF OVER A BILLION AND A HALF OF DOLLARS ACCORDING TO AN ESTIMATE MADE PUBLIC ON JANUARY BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY THE FIGURES FOR WILL BE IMPORTS ONE BILLION TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND EXPORTS ONE BILLION EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND FOR HOW MANY MORE YEARS DOES ANYONE IMAGINE THAT THE WORLD WILL BE ABLE TO PAY US SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH FOR THOSE SURPLUS PRODUCTS WHICH WE ARE COMPELLED TO SELL DO NOT FAIL TO MARK THE WORD COMPELLED IF WE CANNOT SELL THEM WE CANNOT MAKE PROFITS AND IF WE CANNOT MAKE PROFITS WE CANNOT PAY DIVIDENDS I AM A GREAT CLAMOURER FOR DIVIDENDS SAID MR ROCKEFELLER AND OTHER CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY SHARE IN HIS WEAKNESS AND WHEN A FEW YEARS AGO THEY FOUND THAT FOREIGN MARKETS WERE BEGINNING TO FAIL THEY SET TO WORK TO REMEDY THE EVIL IN THE ONLY OTHER POSSIBLE WAYBY COMBINING AND LIMITING THE PRODUCT AND RAISING PRICES AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE OTHER GREAT SYMPTOM OF THE APPROACH OF THE BREAKDOWNTHE ORGANISING OF THE TRUSTS FOR SIX OR EIGHT YEARS THE PROCESS HAS BEEN GOING ON IRRESISTIBLY AUTOMATICALLYWHILE THE COUNTRY RAGED AND STORMED AND POURED OUT ITS WRATH UPON THE GREEDY CAPITALIST AND YET THE CAPITALIST WAS NO MORE TO BLAME THAN A STEAMENGINE THAT TURNS ASIDE WHEN IT COMES TO A SWITCH THE CAPITALIST WAS MAKING PROFITS AND HE SAW BY THE CESSATION OF HIS PROFITS THAT THE INDUSTRIAL MACHINE OF THE COUNTRY WAS GETTING TOO BIG FOR THE COUNTRYS USE UNLESS HE AND THE MACHINE ALSO WERE TO GO TO SMASH COMPETITION IN THAT PARTICULAR INDUSTRY MUST BE ENDED THE WORK IS DONE NOW WE HAVE ONLY TO SIT BY AND WAIT UNTIL THE PEOPLE GET THROUGH TRYING TO UNDO IT I NEVER REALISE MORE KEENLY THE NAVE AND TOUCHING INCOMPETENCE OF OUR SOCALLED INTELLECTUAL CLASSES THAN WHEN I REFLECT THAT WHILE OUR MEN OF ACTION HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHING THIS MIGHTY WORKONE OF THE GREATEST LABOURS EVER WROUGHT FOR CIVILISATIONOUR BENEVOLENT EDITORS AND COLLEGE PRESIDENTS HAVE GONE RIGHT ON WITH THEIR PRATTLING OF FREEDOM OF CONTRACT AND LAISSEZ FAIRE AND ACTUALLY CIVILISATION MUST SIT BY AND WAIT TEN YEARS UNTIL OUR PEOPLE HAVE GOT THROUGH BUTTING THEIR HEADS AGAINST THE GRANITE WALL OF THIS ACCOMPLISHED FACT BUT WE SOCIALISTS HAVE TO TAKE THE WORLD AS WE FIND IT AND CULTIVATE A CHEERFUL DISPOSITION AND SO BEHOLD OUR GREAT NATIONAL SPECTACLE THE MORALITYPLAY OF THE TERRIBLE HUNDREDHEADED MONSTER OF COMPETITION THE TERRIBLE MONSTER HAS KILLED AND DESTROYED HIMSELF ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF HIM BUT NOW BY CONGRESSIONAL STATUTE AND SUPREME COURT DECREE HE HAS BEEN PATCHED TOGETHER AGAIN AND WILL BE COMPELLED TO GO ON FIGHTING OR AT LEAST HE SHALL BE STUFFED AND MOUNTED AND SHALL LOOK AS IF HE WERE FIGHTING HE SHALL HAVE WIRES ATTACHED TO HIS JOINTS AND ELECTRIC LIGHTS TO GLEAM FROM HIS EYES HE SHALL BE TAKEN OUT IN THE GORGEOUS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN CHARIOT DRAWN BY THE GRAND OLD PARTY ELEPHANT AND ALL THE PEOPLE SHALL SEE HIM AND MARVEL AT HIS FEROCITY AND AT THE DEADLY CONFLICT HE WAGES AMONG HIS VARIOUS HEADS COME NOW O PEOPLECOME EDITORS AND STATESMEN AND JUDGES AND BISHOPSCOME AND SEE HOW THE TERRIBLE HUNDREDHEADED MONSTER RENDS AND TEARS HIMSELF AND SHOUT FOR FOUR YEARS MORE OF THE FULL DINNERPAIL BUT SURELY WE MUST DESTROY THE TRUSTS YOU SAY WHY MUST WE DESTROY THE TRUSTS THE TRUSTS ARE MARVELLOUS INDUSTRIAL MACHINES OF POWER THE LIKE OF WHICH WAS NEVER KNOWN IN THE WORLD BEFORE THEY ARE THE LAST AND MOST WONDERFUL OF THE PRODUCTS OF CIVILISATIONAND WE MUST DESTROY THEM WE HAVE BEEN A CENTURY BUILDING THEMYOU AND I AND THE BALANCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TOILED FOR THREE GENERATIONS NIGHT AND DAY STINTING AND STARVING OURSELVES SO THAT WE MIGHT GET THESE TRUSTS FINISHED WE HAVE TAXED OURSELVES TEN TWENTY THIRTY PER CENT OF OUR INCOMES UNDER THE DISGUISE OF A PROTECTIVE TARIFF TO MAINTAIN AND DEVELOP THEM AND NOW THAT THEY ARE COMPLETE WE MUST DESTROY THEM BUT THEY BELONG TO ROCKEFELLER YOU PROTEST TO ME THEY BELONG TO ROCKEFELLER IN PRECISELY THE SAME WAY AND TO PRECISELY THE SAME EXTENT AS THE KINGDOM OF FRANCE BELONGED TO LOUIS XIV OR THE NORTH AMERICAN COLONIES TO GEORGE III THEY BELONG TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES WHO MADE THEM WHO CONTRIBUTED EVERY PLANK OF THEM AND DROVE EVERY NAIL OF THEM AND WHO PAID MR ROCKEFELLER AND HIS FAMILY AMPLE LIVING WAGES WHILE THEY SUPERINTENDED THE JOB BUT YOU ONLY ANSWER AGAINWE MUST DESTROY THE TRUSTS GO AHEAD THEN AND HAVE YOUR TRY HAVE IT OUT WITH THEM WAR TO THE HILT WITH THEMAND SEE WHICH IS THE STRONGER TWO CORPORATIONS WHICH ARE RESOLVED NOT TO CUT EACH OTHERS THROATS OR YOU WITH YOUR LAW THAT THEY SHALL CUT EACH OTHERS THROATS TWO RAILROAD SYSTEMS WHICH KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT CONTINUE TO EXIST SEPARATELY OR YOU WHO ARE RESOLVED THAT THEY SHALL NOT EXIST TOGETHERIT MAKES ONE THINK OF THE SCENE IN TWELFTH NIGHT WHERE SIR TOBY HAS ENGINEERED A BLOODY DUEL BETWEEN TWO TERRORSTRICKEN ANTAGONISTS POX ONT ILL NOT MEDDLE WITH HIM CRIES SIR ANDREW AGUECHEEK COME SIR ANDREW SAYS SIR TOBY THERES NO REMEDY COME ON TOT BUT POOR SIR ANDREW WILL NOT TOT HE FIGHTS WITH HIS BACK TO THE ENEMY ILLUSTRATION COURTESY OF WILSHIRES MAGAZINE A SOCIALIST VIEW OF THE TRUSTS YOU WILL HEAR PEOPLE ABUSE THE SOCIALISTS FOR WISHING TO ABOLISH COMPETITION NO SOCIALIST WISHES TO ABOLISH COMPETITION NO MODERN SOCIALIST AT ANY RATE HE WATCHES COMPETITION AS THE MISCHIEVOUS IRISHMEN WATCHED THE KILKENNY CATS KEEPING OFF AT A SUITABLE DISTANCE DURING THE BATTLE AND SIMPLY PROPOSING TO THE SPECTATORS THAT WHEN IT IS ALL OVER THEY SHALL RECOGNISE THE ACCOMPLISHED FACT THERE IS SOME COMPETITION IN THE WORLD TODAY AMONG THE NATIONS THERE WAS RECENTLY COMPETITION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND JAPAN AND THERE WILL PERHAPS BE COMPETITION BETWEEN SOME OF THE OTHERS BUT WHAT COMPETITION IS LEFT TODAY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES IS LEFT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS OF A KIND SO PETTY THAT THE CAPITALISTS HAVE NOT YET HAD TIME TO BOTHER WITH IT FOR THE MOST PART IT EXISTS BETWEEN A SWARM OF RETAILERS OF TRUSTMADE PRODUCTS AND TAKES THE FORM OF THE SCREWING DOWN OF THE WAGES OF HELPLESS CLERKS AND ERRANDBOYS THE ADULTERATION OF PRODUCTS AND THE PLACARDING OF THE SURFACE OF THE LAND WITH BLATANT ADVERTISEMENTS WHICH AFFECT A DECENT MAN LIKE THE STENCH OF A CARCASS ONE OF THE COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES THAT IS FLOURISHING JUST NOW IS THAT OF CEREALS PREPARED IN PACKAGES AND LABELLED WITH NAMES THAT SUGGEST HIAWATHA AND THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS THE USUAL PRICE OF ONE OF THESE PACKAGES IS FIFTEEN CENTS AND OF THAT TWO CENTS AND A HALF REPRESENTS THE COST OF THE PRODUCT AND NEARLY ALL OF THE BALANCE GOES INTO THE EFFORT TO TRAP THE PUBLIC INTO BUYING IT AND DID NOT THE BOODLE INVESTIGATIONS IN MISSOURI DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT WILLIAM ZIEGLER HAD SPENT A FORTUNE IN BRIBING NEWSPAPERS AND LEGISLATURES TO IMPLANT IN THE PUBLIC MIND THE IDEA THAT ALUM BAKINGPOWDERS WERE POISONOUS SO THAT THE ROYAL BAKING POWDER TRUST MIGHT HAVE THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY BUT YOU SAY IF COMPETITION PERISHES WHAT BECOMES OF INCENTIVEOF INITIATIVE WILL NOT INDIVIDUAL ENTERPRISE BE DESTROYED I ANSWER THAT IT DEPENDS ENTIRELY UPON WHAT YOU MEAN BY INDIVIDUAL ENTERPRISE IF YOU MEAN THAT ARDENT DESIRE WHICH NOW CONSUMES EVERY MAN TO CUT HIS NEIGHBOURS ECONOMIC THROAT TO GET THE BETTER OF HIM AND MAKE MONEY OUT OF HIM TO BEAT HIM DOWN AND LEAVE HIM A FINANCIAL WRECKWHY CIVILISATION WILL SUPPRESS THIS ARDENT DESIRE IN PRECISELY THE SAME WAY THAT IT HAS SUPPRESSED THE DUEL OR THE RIGHT OF PRIVATE VENGEANCE AND PIRACY OR THE RIGHT OF PRIVATE WAR UPON THE HIGH SEAS THE PUTTING DOWN OF THESE THINGS WENT HARD YOU KNOW FOR THEY HAD BEEN THE GREATEST GLORY OF MEN AND ALL PROGRESS HAS BEEN DUE TO THEM FRANZ VON SICKINGEN WAS A ROBBERKNIGHT WRITES HENDERSON IN HIS HISTORY OF GERMANY BUT WITH SUCH NOBLE TRAITS AND SUCH A CONCEPT OF HIS CALLING THAT ONE WONDERS IF HE OUGHT NOT RATHER TO BE PUT ON THE LEVEL OF A BELLIGERENT PRINCE IN CARRYING ON FEUDS HE SELDOM AIMED LOWER THAN A DUKE OR A FREE CITY OF THE EMPIRE AND THERE ARE PERSONS WHO INSIST TO THIS DAY THAT HIS WEAPONS WERE ONLY DRAWN IN FAVOUR OF THE OPPRESSED BE THAT AS IT MAY HE WAS NOT ABOVE EXACTING ENORMOUS FINES AND BEING AN EXCELLENT MANAGER HE GREATLY INCREASED HIS POSSESSIONS HE WAS LORD OF MANY CASTLES WHICH HE FURNISHED WITH SPLENDID DEFENCES AND THEN THE HISTORIAN GOES ON TO DESCRIBE THE GALLANT STRUGGLE OF THIS OLD NOBLEMAN AGAINST THE ADVANCING POWER OF THE EMPIRE HE DETERMINED BY ONE BRILLIANT FEUD TO RESTORE THE TARNISHED SPLENDOUR OF HIS NAME HE WOULD HELP THE WHOLE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD TO ASSERT ITSELF AGAINST THE POWER OF THE PRINCES THE END OF IT WAS THAT THE ENEMY APPEARED IN FULL FORCE DEMOLISHED IN A SINGLE DAY AN OUTER TOWER WITH WALLS THE THICKNESS OF TWENTY FEET AND MADE A BREACH IN THE ACTUAL RAMPARTS HAVING BEEN WOUNDED THE GRIM COMMANDER WAS CARRIED TO A DARK DEEP VAULT OF THE CASTLE WHERE IT WAS THOUGHT HE WOULD BE SAFE FROM THE CANNONBALLS OF HIS PURSUERS SUCH AN UNCHRISTIAN SHOOTING HE DECLARED TO AN ATTENDANT HE HAD NEVER HEARD IN ALL HIS DAYS THE CASTLE SURRENDERED AND HIS FOES GATHERED ABOUT HIM HE HAD NOW TO DO HE SAID WITH A GREATER LORD AND A FEW HOURS LATER HE CLOSED HIS EYES THE THREE PRINCES KNELT AT HIS SIDE AND PRAYED GOD FOR THE PEACE OF HIS SOUL LET US HOPE THAT THE MAKERS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC WILL NOT FORGET TO PRAY FOR THE SOULS OF BAER AND PARRY IF THESE GALLANT CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY SHOULD PERISH IN DEFENDING THE ELEMENTAL RIGHT OF A CAPITALIST TO MANAGE HIS OWN BUSINESS IN HIS OWN WAY THIS IS ALL VERY WELL YOU SAY BUT WILL NOT SUCH A SYSTEM DECREASE PRODUCTION I RATHER THINK THAT IT WILL I HOPE TO SEE THE PROPHECY OF ANNIE BESANT COME TRUE THAT WHEN MEN NO LONGER HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO GET A LIVING THEY WILL AT LAST BEGIN TO LIVE THAT THEY WILL AT LAST OPEN THEIR EYES TO THE WORLD OF BOOKS AND MUSIC OF NATURE AND ART OF FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE THAT STRETCHES OUT ITS ARMS TO THEM THAT THEY WILL CEASE TO REGARD INGENUITY AND RAPIDITY IN THE PRODUCTION OF MATERIAL THINGS AS THE FINAL END AND GOAL OF THE CREATION OF MAN THAT THEY WILL CEASE TO LOOK UPON A HUMAN BEING AS A MACHINE FOR THE GETTING OF MONEYTO BE VALUED LIKE AN AUTOMOBILE BY THE NUMBER OF MILES AN HOUR IT CAN BE DRIVEN BY THE NUMBER OF THOUSANDS OF MILES IT CAN COVER BEFORE IT IS WORN OUT AND READY FOR THE SCRAPHEAP LET US HAVE THE PHILOSOPHY OF THIS THING IN ORDER THAT WE MAY UNDERSTAND IT WE SAW THAT THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION IN AN INDIVIDUAL OR IN A SOCIETY CONSISTS OF AN EXPANSION AND A STRUGGLE THE END OF WHICH IS THE EMERGENCE OF THE ORGANISM INTO A HIGHER STATE OF BEING THERE IS A CERTAIN LIFE IMPULSE AND THERE IS A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENT CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES WITH WHICH IT CONTENDS WE HAVE PERHAPS NO RIGHT TO SPEAK OF PURPOSE IN THE PROCESS BUT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK OF RESULTS AND THE RESULT OF THIS CONTEST IS TO SHAPE THE ORGANISM TO EDUCATE IT TO BRING OUT CERTAIN QUALITIES IN IT WHICH IT DID NOT POSSESS BEFORE UNTIL FINALLY IT TRIUMPHS OVER ITS ENVIRONMENT AND EMERGES FROM ITS PRISONHOUSE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE GOES ON BUT THE FORM OF IT CHANGES UNCEASINGLY AND THIS CHANGING IS PROGRESS WITHOUT IT THERE CAN BE NONETHE VERY ESSENCE OF PROGRESS CONSISTS IN THE SUPPRESSING OF OLD FORMS OF STRIFE THE CONQUEST OF OLD DIFFICULTIES AND THE ESCAPE FROM THEIR THRALDOM WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN MEN WERE HAIRY BEINGS WHO DWELT IN CAVES AND CONTENDED WITH CLUB AND HATCHET AGAINST THE MONSTERS WHICH ASSAILED THEM AND NOW SUPPOSING THAT WE COULD TAKE SOME MAN OF MODERN TIMES SOME ONE WHO HAS RISEN TO EMINENCE AND POWER UNDER THE CONDITIONS WHICH NOW PREVAIL AND PUT HIM AMONG THOSE CAVEMEN HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD MAKE OUT HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD FARE IF HE WERE PLACED EVEN ONE CENTURY BACK IN THE COUNTRY OF THE IROQUOIS WHERE THE SNAPPING OF A TWIG AND THE FLIGHT OF AN ARROW DECIDED THE FATE OF A MAN IS IT NOT OBVIOUS THAT THERE HAS BEEN HERE AN ENTIRE CHANGE IN THE FORM OF THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE THE SAME THING IS TRUE OF NATIONS ONCE UPON A TIME A NATION WAS AN ARMY AND FIGHTING WAS ITS BUSINESS THE CONQUERING OF ITS NEIGHBOURS WAS ITS GLORY AND ITS IDEAL BUT NOW WE HAVE MOVED ON WE HAVE BECOME COMPLEX AND HIGHLY ORGANISED AND CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO CONQUER OUR NEIGHBOURS IT WOULD NOT PAY US FINANCIALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY AND MORALLY IT WOULD DESTROY US WE HAVE FOR INSTANCE A POWERFUL COUNTRY TO THE NORTH OF US AND IMAGINE WHAT WOULD BE THE INCONVENIENCE AND WASTE WERE WE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF FORTIFYING ALL OUR BOUNDARY LINES AND KEEPING GARRISONS AT EVERY FEW MILES OF THEM IF EVERY DAY WE WERE SHAKEN BY RUMOURS THAT AN ARMY WAS GATHERING AT MONTREAL THAT A FLEET OF TORPEDOBOATS WAS BUILDING AT TORONTO AS A MATTER OF SIMPLE FACT DO WE NOT BOTH GO QUIETLY ON OUR WAY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE TWO CIVILISED NATIONS BETWEEN WHICH A WAR OF CONQUEST WOULD BE AN UNTHINKABLE CRIME WE HAVE GROWN TO USED TO THE CHANGE THAT THE MERE MEMORY OF THE OLD WAYS OF LIFE MAKES US SHUDDER IT SEEMS TO US HORRIBLE AND WE FORGET THAT IT WAS ONCE BEAUTIFUL AND DELIGHTFUL TO MEN THAT THE GERMANS OF THE TIME OF TACITUS HELD FIGHTING THE JOY OF LIFE AND IMAGINED A HEAVEN WHERE A MAN MIGHT BE PATCHED UP EVERY NIGHT AND FIGHT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY WE HAVE PASSED SO FAR BEYOND SUCH A STATE THAT WE CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE IT AND WE HAVE LOST THE POWER OF SEEING THAT IT WAS EVER NECESSARY AND RIGHT THAT TO THOSE LONG AGES OF STRUGGLE WE OWE OUR PHYSICAL BEING WITH ALL ITS PERFECTIONS WHICH WE TAKE SO AS A MATTER OF COURSE A SWIFT FOOT AND A DEXTEROUS HAND AN EAR ATTUNED TO EVERY SOUND AN EYE THAT ADJUSTS ITSELF TO EVERY DISTANCE A MIND QUICK AND ALERT A SPIRIT BOLD AND ENTERPRISING AND IN THE SAME WAY THE NATIONS OWE TO WAR THEIR UNITY AND THEIR COMPLEXITY AND A GREAT DEAL OF THEIR POWER NOT MERELY PHYSICAL BUT INDUSTRIAL AND MORAL AS WELL IT WAS ONE OF THE NOBLEST OF THE WORLDS POETS WHO WROTE THAT GODS MOST DREADED INSTRUMENT IN WORKING OUT A PURE INTENT IS MANARRAYED FOR MUTUAL SLAUGHTER YEA CARNAGE IS HIS DAUGHTER AND TO THE SAME PURPOSE WRITES FLETCHER OH GREAT CORRECTOR OF ENORMOUS TIMES SHAKER OF OERRANK STATESTHAT HEALST WITH BLOOD THE EARTH WHEN IT IS SICK AND YET THE TIME OF WARS IS PAST WE STILL HAVE THEM OF COURSE AND WE STILL HAVE A WARPROPAGANDA BUT IT WOULD BE EASY TO SHOW THAT THESE WARS ARE NEVER MILITARY BUT ALWAYS COMMERCIALTHAT WHEN TWO CIVILISED STATES FIGHT NOWADAYS IT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY EXPECT TO SUBJUGATE EACH OTHER OR DESIRE TO BUT BECAUSE THEIR CAPITALISTS BOTH NEED THE SAME FOREIGN MARKET I AM ACQUAINTED WITH ONLY ONE WRITER OF ANY STANDING IN THE UNITED STATES CAPTAIN MAHAN WHO IS NOWADAYS WILLING EVEN TO HINT THAT WARS MAY STILL BE NECESSARY TO THE DISCIPLINING OF A NATION AND I THINK ONE MIGHT ASSERT WITHOUT FEAR OF CONTRADICTION THAT PEOPLE NOW GO TO WAR NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE PERSUADED THEY HAVE TO AND THAT RIGHTTHINKING MEN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD KNOW THAT A WAR IS A NATIONAL CALAMITY A CAUSE OF EVILS INNUMERABLE SCARCELY EVER OVERBALANCED BY GOOD AND IT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO NOTICE HOW THIS HAS BEEN DONE HOW IT IS THAT THE MILITARY IDEAL IS UNIVERSALLY DISCREDITED IN THE WORLD IT HAS NOT BEEN DUE TO THE PREACHINGS OF MORALISTS AND ENTHUSIASTS IT HAS NOT BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE INTERVENTION OF ANY DEUS EX MACHINA IT HAS COME ABOUT IN THE PERFECTLY INEVITABLE COURSE OF NATURE NO HERO HAS ARISEN TO SLAY THE DEMON OF WARTHE DEMON OF WAR HAS SLAIN HIMSELF IT IS SIMPLY THAT THE WORK OF WAR IS DONE IT IS SIMPLY THAT WAR HAS BROUGHT ABOUT A SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST AND THAT THERE IS NO MORE NEED OF CONQUEST AND NO POSSIBILITY OF IT THE PEOPLES HAVE GONE ON TO A DIFFERENT LIFE THEY HAVE ALMOST FORGOTTEN FOR THOUGHT OF CONQUERING OR OF BEING CONQUERED THEY KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT THEY KNOW THAT THEIR SOCIAL ORGANISM IS OF TOO DELICATE A TYPE TO STAND IT THEY CAN NO MORE STAND IT THAN ONE OF OUR MODERN CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY COULD STAND THE SHOCK OF JOUSTING WITH RICHARD CUR DE LION WE HAVE MOVED ON TO ANOTHER KIND OF STRUGGLETO THE KIND WHICH IS KNOWN AS INDUSTRIAL COMPETITION AND WE ARE TO COME TO THE END OF THAT IN PRECISELY THE SAME WAY WE ARE TO SEE THE FITTEST SURVIVE AND GROW AND ESTABLISH THEMSELVES IMPREGNABLY AND SO LONG AS THERE IS ROOM FOR COMPETITION THEY WILL COMPETE AND WHEN THEY FIND THERE IS NO LONGER ROOM FOR COMPETITION THAT BY CONTINUING IT THEY ARE DOING AS MUCH HARM TO THEMSELVES AS TO THEIR RIVALS THEY WILL PUT AN END TO COMPETITION AND NO POWER ON EARTH CAN PREVENT THEIR PUTTING AN END TO IT ANY POWER WHICH REALLY TRIED TO PREVENT THEIR PUTTING AN END TO IT WOULD SIMPLY DESTROY THEM AS TWO CIVILISED NATIONS WOULD BE DESTROYED IF THEY COULD BE COMPELLED TO KEEP ON MAKING WAR AGAINST EACH OTHER THE GREAT TASK OF CIVILISATION IS THE LEADING OF MEN TO RECOGNISE WHEN THESE MIGHTY CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE FOR SO FAR I HAVE SPOKEN OF ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS I HAVE SHOWN THE VICTORYBUT THERE ARE ALSO DEFEATS SOMETIMES IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND HIS ENVIRONMENT IT IS THE ENVIRONMENT THAT CONQUERS SOMETIMES THE MAN OR THE SOCIETY IS NOT EQUAL TO THE NEW TASK AND FALLS BACK AND THE LAW OF THIS IS DEATH THE STAG WHICH CAN RUN SWIFTLY ENOUGH ESCAPES AND IS ABLE TO RUN ALL THE MORE SWIFTLY AS THE RESULT OF THE RACE THE STAG WHICH CANNOT RUN QUITE SWIFTLY ENOUGH BECOMES VENISON THE TINY SHOOT WHICH CAN GROW HIGH ENOUGH FINDS THE LIGHT AND BECOMES A MIGHTY TREE ITS NEIGHBOUR WHICH COULD NOT GROW QUITE SO HIGH TURNS TO MOULD THERE COMES NOW AND THEN IN THE HISTORY OF EVERY LIVING THING SOME MOMENT WHEN ITS FUTURE HANGS IN THE BALANCE WHEN IT SUMMONS ALL ITS FORCES AND LIVES OR DIES THE BUTTERFLY FACES SUCH A CRISIS WHEN IT EMERGES FROM THE CHRYSALIS THE CHILD WHEN IT IS BORN YOU HAVE KNOWN SUCH FATEFUL HOURS IN YOUR OWN MORAL LIFE AND YOU CAN GO THROUGH HISTORY AND PUT YOUR FINGER UPON THEMHERE WHEN THE GREEKS DROVE BACK THE PERSIANS HERE WHEN THE FRANKS DROVE BACK THE SARACENS HERE ON THE FIELD OF WATERLOO ON THE HILLS OF GETTYSBURG YOU WOULD LIKE TO STAY AS YOU ARE OF COURSE FOR THAT IS THE LEAST TROUBLE YOU HAVE YOUR ROUTINE AND YOUR HABITS YOUR OLD WELLWORN PATHS IN WHICH YOUR THOUGHTS MOVEYOU WOULD LIKE TO STAY AS YOU ARE BUT THE CURSE OF LIFE IS UPON YOUYOU CANNOT STAY AS YOU ARE YOU HAVE TO GO FORWARD OR ELSE TO GO BACK WHEN THE CRISIS COMES THERE IS NO ESCAPING ITIT COMES WHEN THE BIRTHPANGS BEGIN EITHER THE CHILD IS BORN OR THE MOTHER DIES WHEN THE THROES OF REVOLUTION SEIZE A NATION EITHER THE OLD FORMS ARE SHATTERED OR THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE IS CRUSHED THERE WAS ONCE A REFORMATION AND A REVOLUTION IN FRANCE THERE WAS NO REFORMATION AND NO REVOLUTION IN SPAIN SO IN ONE CASE YOU HAVE NEW LIFE AND ABOUNDING VIGOURLITERATURES AND PHILOSOPHIES AND SCIENCES AND IMPULSE AFTER IMPULSE WITHOUT END AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE STAGNATION AND RUIN THE TASK WAS SIMPLY TOO HARD FOR THE SPANISH NATION THEY HAD LIVED FOR CENTURIES IN IMMINENT PROXIMITY TO AN ENEMY OF AN ALIEN FAITH AND THE RESULT WAS THE FASTENING UPON THE PEOPLE OF A SYSTEM OF MILITARY DESPOTISM AND RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY AND WHEN THE DANGER WAS BY WHEN THE WORK OF THESE FORCES WAS DONE AND THE TIME CAME FOR THE PEOPLE OF SPAIN TO THROW THEM OFF THEIR EFFORTS WERE OF NO AVAIL THEIR KINGS AND THEIR PRIESTS TORTURED THEM AND BURNED THEM AT THE STAKE AND SO THE IMPULSE DIED AND NEVER AFTERWARDS DID THEY LIFT THEIR HEADS IN THE SAME WAY CONSIDER THE NEGRO QUESTION AS WE HAVE IT IN THE UNITED STATES HERE ALSO WE ARE DEALING WITH A DEFEATED RACE A RACE WHICH WAS BRED WHERE NATURE PROVED TOO STRONG FOR MANWHERE SAVAGE BEASTS FELL UPON HIM AND DEADLY DISEASES SMOTE HIM AND THE SWIFT POWERS OF THE JUNGLE BALKED HIS EVERY EFFORT TO RISE SO FOR CENTURIES AND AGES HE WAS TRAMPLED UPON AND CRUSHED UNTIL EVERY SPARK OF GENIUS WAS EXTINGUISHED IN HIM AND NOW WE STRIVE WITH ALL THE RESOURCES OF OUR CIVILISATIONOUR NOBLEST AND BEST HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES TO THE TASK AND WE DO NOT KNOW YET IF WE ARE TO WIN OR LOSE LET THE READER OF THIS BOOK GET A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING UPON AT LEAST ONE POINTTHAT NO SOCIALIST EXPECTS TO ABOLISH COMPETITION AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST ALL THAT ANY SOCIALIST EXPECTS TO DO IS TO CHANGE THE KIND OF COMPETITION AND THE STANDARD OF THE FITNESS THE PURPOSE OF INDUSTRIAL COMPETITION IS TO RAISE UP THE INDUSTRIALLY FIT AND TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM FOR THE FEEDING AND CLOTHING OF MEN THE SIGN THAT THE FORMER TASK IS DONE IS THE OUTCRY AGAINST THE MONEYMADNESS OF THE TIME THE SIGN THAT THE LATTER IS DONE IS OVERPRODUCTION AND THE TRUST THE PURPOSE OF THIS LITTLE BOOK IS TO LAY BEFORE CANDID AND TRUTHSEEKING AMERICANS THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE WHICH EXISTS OF THE FACT THAT INDUSTRIAL COMPETITION AS AN EVOLUTIONARY FORCE HAS DONE ITS WORK IN OUR SOCIETY THAT IT HAS DISCIPLINED OUR LABOURERS IN DILIGENCE AND SKILL AND OUR LEADERS IN FORESIGHT ENTERPRISE AND ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY THAT IT HAS BUILT US UP A MACHINE FOR THE SATISFYING OF ALL THE MATERIAL NEEDS OF CIVILISATION A MACHINE THAT HAS ONLY TO BE USED AND THAT UNTIL WE HAVE FOUND OUT HOW TO USE IT OUR NATIONAL LIFE MUST REMAIN AT A STANDSTILL STAGNATION MUST TAKE THE PLACE OF PROGRESS AND IN EVERY PORTION OF OUR BODY POLITIC THE SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE AND DECAY MUST MULTIPLY AND GROW MORE AND MORE ALARMING WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO THINK THAT THE INSTITUTIONS OF FREEDOM IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SO SECURE THAT WE MAY GO ABOUT OUR BUSINESS AND OUR PLAY AND LEAVE THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND YET ETERNAL VIGILANCE IS THE PRICE OF LIBERTY IS THE MOTTO OUR ANCESTORS LEFT US FOR THE FORMS OF TYRANNY CHANGE FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION AND IT IS ALWAYS OUT OF THE OLD FREEDOM THAT THE NEW SLAVERY IS MADE YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN STAY FREE BY CLINGING TO THE GOOD OLD WAYS BY REPEATING THE GOOD OLD FORMULAS BY STANDING BY THE GOOD OLD FAITHS BUT YOU CANNOT FOR FREEDOM IS NOT A THING OF INSTITUTIONS BUT OF THE SOUL IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDER THE FORMS OF SPIRITUALITY THAT MEN HAVE BEEN CHAINED BY PRIESTCRAFT AND IT IS WITH THE VERY PENNONS AND BANNERS OF LIBERTY THAT THIS LAND IS BOUND TODAY IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN SO AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE SOTHAT THE DESPOT ASKS NOTHING SAVE THAT THINGS SHOULD STAY AS THEY ARE WHAT WAS IT THAT THE SLAVEHOLDER WANTED BUT THAT THINGS SHOULD STAY AS THEY WERE THAT MEN SHOULD HOLD BY THE CONSTITUTION AS IT WAS WHILE AMERICA WAS MADE INTO A SLAVE EMPIRE WHAT IS IT THAT OUR MASTERS WANT TODAY SAVE THAT WE SHOULD STAND BY THE GOOD OLD TRADITIONS OF AMERICAN INDIVIDUALISM FREEDOM OF CONTRACT AND THE RIGHT OF EVERY MAN TO MANAGE HIS OWN BUSINESS AS HE PLEASESTHE WHILE THE REPUBLIC OF JEFFERSON AND LINCOLN IS FORGED INTO A WEAPON FOR THE ENSLAVING OF MANKIND THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE TRADITION OF THE EARLY TIMES THAT IS NOT BEING USED TODAY FOR THE BETRAYING OF LIBERTY TAKE THE MONROE DOCTRINE FOR INSTANCE WE SHOUT FOR IT EVERY FOURTH OF JULY AND WE ARE RUSHING TO COMPLETION A SCORE OR TWO OF BATTLESHIPS TO DEFEND IT WHENEVER IT IS IN PERIL OUR MOST RABID ANTITRUST EDITORS AND POLITICIANS DROP EVERYTHING AND TAKE TO SINGING YANKEE DOODLE AND YET HAS NEVER THE LEAST SUSPICION ABOUT IT COME TO YOU HAS IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU TO LOOK WHO IT IS THAT IS LEADING YOU UPON THIS CRUSADE OF FREEDOMTHIS STRANGE PROPAGANDA OF CIVILISATION AND REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS BY BATTLESHIP AND RAPIDFIRING GUN THIS ZEAL OF OUR CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY FOR THE SPREAD OF AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS AMONG THE FILIPINOS AND HAWAIIANS AND PORTO RICANS AND PANAMANIANS AND VENEZUELANS THE WHILE THEY ARE SO BUSY CRUSHING AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS IN RHODE ISLAND AND COLORADO THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN ALL THE DESPOTISMS OF EUROPE WERE BANDED TOGETHER TO DESTROY REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS AND WHEN THE THREATENING GESTURE OF THIS YOUNG REPUBLIC HELD THEM BACK FROM HALF A WORLD AND THUS BRAVELY WE GUARDED CIVILISATION WITH OUR MONROE DOCTRINE UNTIL THE LESSON OF FREEDOM HAD BEEN LEARNED BUT NOW TIME HAS PASSED AND WE HAVE COME TO A NEW AGE WITH NEW PERILS AND NEW DUTIES THERE IS A NEW KIND OF SLAVERY IN THE WORLD AND A KIND IN WHICH WE LEAD ALL CIVILISATION THE CONTROL OF OUR REPUBLIC HAS PASSED OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE BY FRAUD AND FORCE OUR LIBERTIES HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWNTHE VERY WORD HAS BEEN RELEGATED TO SCHOOLBOY ORATIONS AND GRAND ARMY REUNIONS AND BY THIS NEW DESPOTISM OF GREED THE PEOPLE HAVE FIRST BEEN PLUNDERED AND CRUSHED AND NOW ARE TO BE MARSHALLED AND LED OUT TO DO BATTLE WITH OTHER PEOPLES SIMILARLY BEGUILED IN THIS WORK EVERY FORCE OF REACTION AND CONSERVATISM IN CIVILISED SOCIETY IS NOW ENLISTED EVERY TRADITION OF OLDEN TIME HAS BEEN CALLED INTO SERVICE NO PRETENCE IS TOO HOLLOW NO BLASPHEMY TOO ABOMINABLE TO BE EMPLOYED EVERY NATIONAL PREJUDICE EVERY RACIAL HATRED EVERY RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY IS MADE USE OFAND THE STARVING WRETCHES OF THE SLUMS AND GUTTERS OF LONDON ARE SENT INTO SOUTH AFRICA TO CAPTURE DIAMOND MINES FOR THE GLORY OF FREE BRITANNIA WHILE THE HELPLESS PEASANTS OF RUSSIA ARE LED OUT WITH JEWELLED IMAGES OF THE VIRGIN IN FRONT OF THEM TO STEAL MANCHURIA IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST IT IS WITH GERMANY THAT WE AMERICANS ARE SCHEDULED TO BATTLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE MONROE DOCTRINE AND WHAT IS THE SITUATION IN GERMANY THERE IS FIRST OF ALL THE DEGENERATE WHO SITS UPON ITS THRONE AND PROCLAIMS HIMSELF BY GRACE OF GOD THE LORD AND MASTER OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE THERE IS IN THE SECOND PLACE THE HIDEBOUND MEDIVAL NOBILITY OF THE EMPIRE THE DIRECT DESCENDANTS OF THOSE ROBBERKNIGHTS OF WHOM WE READ A WHILE AGO SOME OF THEM LIVING IN THE VERY SAME CASTLES FROM WHICH THEIR ANCESTORS MADE THEIR RAIDS THERE IS IN THE THIRD PLACE THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE ARMY WHOSE INSOLENT AND DISSOLUTE OFFICERS BEAT KICK AND MAIM THE HELPLESS COUNTRY BOYS AND ARTISANS WHO ARE HERDED LIKE SHEEP UNDER THEIR COMMAND THERE IS IN THE FOURTH PLACE THE BIGOTED SEVENTEENTHCENTURY PROTESTANT CHURCH WITH ITS SNUFFY COUNTRY PARSONS AND DOCTORS OF DUSTY DIVINITY THERE IS IN THE FIFTH PLACE THE MEDIVAL ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH WITH ITS CONFESSIONAL AND OTHER AGENCIES OF DARKNESS THERE IS IN THE SIXTH PLACE A SUBSIDISED REPTILE PRESS WHOSE OPINIONS ARE WRITTEN AND WHOSE NEWS IS GARBLED BY KNAVISH BUREAU OFFICIALS AND EVERY ONE OF THESE POWERS FORGETTING ALL PAST DIFFERENCES AND UNITING WITH BROTHERLY AFFECTION ARE STRUGGLING WITH EVERY PREJUDICE THEY CAN APPEAL TO AND EVERY THREAT WHICH THEY CAN WIELD TO HOLD THE GERMAN PEOPLE SUBJECT TO THE IDENTICAL SAME SYSTEM THAT RULES IN AMERICA THE INDUSTRIAL ARISTOCRACY OF CUNNING AND GREED IS WORKING THEM UPON STARVATION WAGES AT HOME AND DRIVING THEM TO SERVE IN ARMIES AND NAVIES TO CONQUER MARKETS ABROAD TO THREATEN DEWEY AT MANILA AND TO SEIZE CHINESE PORTS AND CONDUCT PUNITIVE EXPEDITIONS AGAINST CHINAMEN TO SELL BAD WHISKEY AND FIREARMS TO HEREROS AND THEN SLAUGHTER THEM WHEN THEY REBEL TO BLOCKADE PORTS IN VENEZUELA AND TO SINK PIRATES IN THE WEST INDIES AND TO SOUND AND MEASURE CHANNELS AS A PRELIMINARY TO THE TAKING OF A NAVAL BASE AND THE INAUGURATION OF A WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES BUT THEN YOU SAY WE CANT HELP THAT WHAT CAN WE DO IS THE ONLY THING YOU CAN THINK OF TO DO TO BUILD BATTLESHIPS AND GET READY FOR THE STRIFE HOW DIFFERENTLY OUR FATHERS DID IT IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN THE MONROE DOCTRINE WAS REALLY WHAT IT PRETENDS TO BEA PLEDGE OF FREEDOM TO MEN HOW THE IMPULSES THAT STARTED IN THIS LAND THRILLED THROUGH THE CIVILISED WORLD AND MADE THE DESPOTS OF EUROPE TREMBLE WHAT MESSAGES OF BROTHERHOOD FLASHED UPON INVISIBLE WIRES FROM CONTINENT TO CONTINENT BEARING HOPE AND COMFORT TO ALL THE OPPRESSED OF MANKIND HOW WE WELCOMED LAFAYETTE AS IF HE HAD BEEN AN EMPEROR HOW THE WHOLE NATION TURNED OUT IN HONOUR OF KOSSUTH MAKING HIS LONG JOURNEY ONE TRIUMPHAL PROCESSION AND ARE WE DOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT NOW THE PEOPLE OF GERMANY YOU MUST UNDERSTAND ARE CLOSED IN A DEATH GRIP WITH ALL THESE POWERS OF INFAMY IN SPITE OF OBLOQUY AND CONTEMPT IN SPITE OF LIES AND BLANDISHMENTS AND MENACES IN SPITE OF PERSECUTION AND EXILE AND IMPRISONMENT FOR A GENERATION THEY HAVE BEEN TOILINGDEVOTED HEROIC MEN AND WOMEN HAVE GIVEN THEIR LABOUR AND THEIR LIVES TO THE TASK OF TEACHING WRITING SPEAKING EXHORTING TO OPEN THE EYES OF THE MASSES TO THE TRUTH AND STEP BY STEP THEY HAVE MARCHED ON GATHERING FORCE EVERY HOUR STRENGTHENED BY EACH NEW PERSECUTION TRAINING THEMSELVES IN LITERARY AND POLITICAL COMBAT BUILDING UP A SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN REFUTED AND NEVER CAN BE INSPIRED BY A MORAL PURPOSE AS NOBLE AS ANY THE WORLD HAS EVER SEENPREPARING IN ALL WAYS FOR THE GLORIOUS HOUR WHEN THE PEOPLE OF THE FATHERLAND ARE TO COME TO THEIR OWN THE MAN AT THEIR HEAD WAS ONCE A POOR WORKING BOY A WHEELWRIGHT AND HE HAS RAISED HIMSELF TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MIGHTIEST EFFORT AFTER FREEDOM THAT THE WORLD NOW SEES AND DAY BY DAY IN THE REICHSTAG HE LEADS THE OPPOSITION TO MILITARISM AND SAVAGERY AND HIS SPEECHES ARE SUCH AS A CENTURY AGO AND EVEN HALF A CENTURY AGO WOULD HAVE SET THIS LAND AFLAME FROM END TO END WITH REVOLUTIONARY FERVOUR AND THIS IS NO ISOLATED MOVEMENT OF A NATION IT IS A WORLD MOVEMENTIT IS A MOVEMENT TO WHICH THE LOVERS OF LIBERTY ALL OVER THE EARTH ARE WELCOMED AS COMRADES AND BROTHERS IT IS A MOVEMENT AT ONE WITH EVERY HIGH TRADITION OF AMERICAN LIFE AND YOUWHAT IS YOUR ATTITUDE TO IT WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ITWHAT DO YOU CARE ABOUT IT DO YOU HOLD PUBLIC MEETINGS AND SEND MESSAGES OF SYMPATHY DO THE HALLS OF CONGRESS RING WITH FERVID SPEECHES AS THEY DID IN THE DAYS OF WEBSTER AND HENRY CLAY DO YOUR PAPERS TEEM WITH GLOWING EDITORIALS WITH NEWS ABOUT THE MOVEMENT AND SKETCHES OF ITS LEADERS WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY ABOUT IT WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO FOR ITBUT TO REPEAT DAY IN AND DAY OUT ONE MISERABLE PITIFUL LIE WITH WHICH YOU TRY TO BLIND AND DECEIVE THE MASSES OF YOUR OWN COUNTRY THAT THIS TREMENDOUS SOCIALIST MOVEMENT IS NOT REALLY A SOCIALIST MOVEMENT AT ALL BUT ONLY A MOVEMENT OF POLITICAL REFORM I DO NOT THINK THAT WE SHALL SLEEP FOREVER I DO NOT THINK THAT THE MEMORIES OF JEFFERSON AND LINCOLN WILL CALL TO US IN VAIN FOREVER BUT ASSUREDLY THERE NEVER WAS IN ALL AMERICAN HISTORY A SIGN OF TORPOR SO DEEP OF DEGENERATION SO FRIGHTFUL AS THIS FACT THAT IN SUCH A CRISIS WHEN THE DOWNTRODDEN MILLIONS OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE ARE STRUGGLING TO FREE THEMSELVES FROM THE TYRANNY OF MILITARY AND PERSONAL GOVERNMENT THERE SHOULD COME TO THEM NOT ONE BREATH OF SYMPATHY FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC AND ALL OUR INTEREST ALL OUR ATTENTION IS FOR THAT STRUTTING TURKEYCOCK THE WARLORD WHOSE MAILED FIST HOLDS THEM DOWN THAT MONSTROUS CREATURE WITH HIS INSANE EGOTISM HIS BLUSTERING AND HIS SWAGGERING HIS CURLED MUSTACHIOS AND MILITARY POSES AN EPILEPTIC DEGENERATE WHO SPENDS HIS WHOLE LIFE IN CRINGING TERROR OF HEREDITARY INSANITY WHOSE SPIES AND POLICE AGENTS ARE INVADING THE HOMES OF GERMAN SOCIALISTS SEARCHING FOR LETTERS IN BEHALF OF THE AGENTS OF THE CZAR OBTAINING EVIDENCE TO SEND MEN IN RUSSIA TO EXILE AND DEATH THIS RULER OF HIS PEOPLE WHO THE OTHER DAY CASHIERED A NEAR RELATIVE AN ARMY OFFICER WHO HAD ADVISED SOLDIERS TO COMPLAIN WHEN THEY WERE MALTREATED WHOSE GENERALS AND ADMIRALS ARE SWAGGERING ABOUT AND SPITTING IN THE FACE OF CIVILISATIONAND MAKING MAPS AND PLANS FOR A NAVAL STATION IN DEFIANCE OF THE MONROE DOCTRINE FORTY YEARS AGO AT THE TIME OF OUR CIVIL WAR WHEN THE FATE OF THIS NATION HUNG TREMBLING IN THE BALANCE WHEN THE EMPEROR OF FRANCE AND THE ARISTOCRACY OF ENGLAND SAW A CHANCE TO CRIPPLE REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT AND TO SET BACK CIVILISATION HALF A CENTURYWHAT WAS IT THEN THAT PREVENTED THEM WHAT WAS IT BUT THE FACT THAT IN ENGLAND THERE EXISTED AN ORGANISED OPPOSITION ALERT AND WATCHFUL TRAINED BY A GENERATION OF PARLIAMENTARY CONFLICT AND WITH LEADERS WHO IN SUCH A CRISIS COULD NOT BE PUT DOWN WHAT WAS IT BUT THE FACT THAT THE WORKERS OF THE FACTORY TOWNS OF GREAT BRITAIN HAD BEEN DISCIPLINED AND TAUGHT AND COULD NOT BE DECEIVEDTHAT THEY CHOSE RATHER TO STARVE THAN TO HELP THE CAUSE OF SLAVERY AND IF YOU CARE TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD NOT THAT OPPOSITION BEEN READY GO BACK THREE OR FOURSCORE YEARS WHEN THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE STRUCK THEIR BLOW FOR LIBERTY AND SEE THE LEADERS OF THE BRITISH ARISTOCRACY CRUSHING OUT PROTEST AND IMPRISONING OBJECTORS AND HURLING THE NATION INTO A CRIMINAL AND CAUSELESS WAR HEAR THE KING AND THE NOBILITY STATESMEN AND AUTHORS NEWSPAPERS AND PULPITS SCREAMING IN FRENZY AND GOADING THE PEOPLE ON TILL THEY HAD DESOLATED EUROPE WITH FIFTEEN YEARS OF HIDEOUS SLAUGHTER FROM THE MORAL AND SPIRITUAL EFFECTS OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NOT YET RECOVERED AND NOW YOU STAND AND CONTEMPLATE ANOTHER SUCH CRIME AGAINST CIVILISATION THE TWO MOST ENLIGHTENED PEOPLES OF THE WORLD ARE TO COME TOGETHER AND STRIP FOR A FIGHT THE POWERS THAT RULE IN EACH OF THEM MADE UP THEIR MINDS YEARS AGO AND AMONG THE OFFICERS BOTH IN THE ARMY AND IN THE NAVY OF EACH THE COMING CONFLICT IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO A GERMAN OFFICER PROMISED THAT AN ARMY CORPS WOULD MARCH FROM ONE END OF THIS CONTINENT TO THE OTHER AND AN ADMIRAL IN OUR OWN NAVY HAS PUBLICLY FORETOLD THE STRUGGLE THE GERMAN CAPITALISTS ARE IN DESPERATION FOR NEW MARKETS AND THE GERMAN PEOPLE ARE ON THE EDGE OF A REVOLT WITH AN IRRESPONSIBLE MILITARY DESPOT IN ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF THEM WHO KNOWS THAT HIS ONLY CHANCE TO PUT OFF THE REVOLUTION IS TO PICK A QUARREL AND BEAT THE WARDRUM AND SUMMON THE MASSES TO THE DEFENCE OF THE HONOUR OF THE FATHERLAND WHEN THAT SUPREME HOUR COMES AND WHEN THE WARLUST BEGINS TO BURN UPON THE SOCIALDEMOCRATIC PARTY OF GERMANY WILL FALL THE TASK OF SAVING CIVILISATION AND WHAT SHALL WE HAVE DONE TO HELP THEMWHAT ENCOURAGEMENT SHALL WE HAVE SENT THEM WE HAVE SENT SHIPS OF GRAIN TO THE COTTONOPERATIVES OF LANCASHIRE WHEN THEY WERE STARVING BUT WHAT HAVE WE DONE FOR THE PEOPLE OF GERMANY WHAT REASON HAVE WE GIVEN THEM WITH OUR TARIFFS AND IMPERIALISMS TO THINK OF US OTHERWISE THAN AS A NATION OF SHOPKEEPERS A NATION SUNK IN GREED AND COMMERCIALISM AND DEAD TO EVERY NOBLE IMPULSE OF MEN CHAPTER III MARKETS AND MISERY I GAVE IN THE FIRST CHAPTER A BRIEF OUTLINE OF MY VIEW OF THE PROCESS OF WEALTHCONCENTRATION IT IS NOW TIME TO CONSIDER THE PRESENT STATUS OF AFFAIRS AND DETERMINE IF WE CAN EXACTLY HOW NEAR TO COMPLETION OUR INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY HAS COME BECAUSE OF THE VITAL PART WHICH THE QUESTION OF FOREIGN MARKETS HAS PLAYED AND MUST PLAY IN OUR AFFAIRS IT IS NECESSARY THAT THIS INQUIRY SHOULD INCLUDE A CAREFUL SURVEY OF CONDITIONS IN THE REST OF THE WORLD THE MANUFACTURES OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE GROWN FROM ONE HUNDRED AND NINETYEIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN TO FIVE BILLION IN AND THIRTEEN BILLION IN OUR EXPORTS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES INCREASED FROM SIXTYSIX MILLION DOLLARS IN TO EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTYSIX MILLION IN AND A BILLION AND HALF IN OF COURSE IF WE COULD FIND UNLIMITED MARKETS ABROAD WE MIGHT GO ON FOR HALF A CENTURY OR AT LEAST UNTIL OUR PEOPLE GREW TIRED OF DOING HARD WORK FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD AND GETTING IN RETURN EITHER BAD DEBTS OR ELSE MONEY TO BE USED IN BUILDING NEW MACHINES TO DO MORE WORK OF THE SAME SORT BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE AS IT HAPPENS THERE ARE HALF A DOZEN NATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILDING UP INDUSTRIAL MACHINES OF THEIR OWN AND HAVE COMPLETED THEM THE MEANING OF THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENTS OF ENGLAND AND GERMANY AND FRANCE AND BELGIUM AND ITALY IS SIMPLY THAT ALL THESE NATIONS ARE NOW ABLE TO MANUFACTURE MORE THAN THEIR OWN PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO BUY UNDER THE OLD DEADLY COMBINATION OF A MONOPOLY PRICE AND A COMPETITIVE WAGE AND SO WHEN WE GO OVER TO EUROPE TO LOOK FOR MARKETS WE MEET PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OVER TO LOOK FOR MARKETS AMONG US AND WHEN IN OUR DESPERATION WE BEGIN TO SELL OUT AT ANY COST THE GERMAN CAPITALIST CRIES OUT IN PROTEST AND THE GERMAN WORKINGMEN ARE THROWN ON THE STREETS AND THE GERMAN SOCIALISTS INCREASE THEIR VOTE AND WHEN THE GERMAN CAPITALIST RETALIATES AND SELLS OUT AT COST OUR CAPITALISTS ARE CHECKED AND OUR MILLS ARE STOPPEDAND OUR SOCIALIST VOTE GOES UP LOOK AT THE FIGURES ENGLAND WAS THE FIRST IN THE FIELD THE OUTPUT OF COAL OF GREAT BRITAIN WAS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN IT WAS SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTYFIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN IN THE SAME PERIOD THE EXPORTS OF MANUFACTURES ROSE FROM TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS ALL THAT WHILE OF COURSE ENGLAND RULED THE SEA AND HAD THINGS HER OWN WAY IN THE VALUE OF ALL HER MANUFACTURES WAS ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARSEQUAL TO THAT OF GERMANY AND AUSTRIA COMBINED OR TO FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES COMBINED OR TO ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD EXCLUDING THESE FOUR NATIONS BUT THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE THE OTHERS BEGAN TO CATCH UP WITH HER IN INSTEAD OF MANUFACTURING ONEFOURTH OF THE WORLDS PRODUCTS GREAT BRITAIN MANUFACTURED ONEFIFTH AND IN SHE MANUFACTURED LESS THAN ONESIXTH BETWEEN THE YEARS AND BRITISH EXPORTS INCREASED ONLY THIRTEEN PER CENT WHILE THOSE OF FRANCE INCREASED SIXTEEN PER CENT THOSE OF GERMANY THIRTYNINE PER CENT AND THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES SIXTYSIX PER CENT THE RESULT WAS THAT A FEW YEARS AGO TENS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STARVING MEN WERE PARADING THE STREETS OF LONDON AND ALL ENGLAND WAS STARTLED BY MR CHAMBERLAINS ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE LAST HOPE OF ENGLAND WAS A TARIFF WHICH WOULD RESERVE FOR HER THE TRADE OF THE COLONIES OF COURSE ENGLAND COULD NOT HAVE MADE MONEY BY A TARIFF UNLESS HER COLONIES HAD CONSENTED TO LOSE MONEY AND THE COLONIES WERE NOT PLANNING TO LOSE MONEYTHEY WERE COUNTING ON MAKING SOME BY ENGLANDS TAX ON FOOD SO THE PLAN SIMPLY REDUCED ITSELF TO AN INVITATION TO THE BRITISH WORKINGMAN TO PAY MORE FOR HIS BREAD SO THAT HE COULD GET STARVATION WAGES FOR DOING THE MANUFACTURING OF CANADA AND AUSTRALIA AND INDIA IS IT ANY WONDER THAT THE REPLY TO THE PROPOSAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN INDEPENDENT LABOUR VOTE WHICH SENT A THRILL OF ALARM THROUGH THE NATION AND MEANWHILE CANADA AND AUSTRALIA AND INDIA ARE STRAINING EVERY NERVE TO BUILD UP MANUFACTURES OF THEIR OWN NO PERSON CONNECTED WITH THE COTTON INDUSTRY CAN BE IGNORANT OF THE PROGRESS OF COTTON MANUFACTURES IN INDIA WROTE THE TEXTILE RECORDER IN INDIAN COTTON PIECEGOODS ARE COMING TO THE FRONT AND DISPLACING THOSE OF MANCHESTER THE BOMBAY FACTORY COMMISSION OF THE SAME YEAR RECORDED IN PARLIAMENT HOW THIS WAS BEING DONE THE FACTORY ENGINES ARE AT WORK AS A RULE FROM A M TO AND P M IN BUSY TIMES IT HAPPENS THAT THE SAME SET OF WORKERS REMAIN AT THE GINS AND PRESSES NIGHT AND DAY WITH HALF AN HOURS REST IN THE EVENINGS AND LIKE INDIA CANADA ALSO PUTS DUTIES ON BRITISH GOODS TO PROTECT HER OWN GROWING INDUSTRIES MEANWHILE ALSO THE REST OF THE WORLD IS HARD AT WORK LET US CONTINUE VIEWING THAT SAME INDUSTRY OF COTTONSPINNING THE VALUE OF THE MANUFACTUREDCOTTON PRODUCT OF AUSTRIA HAS GROWN FROM FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TO THIRTYFIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN AND NINETY MILLIONS IN THE TEXTILE MANUFACTURES OF BELGIUM TREBLED THEMSELVES IN THREE YEARS PREVIOUS TO THOSE OF GERMANY HAVE INCREASED TWENTYFOLD IN SIXTY YEARS THOSE OF ITALY NINEFOLD IN TWENTY YEARS WHILE EVEN SUCH BACKWARD COUNTRIES AS RUSSIA AND SPAIN HAVE DOUBLED THEIR TEXTILE INDUSTRIES ONE IN THIRTY THE OTHER IN TWENTY YEARS MOST UNEXPECTED AND DISCONCERTING OF ALL HOWEVER IS JAPAN WHO WAS ONCE LOOKED UPON AS A PERMANENT CUSTOMER BUT WHOSE HOME INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN GROWING LIKE A MAGIC PLANT THE TEXTILE MANUFACTURES OF JAPAN DOUBLED IN VALUE IN THE THREE YEARS BETWEEN AND FROM SIX MILLION POUNDS OF COTTON SPUN IN JAPAN ADVANCED TO NINETYONE MILLION IN AND TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTYTHREE MILLION IN IN NINE YEARS INCREASING TWENTYFOUR FOLD THE VALUE OF ALL HER TEXTILE PRODUCE WAS SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN AND IT WAS SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THEREFORE HER IMPORTS OF COTTON GOODS FROM EUROPE FELL FROM EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN TO FOUR MILLION IN AND WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON IN THE REST OF THE WORLD IN THE UNITED STATES THE VALUE OF MANUFACTURED COTTON WAS RISING FROM FORTYFIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TO TWO HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TO TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTYSEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN AND TO THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTYNINE MILLION IN UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IS IT ANY WONDER THAT AT THE OUTBREAK OF THE RUSSOJAPANESE WAR THE FACTORIES OF MASSACHUSETTS AND CANADA WERE RUNNING ON HALFTIME AND DOZENS NOT RUNNING AT ALL THAT BRITISH COTTON MANUFACTURERS FOUND THAT PRICES HAD DECREASED FIFTEEN PER CENT IN AS MANY YEARS THAT THE WEAVERS OF BELGIUM WERE STARVING AND THE COUNTRY WAS FULL OF RIOTS AND INSURRECTIONS AND THAT ALL THE NATIONS OF EUROPE WERE GATHERING IN THE FAR EAST LIKE VULTURES ABOUT A CARCASSKNOWING THAT THE SOLE CONDITION UPON WHICH ANY ONE OF THEM COULD MAINTAIN ITS INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL RGIME FOR ANOTHER DECADE WAS ITS ABILITY TO SECURE THE CUSTOM OF SOME HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF CHINAMEN WHO ARE SO POOR THAT A HANDFUL OF RICE AND A COTTON SHIRT ARE ALL THEY OWN IN THE WORLD I OFTEN WONDER WHAT OUR COLLEGE PRESIDENTS AND OTHER AFTERDINNER ECONOMISTS MAKE OF FACTS SUCH AS THESE THEY DO NOT DISCUSS THEM IN THEIR SPEECHES I AM ACQUAINTED WITH ONLY ONE MAN AMONG ALL OUR ORTHODOX ADVISERS WHO BELIEVES IN THE PERMANENCE OF THE COMPETITIVE RGIME AND AT THE SAME TIME REALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT IMPLIESWHO CARES FOR THE TRUTH FOLLOWS HIS VIEWS TO THEIR CONCLUSIONS AND THEN SPEAKS THE CONCLUSIONS WHEN I FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH THIS GENTLEMANINTELLECTUALLY ACQUAINTED THAT ISIT AFFECTED ME PAINFULLY AND EVEN NOW THE SIGHT OF HIS BOOK GIVES ME INTERNAL SENSATIONS AKIN TO THOSE OF A MAN IN AN ASCENDING ELEVATOR WHICH COMES TO A SUDDEN HALT THE BOOK IS THE NEW EMPIRE AND THE AUTHOR IS MR BROOKS ADAMS HE WRITES COLDLY AND DISPASSIONATELY AND WITH THE CERTAINTY OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE WHOSE CONCLUSIONS MAY NOT BE DISPUTED HIS STYLE IS CHARACTERISTIC IT IS BRIEF AND TO THE POINT AND THERE ARE NO APOLOGIES MR ADAMS IS THE APOSTLE OF COMPETITION HE EXPLAINS THAT HE IS THIS NOT FROM CHOICE BUT FROM NECESSITY VERY PROBABLY KEEN COMPETITION IS NOT A BLESSING WE CANNOT ALTER OUR ENVIRONMENT NATURE HAS CAST THE UNITED STATES INTO THE VORTEX OF THE FIERCEST STRUGGLE EVER KNOWN HIS THEORY OF LIFE MR ADAMS CONDENSES AS FOLLOWS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING A WORKING HYPOTHESIS IT IS ASSUMED THAT MEN ARE EVOLVED FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT LIKE OTHER ANIMALS AND THAT THEIR INTELLECTUAL MORAL AND SOCIAL QUALITIES MAY BE INVESTIGATED AS DEVELOPMENTS FROM THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE FOOD IS THE FIRST NECESSITY BUT AS MOST REGIONS PRODUCE FOOD MORE OR LESS ABUNDANTLY THE PINCH LIES NOT SO MUCH IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE FOOD ITSELF AS WITH ITS DISTRIBUTION TO SATISFY THEIR HUNGER MEN MUST NOT ONLY BE ABLE TO DEFEND THEIR OWN BUT IN CASE OF DEARTH TO ROB THEIR NEIGHBOURS WHERE THEY CANNOT BUY FOR THE WEAKER MUST PERISH LIFE MAY BE DESTROYED AS EFFECTUALLY BY PEACEFUL COMPETITION AS BY WAR A NATION WHICH IS UNDERSOLD MAY PERISH BY FAMINE AS COMPLETELY AS IF SLAUGHTERED BY A CONQUEROR FOR THESE REASONS MEN HAVE STRIVEN TO EQUIP THEMSELVES WELL FOR THE COMBAT AND SINCE THE END OF THE STONE AGE NO NATION IN THE MORE ACTIVE QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT A SUPPLY OF RELATIVELY CHEAP METAL THUS THE POSITION OF THE MINES HAS INFLUENCED THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL THE CENTRE OF THE MINERAL PRODUCTION IS LIKELY TO BE THE SEAT OF EMPIRE I BELIEVE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERESTIMATE THE EFFECT UPON CIVILISATION OF THE VARIATION OF TRADE ROUTES ACCORDING TO THE ANCIENT TRADITION THE WHOLE VALLEY OF THE SYRDARIA WAS ONCE SO THICKLY SETTLED THAT A NIGHTINGALE COULD FLY FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH OF DIFFERENT TREES AND A CAT WALK FROM WALL TO WALL AND FROM HOUSETOP TO HOUSETOP FROM KASHGAR TO THE SEA OF ARAL BUT THE TRADE ROUTE ACROSS CENTRAL ASIA WAS DISPLACED AND SO IT HAS COME TO PASS THAT BAGDAD HAS SUNK INTO A MASS OF HOVELS AND THE VALLEY OF SYRDARIA IS A WILDERNESS THE FATE OF THE EMPIRE OF HAROUNALRASCHID EXEMPLIFIES AN UNIVERSAL LAW THE GREATEST PRIZE OF MODERN TIMES IN MR ADAMSS OPINION IS NORTHERN CHINA AND UPON THIS THE FATE OF EMPIRE RESTS HIS BOOK WAS PUBLISHED IN AND HE CONSIDERED THEN THAT THE CHANCES WERE ALL WITH THE UNITED STATES TEN YEARS BEFORE WE HAD BEEN TOTTERING UPON THE BRINK OF RUIN RELIEF CAME THROUGH AN EXERTION OF ENERGY AND ADAPTABILITY PERHAPS WITHOUT A PARALLEL IN THREE YEARS AMERICA REORGANISED HER WHOLE SOCIAL SYSTEM BY A PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATION THE RESULT OF WHICH HAS BEEN THE SOCALLED TRUST BUT THE TRUST IS IN REALITY THE HIGHEST TYPE OF ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY AND THEREFORE OF ECONOMY WHICH HAS AS YET BEEN ATTAINED BY MEANS OF THIS CONSOLIDATION THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE ENABLED TO UTILISE THEIR MINES TO THE FULL THE SHOCK OF THE IMPACT OF THE NEW POWER SEEMS OVERWHELMING IN MARCH PITTSBURG ACHIEVED SUPREMACY IN STEEL AND IN AN INSTANT EUROPE FELT HERSELF POISED ABOVE AN ABYSS THE SPANISH EMPIRE DISINTEGRATED AND GREAT BRITAIN DISPLAYED A LASSITUDE WHICH HAS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE ENTIRE WORLD GERMANY HAS ALSO BEEN PERTURBED RUSSIA HAS HOWEVER SUFFERED MOST THE WORLD SEEMS AGREED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE IF INDEED SHE HAS NOT ALREADY ACHIEVED AN ECONOMIC SUPREMACY THE VORTEX OF THE CYCLONE IS NEAR NEW YORK NO SUCH ACTIVITY PREVAILS ELSEWHERE NOWHERE ARE UNDERTAKINGS SO GIGANTIC NOWHERE IS ADMINISTRATION SO PERFECT NOWHERE ARE SUCH MASSES OF CAPITAL CENTRALISED IN SINGLE HANDS AND AS THE UNITED STATES BECOMES AN IMPERIAL MARKET SHE STRETCHES OUT ALONG THE TRADE ROUTES WHICH LEAD FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO HER HEART AS EVERY EMPIRE HAS STRETCHED OUT FROM THE DAYS OF SARGON TO OUR OWN THE WEST INDIES DRIFT TOWARD US THE REPUBLIC OF MEXICO HARDLY LONGER HAS AN INDEPENDENT LIFE AND THE CITY OF MEXICO IS AN AMERICAN TOWN WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE PANAMA CANAL ALL CENTRAL AMERICA WILL BECOME A PART OF OUR SYSTEM WE HAVE EXPANDED INTO ASIA WE HAVE ATTRACTED THE FRAGMENTS OF THE SPANISH DOMINIONS AND REACHING OUT INTO CHINA WE HAVE CHECKED THE DEMANDS OF RUSSIA AND GERMANY IN TERRITORY WHICH UNTIL YESTERDAY HAD BEEN SUPPOSED TO BE BEYOND OUR SPHERE WE ARE PENETRATING EUROPE AND GREAT BRITAIN ESPECIALLY IS ASSUMING THE POSITION OF A DEPENDENCY WHICH MUST RELY UPON US AS THE BASE FROM WHICH SHE DRAWS HER FOOD IN PEACE AND WITHOUT WHICH SHE COULD NOT STAND IN WAR SUPPOSING THE MOVEMENT OF THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS ONLY EQUAL TO THAT OF THE LAST CONTINUES OUR AUTHOR THE UNITED STATES WILL OUTWEIGH ANY SINGLE EMPIRE IF NOT ALL EMPIRES COMBINED THE WHOLE WORLD WILL PAY HER TRIBUTE COMMERCE WILL FLOW TO HER BOTH FROM EAST AND WEST AND THE ORDER WHICH HAS EXISTED FROM THE DAWN OF TIME WILL BE REVERSED THERE IS ONLY ONE PERIL ABOUT ALL THIS IN THE OPINION OF MR ADAMS SOCIETY IS NOW MOVING WITH INTENSE VELOCITY AND MASSES ARE GATHERING BULK WITH PROPORTIONAL RAPIDITY THERE IS ALSO SOME REASON TO SURMISE THAT THE EQUILIBRIUM IS CORRESPONDINGLY DELICATE AND UNSTABLE IF SO APPARENTLY SLIGHT A CAUSE AS A FALL OF PRICES FOR A DECADE HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT TO PROPEL THE SEAT OF EMPIRE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC AN EQUALLY SLIGHT DERANGEMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES MIGHT FORCE IT ACROSS THE PACIFIC PRUDENCE THEREFORE WOULD DICTATE THE ADOPTION OF MEASURES TO MINIMISE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUDDEN SHOCKS IF THE NEW EMPIRE SHOULD DEVELOP IT MUST BE AN ENORMOUS COMPLEX MASS TO BE ADMINISTERED ONLY BY MEANS OF A CHEAP ELASTIC AND SIMPLE MACHINERY AN OLD AND CLUMSY MECHANISM MUST SOONER OR LATER COLLAPSE AND IN SINKING MAY INVOLVE A CIVILISATION BY AN OLD AND CLUMSY MECHANISM MR ADAMS EXPLAINS ELSEWHERE THAT HE MEANS OUR AMERICAN POLITICAL SYSTEM OUR ANCESTORS WERE OPPOSED TO MUCH CONSOLIDATION AND THEY FORMED A CONSTITUTION THAT WAS PRACTICALLY UNCHANGEABLE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THEY HAD REACHED CERTAIN FINAL TRUTHS OF GOVERNMENT THE LANGUAGE OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IN WHICH THEY PROCLAIMED ONE OF THESE TRUTHS THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL VARIES LITTLE FROM THAT OF A CATHOLIC COUNCIL SAYS MR ADAMS AN AMERICAN IS APT TO BELIEVE SUCH FORMULAS BEING DOMINATED BY TRADITION BUT A MODERN THINKER VIEWS THEM AS HAVING NO NECESSARY RELATION TO THE CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IF MEN ARE TO BE OBSERVED SCIENTIFICALLY THE STANDARD BY WHICH CUSTOMS AND INSTITUTIONS MUST BE GAUGED CANNOT BE ABSTRACT MORAL PRINCIPLES BUT SUCCESS INSTITUTIONS ARE GOOD WHEN THEY LEAD TO SUCCESS IN COMPETITION AND BAD WHEN THEY HINDER THE UNITED STATES NOW FORMS A GIGANTIC AND GROWING EMPIRE SHE OCCUPIES A POSITION OF EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH FAVOURED ALIKE BY GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION BY DEPOSITS OF MINERALS BY CLIMATE AND BY THE CHARACTER OF HER POPULATION SHE HAS LITTLE TO FEAR EITHER IN PEACE OR WAR FROM RIVALS PROVIDED THE FRICTION CREATED BY THE MOVEMENT OF THE MASSES WITH WHICH SHE HAS TO DEAL DOES NOT NEUTRALISE HER ENERGY THE ALTERNATIVE PRESENTED IS PLAIN WE MAY CHERISH IDEALS AND RISK SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS TO REALISE THEM SUCH IS THE EMOTIONAL INSTINCT OR WE MAY REGARD OUR GOVERNMENT DISPASSIONATELY AS WE WOULD ANY OTHER MATTER OF BUSINESS THE UNITED STATES HAS BECOME THE HEART OF THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM OF THE AGE AND SHE MUST MAINTAIN HER SUPREMACY BY WIT AND FORCE OR SHARE THE FATE OF THE DISCARDED WHAT THAT FATE IS THE FOLLOWING PAGES TELL WITH CONSERVATIVE POPULATIONS SLAUGHTER IS NATURES REMEDY NEVER IN MY LIFE SHALL I FORGET THE HOURS IN WHICH I WRESTLED WITH THESE PROBLEMSTHE WEEKS AND THE MONTHS OF PERPLEXITY AND DESPAIR IT HAPPENED LONG BEFORE I EVER HEARD OF MR ADAMSFOR OF COURSE THESE THOUGHTS OF HIS ARE THE THOUGHTS OF THE TIME THERE IS A WHOLE LITERATURE OF THEM FROM KIPLING ROOSEVELT AND THE KAISER DOWN AND TO LOOK BACK OVER THE WEARY WASTES OF HISTORYTHE BLIND HIDEOUS NIGHTMARE OF BLOOD AND TEARSAND THEN TO LOOK FORWARD AND IN ALL THE FUTURE SEE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE NEVER ANY REST FOR AGONISED HUMANITY ONLY KILL OR BE KILLED FOR AGES UPON AGES TO SEE THIS NEWEST AND NOBLEST EFFORT OF MAN AFTER FREEDOM AND PEACETHE AMERICAN REPUBLICTURNED INTO AN ENGINE OF SLAUGHTER AND OPPRESSION TO BE SHOWN BY COLD SCIENTIFIC FORMULAS THAT MY REVERENCE FOR THE TRADITIONS OF LINCOLN WAS MERELY AN EMOTIONAL IMPULSE AND THAT THE END OF IT COULD ONLY BE THAT MY COUNTRY WOULD SHARE THE FATE OF THE DISCARDED I COULD NOT BELIEVE ITI CRIED OUT IN THE NIGHTTIME FOR DELIVERANCE FROM IT THERE IS A CERTAIN RELENTLESSNESS ABOUT MR ADAMS WHICH FILLS THE READER WITH REBELLION AND MAKES HIM THINK THE AVERAGE IMPERIALIST CAREFULLY AVOIDS DOING THIS HE VEILS HIS DOCTRINES WITH MORAL PHRASES WITH THE DECENT PRETENCE OF DESTINY AT THE VERY LEAST BUT MR ADAMS DANCES A VERY WARDANCE UPON THE THING CALLED MORAL SENSENEVER BEFORE WAS IT MADE TO SEEM SUCH AN IMPERTINENT SUPERFLUITY FOOTNOTE PORTIONS OF THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENT WERE PUBLISHED AS AN ARTICLE IN THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW HAVE YOU THE READER NEVER HAD ONE SMALLEST DOUBT DOES IT NOT FOR INSTANCE SEEM STRANGE TO YOU NOW WHEN YOU THINK OF IT THAT THIS MIGHTY PEOPLE CANNOT STAY QUIETLY AT HOME AND LIVE THEIR OWN LIFE AND MIND THEIR OWN AFFAIRS HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT OUR EXISTENCE AS A NATION DEPENDS UPON EXPANSION IS IT THAT OUR POPULATION IS GROWING SO FAST BUT HERE IS OUR IMPERIALIST PRESIDENT LAMENTING THAT OUR POPULATION IS NOT GROWING FAST ENOUGH AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGHT TO FIND ROOM FOR OUR CHILDREN AND WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN IN ORDER THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO FIGHT WE DEPLORE RACE SUICIDE AND WE GIVE AS OUR REASON THAT IT PREVENTS RACEMURDER PICTURE TO YOURSELF HALF A DOZEN MEN ON AN ISLAND IF THE ISLAND BE FERTILE THEY CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT ANY FOREIGN TRADE CAN THEY NOT AND THEN WHY CANNOT A NATION DO IT ACCORDING TO MULHALL IN TWO MILLIONS OF OUR AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS WERE RAISING FOOD FOR FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND ALL OUR IMPORTS ARE LUXURIES SAVE A FEW THINGS SUCH AS TEA AND COFFEE AND SOME MEDICINES AND STILL OUR EXISTENCE AS A NATION DEPENDS UPON FOREIGN TRADETRADE WITH FILIPINOS AND CHINAMEN WITH HOTTENTOTS AND ESQUIMAUX WHY CAN YOU THE READER TELL ME WE MANUFACTURE MORE THAN WE CAN USE YOU SAY UNLESS WE CAN SELL THE BALANCE TO THE CHINAMEN SOME OF OUR FACTORIES MUST CLOSE DOWN AND THEN SOME OF OUR PEOPLE WOULD STARVE BUT WHY I ASK CANNOT OUR OWN STARVING PEOPLE HAVE THE THINGS THAT GO ABROADSOME OF ALL THAT FOOD THAT GOES ABROAD FOR INSTANCE WHY IS IT THAT THE CHINAMEN COME FIRST AND OUR OWN PEOPLE AFTERWARDS UNTIL WE HAVE MADE SOME THINGS FOR THE CHINAMEN YOU EXPLAIN WE HAVE NO MONEY TO BUY ANYTHING OURSELVES AND SO ALWAYS THE CHINAMEN FIRST IT SEEMS SUCH A STRANGE UPSIDEDOWN ARRANGEMENTDOES IT NOT SEEM SO TO YOU FOR LOOK YOU THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND ARE IN THE SAME FIX AND THE PEOPLE OF GERMANY ARE IN THE SAME FIXTHE PEOPLE OF ALL THE COMPETING NATIONS ARE IN THE SAME FIX THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO TO WAR TO KILL EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO GET A CHANCE TO SELL SOMETHING TO THE CHINAMEN SO THAT THEY CAN GET MONEY TO BUY SOME THINGS FOR THEMSELVES THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING THAT IN MANCHURIA FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS MORE AMAZING YET THEY HAD TO GO AND MURDER SOME OF THE CHINAMEN IN ORDER TO COMPEL THE REST TO BUY SOMETHING SO THAT THEY COULD GET MONEY TO BUY SOMETHING FOR THEMSELVES HOW LONG CAN IT BE POSSIBLE FOR A HUMAN BEING WITH A SPARK OF EITHER CONSCIENCE OR BRAINS IN HIM TO GAZE AT SUCH A STATE OF AFFAIRS AND NOT KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT IT AND HOW LONG COULD HE GAZE BEFORE THE TRUTH OF IT WOULD FLASH OVER HIMTHAT THE REASON FOR IT IS THAT SOME PRIVATE PARTY OWNS ALL THE MACHINERY AND MATERIALS OF PRODUCTION AND WILL NOT GIVE THE PEOPLE ANYTHING UNTIL THEY HAVE FIRST MADE SOMETHING THAT CAN BE SOLD THAT ALL THE WORLD LIES AT THE MERCY OF THOSE WHO OWN THE MATERIALS AND MACHINERY AND WHO LEAVE MEN TO STARVE WHEN THEY CANNOT MAKE PROFITS AND THAT THIS IS WHY WE AMERICANS CANNOT STAY AT HOME AND BE HAPPY BUT ARE FORCED TO GO TRADING WITH FILIPINOS AND CHINAMEN HOTTENTOTS AND ESQUIMAUX AND COMPETING FOR EMPIRE WITH OUR BROTHERS IN ENGLAND AND GERMANY AND JAPAN IF THE READER BE AN AVERAGE AMERICAN THESE THOUGHTS WILL BE NEW TO HIM HE HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP ON A DIET OF MISUNDERSTOOD MALTHUSIANISM HE IS TOLD THAT LIFE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE AND ALWAYS WILL BE THAT THERE IS NOT FOOD ENOUGH TO GO ROUND AND THAT THEREFORE EVERY NOW AND THEN THE SURPLUS POPULATION HAS TO BE CUT DOWN BY FAMINE AND WAR IT IS TO BE POINTED OUT CONCERNING THE DOCTRINE THAT WHILE HE SWEARS ALLEGIANCE TO IT HE DOESNT LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRACTICAL TEST HE SHOWS THAT HE DOES NOT REALLY BELIEVE IT WHENEVER FAMINE COMES HE SUBSCRIBES TO A GRAINFUND AND DOES HIS BEST TO DEFEAT NATURE WHEN WAR COMES HE GETS UP A RED CROSS SOCIETY FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AND YET HE STILL CONTINUES TO SWEAR BY THIS WIPING OUT OF THE NATIONS AND ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT ABOLISHING POVERTY HE WAVES ASIDE AS UTOPIAN THE WRITER MAY FAIL IN HIS PURPOSE WITH THIS PAPER BUT HE WILL NOT HAVE WRITTEN IN VAIN IF HE CAN LEAD A FEW MEN TO SEE THE PITIFUL FOLLY OF THAT HALFBAKED THEORY WHICH RANKS MEN WITH THE WILD BEASTS OF THE JUNGLE AND IGNORES THE EXISTENCE OF BOTH SCIENCE AND MORALITY HE CAN DO THAT ASSUREDLY WITH ANY ONE WHOM HE CAN INDUCE TO READ ONE LITTLE BOOKPRINCE KROPOTKINS FIELDS FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED NINE YEARS AGO BUT APPARENTLY IT HAS NOT YET HAD TIME TO AFFECT THE COGITATIONS OF THE ORTHODOX ECONOMISTS YOU STILL READ AS YOU HAVE BEEN USED TO READING SINCE THE DAYS OF ADAM SMITH THAT THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE SOIL ARE STRICTLY LIMITED AND THAT POPULATION ALWAYS STAYS JUST WITHIN THE STARVATION LIMIT NEARLY ALL THE FERTILE LAND IN THIS COUNTRY FOR INSTANCE IS NOW IN USE AND SO WE SHALL SOON REACH THE LIMIT HERE THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN HAVE LONG SINCE PASSED IT AND THEY WOULD STARVE TO DEATH WERE IT NOT FOR OUR SURPLUS AND THERE ARE PORTIONS OF THE WORLD WHERE POPULATION IS EVEN MORE DENSE AS IN BELGIUM ALL THIS YOU HAVE KNOWN FROM YOUR SCHOOLDAYS AND YOU THINK YOU KNOW IT PERFECTLY AND BEYOND DISPUTE AND SO HOW ASTONISHED YOU WILL BE TO BE TOLD THAT IT IS SIMPLY ONE OF THE MOST STUPID AND STUPEFYING DELUSIONS THAT EVER WERE BELIEVED AND PROPAGATED AMONG MEN THAT THE LIMITS OF THE PRODUCTIVE POSSIBILITIES OF THE SOIL HAVE NOT ONLY NOT BEEN ATTAINED BUT ARE SO FAR AS SCIENCE CAN NOW SEE ABSOLUTELY UNATTAINABLE THAT NOT ONLY COULD ENGLAND SUPPORT WITH EASE HER OWN POPULATION ON HER OWN SOIL AND NOT ONLY COULD BELGIUM DO IT BUT ANY MOST CROWDED PORTION OF THE WORLD COULD DO IT AND DO IT ONCE AGAIN AND YET ONCE AGAIN AND DO IT WITH TWO OR THREE HOURS OF WORK A DAY BY A SMALL PORTION OF ITS POPULATION THAT ENGLAND COULD NOW SUPPORT NOT MERELY HER THIRTYTHREE MILLION INHABITANTS BUT SEVENTYFIVE AND PERHAPS A HUNDRED MILLION AND THAT THE UNITED STATES COULD NOW SUPPORT A BILLION AND A QUARTER OF PEOPLE OR JUST ABOUT THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THIS PLANET AND THAT THIS COULD BE DONE YEAR AFTER YEAR AND ENTIRELY WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF THE EXHAUSTION OF THE SOIL AND ALL THIS NOT ANY THEORY OF A CLOSET SPECULATOR OR A UTOPIAN DREAMER BUT BY METHODS THAT ARE USED YEAR AFTER YEAR BY THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN WHO ARE MAKING MONEY BY IT IN ALL PORTIONS OF THE WORLDIN THE MARKETGARDENS OF PARIS AND LONDON OF BELGIUM HOLLAND AND THE ISLAND OF JERSEY THE TRUCKFARMS OF FLORIDA AND MINNESOTA AND OF NORFOLK VIRGINIA PRINCE KROPOTKIN WRITES WHILE SCIENCE DEVOTES ITS CHIEF ATTENTION TO INDUSTRIAL PURSUITS A LIMITED NUMBER OF LOVERS OF NATURE AND A LEGION OF WORKERS WHOSE VERY NAMES WILL REMAIN UNKNOWN TO POSTERITY HAVE CREATED OF LATE A QUITE NEW AGRICULTURE AS SUPERIOR TO MODERN FARMING AS MODERN FARMING IS SUPERIOR TO THE OLD THREEFIELDS SYSTEM OF OUR ANCESTORS THEY SMILE WHEN WE BOAST ABOUT THE ROTATION SYSTEM HAVING PERMITTED US TO TAKE FROM THE FIELD ONE CROP EVERY YEAR OR FOUR CROPS EVERY THREE YEARS BECAUSE THEIR AMBITION IS TO HAVE SIX AND NINE CROPS FROM THE VERY SAME PLOT OF LAND EVERY TWELVE MONTHS THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND OUR TALK ABOUT GOOD AND BAD SOILS BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE SOIL THEMSELVES AND MAKE IT IN SUCH QUANTITIES AS TO BE COMPELLED YEARLY TO SELL SOME OF IT OTHERWISE IT WOULD RAISE UP THE LEVELS OF THEIR GARDENS BY HALF AN INCH EVERY YEAR THEY AIM AT CROPPING NOT FIVE OR SIX TONS OF GRASS TO THE ACRE AS WE DO BUT FROM FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED TONS OF VARIOUS VEGETABLES ON THE SAME SPACE NOT TWENTYFIVE DOLLARS WORTH OF HAY BUT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH OF VEGETABLES OF THE PLAINEST DESCRIPTION CABBAGES AND CARROTS THAT IS WHERE AGRICULTURE IS GOING NOW THE WRITER TELLS ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS IN DETAIL HERE IS THE CULTURE MARACHERE OF PARISA M PONCE WITH A TINY ORCHARD OF TWO AND SEVENTENTHS ACRES FOR WHICH HE PAYS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS RENT A YEAR AND FROM WHICH HE TAKES PRODUCE THAT COULD NOT BE NAMED SHORT OF SEVERAL PAGES OF FIGURES TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF CARROTS TWENTY THOUSAND OF ONIONS AND RADISHES SIX THOUSAND HEADS OF CABBAGE THREE THOUSAND OF CAULIFLOWER FIVE THOUSAND BASKETS OF TOMATOES FIVE THOUSAND DOZEN CHOICE FRUIT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTYFOUR THOUSAND HEADS OF SALADIN ALL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF VEGETABLES SAYS THE AUTHOR THE PARIS GARDENER NOT ONLY DEFIES THE SOILHE WOULD GROW THE SAME CROPS ON AN ASPHALT PAVEMENTHE DEFIES CLIMATE HIS WALLS WHICH ARE BUILT TO REFLECT LIGHT AND TO PROTECT THE WALLTREES FROM THE NORTHERN WINDS HIS WALLTREE SHADES AND GLASS PROTECTORS HIS PPINIRES HAVE MADE A RICH SOUTHERN GARDEN OUT OF THE SUBURBS OF PARIS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IS THAT THE POPULATION OF THE DISTRICTS OF THAT CITY THREE MILLIONS AND A HALF OF PEOPLE COULD IF IT WERE NECESSARY BE MAINTAINED IN THEIR OWN TERRITORY PROVIDED WITH FOOD BOTH ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE FROM A PIECE OF GROUND LESS THAN SIXTY MILES ON A SIDE AND AT THE SAME TIME BY THE SAME METHODS THEY ARE RAISING THIRTY TONS OF POTATOES ON AN ACRE IN MINNESOTA AND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BUSHELS OF CORN IN IOWA AND SIX HUNDRED BUSHELS OF ONIONS IN FLORIDA AND WITH MACHINERY ON THE PRAIRIE WHEATFARMS THEY RAISE CROPS AT A COST WHICH MAKES TWELVE HOURS AND A HALF OF WORK OF ALL KINDS ENOUGH TO SUPPLY A MAN WITH THE FLOUR PART OF HIS FOOD FOR A YEAR AND THEN AS IF TO CAP THE CLIMAX COMES MR HORACE FLETCHER WITH HIS DISCOVERY THAT ALL THE AILMENTS OF CIVILISED MAN INCLUDING OLD AGE AND DEATH ARE DUE TO OVEREATING AND PROFESSOR CHITTENDEN WITH HIS PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION THAT THE QUANTITY OF FOOD NEEDED BY MAN IS ABOUT FOURTENTHS OF WHAT ALL PHYSIOLOGISTS HAVE PREVIOUSLY TAUGHT AND WHILE ALL THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A DECADE WHILE ENCYCLOPEDIAS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT IT OUR POLITICAL ECONOMISTS CONTINUE TO DISCUSS WAGES AND LABOUR RENT AND INTEREST EXCHANGE AND CONSUMPTION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE DREARY CENTURYOLD FORMULA THAT THERE MUST ALWAYS BE AN INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF FOOD IN THE WORLD FOOTNOTE HORACE FLETCHER THE ABZ OF OUR OWN NUTRITION R L CHITTENDEN PHYSIOLOGICAL

IS IT WITH EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF LABOUR CARROLL D WRIGHT HAS FIGURED THE RELATIVE COSTS OF DOING VARIOUS PIECES OF WORK BY HAND AND BY MODERN MACHINERY

HAND OPERATORS SINCE ALL THESE WONDERS ARE THE COMMONPLACE FACTS OF MODERN INDUSTRY IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT HERE AND THERE MEN SHOULD BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT THEM HERE IS THE NAVE QUESTION RECENTLY ASKED BY THE EDITOR OF A MONTREAL NEWSPAPER WHICH I HAPPENED ON WITH THE BEST OF MACHINERY AT THE PRESENT DAY ONE MAN CAN PRODUCE WOOLLENS FOR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ONE MAN CAN PRODUCE BOOTS AND SHOES FOR ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE ONE MAN CAN PRODUCE BREAD FOR TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE YET THOUSANDS CANNOT GET WOOLLENS BOOTS AND SHOES OR BREAD THERE MUST BE SOME REASON FOR THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS THERE IS A REASON A PERFECTLY PLAIN AND SIMPLE REASON WHICH ALL OVER THE WORLD THE WORKINGPEOPLE WHOM IT CONCERNS ARE COMING TO UNDERSTAND THE REASON IS THAT ALL THE WOOLLEN MANUFACTORIES THE BOOT AND SHOE AND BREAD MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THE SOURCES OF THE RAW MATERIALS OF THESE AND ALL THE MEANS OF HANDLING AND DISTRIBUTING THEM WHEN THEY ARE MANUFACTURED BELONG TO A FEW PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS INSTEAD OF TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND SO INSTEAD OF THE COTTONSPINNER THE SHOEOPERATIVE AND THE BREADMAKER HAVING FREE ACCESS TO THEM TO WORK EACH AS LONG AS HE PLEASES PRODUCE AS MUCH AS HE CARES TO AND EXCHANGE HIS PRODUCTS FOR AS MUCH OF THE PRODUCTS OF OTHER WORKERS AS HE NEEDS EACH ONE OF THESE WORKERS CAN ONLY GET AT THE MACHINES BY THE CONSENT OF ANOTHER MAN AND THEN DOES NOT GET WHAT HE PRODUCES BUT ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF IT AND DOES NOT GET THAT EXCEPT WHEN THE OWNER OF THE BALANCE CAN FIND SOME ONE WITH MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY THAT BALANCE AT A PROFIT TO HIM PROF HERTZKA THE AUSTRIAN ECONOMIST IN HIS LAWS OF SOCIAL EVOLUTION HAS ELABORATELY INVESTIGATED THE ONE REAL QUESTION OF POLITICAL ECONOMY TODAY THE ACTUAL LABOUR AND TIME NECESSARY FOR THE CREATION UNDER MODERN CONDITIONS OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE FOR A PEOPLE HERE ARE THE RESULTS FOR THE AUSTRIAN PEOPLE OF TWENTYTWO MILLION IT TAKES ACRES OF AGRICULTURAL LAND AND OF PASTURAGE FOR ALL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS THEN I ALLOWED A HOUSE TO BE BUILT FOR EVERY FAMILY CONSISTING OF FIVE ROOMS I FOUND THAT ALL INDUSTRIES AGRICULTURE ARCHITECTURE BUILDING FLOUR SUGAR COAL IRON MACHINEBUILDING CLOTHING AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTION NEED LABOURERS EMPLOYED HOURS PER DAY DAYS A YEAR TO SATISFY EVERY IMAGINABLE WANT FOR INHABITANTS THESE LABOURERS ARE ONLY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION ABLE TO DO WORK EXCLUDING WOMEN AND ALL PERSONS UNDER OR OVER YEARS OF AGE ALL THESE LATTER TO BE CONSIDERED AS NOT ABLE SHOULD THE ABLE MEN BE ENGAGED IN WORK INSTEAD OF THEY NEED ONLY TO WORK DAYS EVERY YEAR TO PRODUCE EVERYTHING NEEDED FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE POPULATION OF AUSTRIA BUT SHOULD THE WORK ALL THE YEAR SAY DAYSWHICH THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO DO TO KEEP THE SUPPLY FRESH IN EVERY DEPARTMENTEACH ONE WOULD ONLY WORK HOUR AND MINUTES PER DAY BUT TO ENGAGE TO PRODUCE ALL THE LUXURIES IN ADDITION WOULD TAKE IN ROUND FIGURES WORKERS CLASSED AND ASSORTED AS ABOVE OR ONLY PER CENT OF ALL THOSE ABLE EXCLUDING EVERY WOMAN OR EVERY PERSON UNDER OR OVER AS BEFORE THE ABLE STRONG MALE MEMBERS COULD PRODUCE EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE FOR THE WHOLE NATION OF IN HOURS AND MINUTES PER DAY WORKING DAYS A YEAR BUT THEN YOU SAY IF THIS BE TRUE IF TWO HOURS WORK WILL PRODUCE EVERYTHING HOW CAN EVERYBODY GO ON WORKING TWELVE HOURS FOREVER THEY CANT AND THAT IS JUST WHY I AM WRITING THIS BOOK THEY CAN DO IT ONLY UNTIL THEY HAVE FILLED THE NEEDS FIRST OF THEMSELVES THEN OF ALL THE FILIPINOS AND CHINAMEN HOTTENTOTS AND ESQUIMAUX WHO HAVE MONEY TO BUY ANYTHINGAND THEN UNTIL THEY HAVE FILLED ALL THE FACTORIES WAREHOUSES AND STORES OF THE COUNTRY TO OVERFLOWING THEN THEY CANNOT DO ONE SINGLE THING MORE THEN THEY ARE OUT OF WORK THEY CAN GO ON SO LONG AS THEIR MASTERS CAN FIND A MARKET IN WHICH TO SELL THEIR PRODUCT AT A PROFIT THEN THEY HAVE TO STOP AND THEN SUDDENLY INSTANTLY GOD HELP THEM THEY HAVE TO TAKE THEIR CHOICE BETWEEN TWO ALTERNATIVESBETWEEN AN INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC AND A POLITICAL EMPIRE EITHER THEY WILL HEAR PRINCE KROPOTKIN OR THEY WILL HEAR MR BROOKS ADAMS EITHER THEY WILL TAKE THE INSTRUMENTS AND MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND PRODUCE FOR USE AND NOT FOR PROFIT OR ELSE THEY WILL FORGE THEMSELVES INTO AN ENGINE OF WAR TO BE WIELDED BY A MILITARY DESPOT IN THAT CASE THEY WILL FLING THEMSELVES UPON CHINA AND JAPAN AND SEIZE NORTHERN CHINA THE GREATEST PRIZE OF MODERN TIMES THEY WILL ENTER UPON A CAREER OF EMPIRE AND BY THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER OF WAR THEY WILL KEEP DOWN POPULATION WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BY THE WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION OF WAR THEY KEEP DOWN THE SURPLUS OF PRODUCTS SO THERE WILL BE MORE WORK FOR THE WORKERS FOR A TIME AND MORE PROFITS FOR THE MASTERS FOR A TIME UNTIL WHAT WEALTH THERE IS IN NORTHERN CHINA HAS ALSO BEEN CONCENTRATED AND POSSESSED WHEN ONCE MORE THERE WILL BEGIN DISTRESS BY THAT TIME HOWEVER WE SHALL HAVE AN HEREDITARY ARISTOCRACY STRONGLY INTRENCHED AND A PROLETARIAT DEGRADED BEYOND RECALL SO THAT OUR RIOTS WILL END IN MERE SLAUGHTER AND WASTE AND WE SHALL NEVER AGAIN SEE FREEDOM WE SHALL RUN THEN THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE ROMAN EMPIREOF FRENZIED PROFLIGACY AMONG THE WEALTHY AND BEASTLY FEROCITY AMONG THE POPULACE UNTIL AT LAST WE FALL INTO IMBECILITY AND ARE OVERWHELMED BY SOME NEW CLEAN RACE WHICH THE STRONG HEART OF NATURE HAS POURED OUT EMPIRES HAVE RISEN AND HAVE FALLEN BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN AS MR ADAMS ASSERTS BECAUSE OF VARIATIONS OF TRADE ROUTES BUT SOLELY BECAUSE OF WEALTHCONCENTRATION WITH ITS ENSUING CORRUPTION IGNORANCE AND BRUTALITY AMONG THE POPULACE AND AVARICE AND LUXURY AMONG THE RICH LET THE READER TAKE FROUDES CSAR AND READ IN THE FIRST CHAPTER HIS PICTURE OF THE LAST DAYS OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC AN AGE IN SO MANY WAYS THE COUNTERPART OF OUR OWN THE BLOSSOMING PERIOD OF THE OLD CIVILISATION WHEN THE INTELLECT WAS TRAINED TO THE HIGHEST POINT THAT IT COULD REACH AND ON THE GREAT SUBJECTS OF HUMAN INTEREST ON MORALS AND POLITICS ON POETRY AND ART EVEN ON RELIGION ITSELF AND THE SPECULATIVE PROBLEMS OF LIFE MEN THOUGHT AS WE THINK DOUBTED WHERE WE DOUBT ARGUED AS WE ARGUE ASPIRED AND STRUGGLED AFTER THE SAME OBJECTS IT WAS AN AGE OF MATERIAL PROGRESS AND MATERIAL CIVILISATION AN AGE OF CIVIL LIBERTY AND INTELLECTUAL CULTURE AN AGE OF PAMPHLETS AND EPIGRAMS OF SALONS AND OF DINNERPARTIES OR SENATORIAL MAJORITIES AND ELECTORAL CORRUPTION THE HIGHEST OFFICES OF STATE WERE OPEN IN THEORY TO THE MEANEST CITIZEN THEY WERE CONFINED IN FACT TO THOSE WHO HAD THE LONGEST PURSES OR THE MOST READY USE OF THE TONGUE ON POPULAR PLATFORMS DISTINCTIONS OF BIRTH HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR DISTINCTIONS OF WEALTH THE STRUGGLES BETWEEN PLEBEIANS AND PATRICIANS FOR EQUALITY OF PRIVILEGE WERE OVER AND A NEW DIVISION HAD BEEN FORMED BETWEEN THE PARTY OF PROPERTY AND A PARTY THAT DESIRED A CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY THE FREE CULTIVATORS WERE DISAPPEARING FROM THE SOIL ITALY WAS BEING ABSORBED INTO VAST ESTATES HELD BY A FEW FAVOURED FAMILIES AND CULTIVATED BY SLAVES WHILE THE OLD AGRICULTURAL POPULATION WAS DRIVEN OFF THE LAND AND WAS CROWDED INTO TOWNS THE RICH WERE EXTRAVAGANT FOR LIFE HAD CEASED TO HAVE PRACTICAL INTEREST EXCEPT FOR ITS MATERIAL PLEASURES THE OCCUPATION OF THE HIGHER CLASSES WAS TO OBTAIN MONEY WITHOUT LABOUR AND TO SPEND IT IN IDLE ENJOYMENT PATRIOTISM SURVIVED ON THE LIPS BUT PATRIOTISM MEANT THE ASCENDANCY OF THE PARTY WHICH WOULD MAINTAIN THE EXISTING ORDER OF THINGS OR WOULD OVERTHROW IT FOR A MORE EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE GOOD THINGS WHICH ALONE WERE VALUED RELIGION ONCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE LAWS AND RULE OF PERSONAL CONDUCT HAD SUBSIDED INTO OPINION THE EDUCATED IN THEIR HEARTS DISBELIEVED IT TEMPLES WERE STILL BUILT WITH INCREASING SPLENDOUR THE ESTABLISHED FORMS WERE SCRUPULOUSLY OBSERVED PUBLIC MEN SPOKE CONVENTIONALLY OF PROVIDENCE THAT THEY MIGHT THROW ON THEIR OPPONENTS THE ODIUM OF IMPIETY BUT OF GENUINE BELIEF THAT LIFE HAD ANY SERIOUS MEANING THERE WAS NONE REMAINING BEYOND THE CIRCLE OF THE SILENT PATIENT IGNORANT MULTITUDE IS NOT THIS A PARALLEL TO MAKE ONE PAUSE AND THINK AND IF OUR AMERICAN REPUBLIC IS TO ESCAPE THE FATE OF ROME TO WHAT CAUSE WILL IT BE DUE THE ROMAN FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN BY WHOM THE HARD WORK OF THE WORLD WAS DONE WERE CHIEFLY SLAVES THOSE WHO HELD THE FRANCHISE THE FREE ROMAN CITIZENS WERE A COMPARATIVELY SMALL CLASS AND THE PATRICIANS BOUGHT THEM WITH BREAD AND CIRCUSES AND SO HELD THE REINS OF POWER IN OUR PRESENT TIME HOWEVER THOSE WHO DO THE WORK AND THOSE WHO HAVE THE BALLOT ARE THE SAME CLASS AND ALSO THEY HAVE THE PUBLIC SCHOOL AND THE PRESS AND THE WHOLE OF MODERN SCIENCE AT THEIR BACKS MORE IMPORTANT YETTHE ALLDOMINATING FACTIS THE MACHINE THE ROMAN CHATTELSLAVE WORKED WITH HIS HANDS WHILE THE MODERN WAGESLAVE WORKS WITH TOOLS OF GIGANTIC SPEED AND POWER WHICH MEANS THAT OUR MODERN ECONOMIC PROCESS WHILE INFINITELY MORE CRUEL AND DESTRUCTIVE MAKES UP FOR THESE QUALITIES BY THE CERTAINTY AND SWIFTNESS WITH WHICH IT RUSHES TO ITS END SO IT IS THAT A REVOLUTION WHICH IN ROME TOOK CENTURIES TO CULMINATE AND FAIL WILL REQUIRE ONLY DECADES IN AMERICA TO ACCOMPLISH ITS INEVITABLE TRIUMPH CHAPTER IV SOCIAL DECAY IF MY ANALYSIS OF THE INDUSTRIAL PROCESS BE CORRECT THERE WILL BE TWO DEVELOPMENTS OBSERVABLE IN OUR SOCIETY THE FIRST A MATERIAL CHANGE A KIND OF ECONOMIC APOPLEXY THE CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH IN ONE PORTION OF SOCIETY ACCOMPANIED BY AN INTENSIFICATION OF COMPETITION A FALLING IN THE RATE OF INTEREST AND A STEADY RISE IN THE COST OF LIVING AND SECOND A SPIRITUAL CHANGE COINCIDENT WITH THE MATERIAL ONE A PROTEST AGAINST THE RISING FRENZY OF GREED AND AGAINST THE CONSTANTLY INCREASING ECONOMIC PRESSURE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THESE TWO PROCESSES SHOULD BE CLEARLY PERCEIVED AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP CORRECTLY UNDERSTOOD FOR THERE IS NO ASPECT OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM ABOUT WHICH THERE IS MORE BAD THINKING DONE THE TWO ARE CAUSE AND EFFECT AND THEY EXPLAIN AND PROVE EACH OTHER AND YET ALMOST INVARIABLY YOU WILL HEAR THEM CITED AS CONTRADICTING EACH OTHER IF FOR INSTANCE ONE SPEAKS OF THE EVERRISING TIDE OF MISERY AND SUFFERING IN OUR SOCIETY HE WILL BE MET WITH THE RESPONSE THAT THE WORLD IS GETTING BETTER ALL THE TIME AND WHEN HE ASKS FOR SOME PROOF OF THE STATEMENT THE REPLY WILL BE THAT A GREAT NATIONAL AWAKENING IS GOING ON THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING NEW IDEALS AND A NEW PUBLIC SPIRIT SIMILARLY I HAVE TIME AND AGAIN WHEN ADVOCATING THIS OR THAT CONCRETE REMEDY BEEN MET WITH THE STATEMENT THAT THE CURE FOR THE EVILS OF THE TIME IS PUBLICITYTHAT THE PEOPLE MUST BE EDUCATEDTHAT WE MUST APPEAL TO MENS MORAL SENSE ETC IT IS USELESS TO ARGUE WITH A PERSON WHO CANNOT PERCEIVE THAT ALL THESE THINGS ARE SIMPLY MEANS TO AN END AND NOT THE END YOU CANNOT EDUCATE PEOPLE JUST TO BE EDUCATED WHEN YOU APPEAL TO THEM YOU HAVE TO APPEAL TO THEM TO DO SOMETHING ONE CANNOT INSIST TOO STRONGLY UPON THE FUTILITY OF SENTIMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PROCESS WE ARE DEALING WITH FACTS WITH GRIM AND BRUTAL AND MERCILESS REALITY AND IT WILL NOT AVAIL YOU TO TRY TO SMOOTH IT OVERIT WILL NOT DO ANY GOOD TO TURN YOUR HEAD AND REFUSE TO FACE IT HERE IS THE MONSTER MACHINE OF COMPETITION GRINDING REMORSELESSLY ON THE WEALTH OF THE WORLD IS RUSHING WITH CYCLONIC SPEED INTO ONE PORTION OF THE SOCIAL BODY AND IN THE OTHER PORTION WHOLE CLASSES OF MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARE BEING SWEPT OUT OF EXISTENCE ARE BEING WIPED OFF THE ECONOMIC SLATE EXACTLY AS CAPITAL PILES UPAT COMPOUNDED AND RECOMPOUNDED INTERESTSO ALSO PILES UP THE MASS OF HUMAN MISERY OF EVERY CONCEIVABLE SORTLUXURY DEBAUCHERY AND CYNICISM AT THE TOP PROSTITUTION SUICIDE INSANITY AND CRIME AT THE BOTTOM POLITICAL CORRUPTION SPREADS FURTHER AND EATS DEEPER BUSINESS PRACTICE BECOMES MORE IMPERSONAL AND MORE RUTHLESS AND ALL PROGRESS AWAITS THE SWING OF THE PENDULUM THE TIME WHEN THE CUMULATIVE PRESSURE OF ALL THIS MASS OF MISERY SHALL HAVE DRIVEN THE PEOPLE TO FRENZY AND FORCED THEM TO OVERTURN THE SYSTEM OF CLASS EXPLOITATION AND GREED I PURPOSE TO CITE IN DETAIL THE SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE AND DECAY IN OUR BODY POLITIC BEFORE I BEGIN I WISH TO PUT MY INTERPRETATION OF THEM INTO ONE SENTENCE WHICH A MAN CAN CARRY AWAY WITH HIM I SAY THAT THE EVILS OF OUR TIME ARE DUE WITHOUT EXCEPTION TO ONE SINGLE CAUSETHAT OUR PEOPLE ARE BEING DRIVEN WITH CONSTANTLY INCREASING RIGOUR TO THE ULTIMATELY HOPELESS TASK OF PAYING INTEREST UPON A MASS OF CAPITAL WHICH IS INCREASING AT COMPOUND INTEREST CONSIDER IN THE FIRST PLACE THE BROADER ASPECT OF THE SITUATIONTHE DOLLARMADNESS OF THE TIME WHICH IS THE STAPLE THEME OF THE MORALIST I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS IN CONTROL OF A GREAT BUSINESS CONCERN AND WHO WILL READ THIS LITTLE BOOK WITH INTENSE DISAPPROVAL AND YET SO FEARFULLY HAS THIS MAN BEEN DRIVEN BY THE LASH OF COMPETITION THAT WHEN I SAW HIM LAST HE COULD SCARCELY DIGEST A BIT OF DRY BREAD AND HIS HAND TREMBLED SO THAT HE COULD HARDLY LIFT A GLASS OF WATER TO HIS LIPS HE TALKED OF HIS BUSINESS IN HIS SLEEP AND HE COULD NOT GO FOR A WALK AND FORGET IT FOR FIVE MINUTES AND WHY WAS IT MONEY HE HAS SO MUCH THAT HIS FAMILY COULD NOT SPEND IT IF THEY LIVED A HUNDRED YEARS BUT IT WAS HIS BUSINESS IT WAS HIS LIFE HE WAS CAUGHT IN THE MILL AND HE COULD NOT GET OUT HIS IS ONE OF THOSE FEW INDUSTRIES WHICH HAVE NOT YET FORMED A TRUST AND HE IS IN THE LAST GASP OF THE COMPETITIVE STRUGGLEHE HAS TO PLOT AND PLAN DAY AND NIGHT TO GET NEW ORDERS AND TO CUT DOWN EXPENSES AND TO KEEP UP THE DIVIDENDS UPON WHICH HIS REPUTATION RESTS AND AS IT IS WITH HIM SO IT IS WITH THE REST OF US WE HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME WE HAVE TO CUT OUR NEIGHBOURS THROAT KNOWING THAT OTHERWISE OUR NEIGHBOUR WILL CUT OURS AND YEAR AFTER YEAR THE PRESSURE OF THE WHOLE THING GROWS MORE TENSE SUICIDE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS INCREASED FROM TWELVE PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF POPULATION IN THE YEAR TO SIXTEEN IN THE YEAR AND SEVENTEEN IN THE YEAR IN GERMANY IT ROSE FROM TWENTY TO NEARLY TWENTYTWO IN THE THREE YEARS BETWEEN AND IN ENGLAND IT ROSE FROM THIRTY IN TO THIRTYFIVE IN ACCORDING TO THE CIVILT CATTOLICA THE FREQUENCY OF THIS CRIME IN EUROPE HAS INCREASED FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT WHILE POPULATION HAS INCREASED ONLY SIXTY PER CENT AND THERE HAVE BEEN OVER ONE MILLION SUICIDES RECORDED IN THE LAST TWENTYFIVE YEARS THERE WERE NINETYTWO THOUSAND INSANE PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES IN ONE HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND IN AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTYFIVE THOUSAND IN PER ONE THOUSAND OF POPULATION THERE WERE TWENTYNINE PRISONERS IN SIXTYONE IN EIGHTYFIVE IN ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN IN AND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTYTWO IN IN THE POPULATION OF THIS COUNTRY CONSUMED EIGHT AND SIXTYONE ONEHUNDREDTHS GALLONS OF LIQUOR PER CAPITA IN THEY CONSUMED FIFTEEN AND FIFTYTHREE ONEHUNDREDTHS AND IN THEY CONSUMED NINETEEN AND FORTYEIGHT ONEHUNDREDTHS THE ACTUAL CONSUMPTION AT THE LAST DATE WAS A BILLION AND A HALF OF GALLONS THESE FIGURES TAKE BUT A FEW LINES TO STATE AND YET NO HUMAN IMAGINATION CAN FORM ANY CONCEPTION OF THE FRIGHTFUL MASS OF HUMAN ANGUISH WHICH THEY IMPLY THEY CONSTITUTE IN THEMSELVES A PROOF OF THE THESIS HERE ADVANCED THAT THERE IS AT WORK IN OUR SOCIETY SOME GREAT AND FUNDAMENTAL EVIL FORCE FOOTNOTE AN EXPERIENCED MAGISTRATE RECORDER JOHN W GOFF OF NEW YORK TOLD ME NOT LONG SINCE THAT IN HIS JUDGMENT THE COURSE OF CRIME IN THIS COUNTRY IS NOT ONLY TOWARDS MORE FREQUENCY AND GRAVITY BUT THAT IT IS CHANGING ITS OLD HOT IMPULSIVENESS OPENNESS AND DIRECTNESS FOR COLD CALCULATION SECRETIVENESS AND DELIBERATE INTENTION TO STRIKE WITHOUT BEING DISCOVERED THIS PROGRESS AND DIFFERENCE HE ATTRIBUTES MEDIATELY AND IMMEDIATELY TO EXTENDING AND DEEPENING POVERTY HENRY GEORGE THE MENACE OF PRIVILEGE WHENEVER THE ADMINISTRATORS OF OUR CONSTANTLY INCREASING MASS OF CAPITAL FIND THEY ARE NO LONGER MAKING PROFITS THEY EITHER REDUCE WAGES OR RAISE THE PRICE OF THEIR PRODUCT ONE OR THE OTHER THEY MUST DO BECAUSE WITHOUT PROFITS THE MACHINE CANNOT RUN WHEN GOOD TIMES COME THEY SOMETIMES RAISE THE WAGES AGAINBECAUSE OF THE UNIONS BUT THEY NEVER LOWER THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCTTHE POOR CONSUMER IS A NONUNION MAN TWO YEARS AGO MR ROCKEFELLER PUT UP THE PRICE OF OIL ONE CENT AND THE BEEF TRUST HAS DONE THE SAME ABOUT ONCE A YEAR AND OF COURSE A GENERAL INCREASE IN PRICES IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS A GENERAL CUT IN WAGESIN EITHER CASE THE CONSUMER HAS TO WORK A LITTLE HARDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND IF HE CANNOT WORK HARDER HE DIES THE COALMINERS REJOICED IN THE AWARD OF THE COMMISSION UNTROUBLED BY THE EXTRA FIFTY CENTS THE COAL COMPANIES PUT ON THE PRODUCT BUT WHEN THE MINER COMES TO ADD UP HIS ACCOUNT WITH THE BUTCHER AND THE OIL MAN HE FINDS HE IS JUST WHERE HE WAS BEFORE HE DOES NOT KNOW WHY YOU UNDERSTANDIT IS MERELY THAT HE FINDS HIMSELF COMPELLED TO DO WITHOUT SOMETHING HE USED TO CONSIDER A NECESSITY DUNS REVIEW FIGURING THE COST OF LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES UPON A BASIS OF PUTS IT AT IN AND IN AN INCREASE OF FORTYONE PER CENT BRADSTREET RECKONING IN ANOTHER WAY SHOWS AN INCREASE FROM IN TO IN OR THIRTYNINE PER CENT ACCORDING TO THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COMMISSARY GENERAL UNITED STATES ARMY THE COST OF FEEDING THE SOLDIERS OF THE ARMY HAS INCREASED FROM EIGHTEEN CENTS IN TO THIRTYFOUR AND SIXTENTHS CENTS IN STATISTICIANS HAVE FIGURED THAT THE AVERAGE EMPLOYEE EARNS NINETY DOLLARS A YEAR MORE THAN HE DID TWENTY YEARS AGO WHILE IT COSTS HIM TO LIVE ON THE SAME SCALE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS A YEAR MORE ACCORDING TO THE LAST UNITED STATES CENSUS THE AVERAGE COMPENSATION PER WAGE EARNER WAS ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS WHILE THE VALUE OF THE MANUFACTURED PRODUCT WAS TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER WAGE EARNER PERHAPS NO CLEARER STATEMENT OF THE INTENSIFICATION OF EXPLOITATION CAN BE FOUND THAN IN THE FACT THAT WHEREAS THE AVERAGE PROFIT ON THE PRODUCTS OF ALL INDUSTRIES WAS THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE DOLLARS PER WAGE EARNER IN IN IT HAD INCREASED TO SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTYSIX DOLLARS ANOTHER CONSEQUENCE OF THE INCREASING STRAIN IS RACE SUICIDE WHICH IS SIMPLY A POPULAR TERM FOR THAT ELIMINATION OF THE MIDDLE CLASS WHICH KARL MARX PREDICTED HALF A CENTURY AGO THE HOMILIES OF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT MAY HAVE CAUSED A FEW MORE SUPERFLUOUS BOURGEOIS BABIES TO BE BORN BUT I RATHER FANCY THAT IN GENERAL IT HAS BEEN A CASE OF EVERYBODYS BUSINESS AND NOBODYS BUSINESSTHAT THE AVERAGE MIDDLECLASS AMERICAN HAS NO IDEA OF LOWERING HIS STANDARD OF LIVING FOR THE PURPOSE OF AFFECTING THE CENSUS RETURNS AS A RESULT OF A CONFIDENTIAL CENSUS OF RACE SUICIDE TAKEN IN ENGLAND AND REPORTED IN THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY MR SIDNEY WEBB FOUND THAT THE OFFSPRING HAD BEEN VOLUNTARILY LIMITED IN TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTYFOUR CASES OUT OF A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTYTWO MARRIAGES AND OUT OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYEIGHT CASES IN WHICH THE CAUSES OF LIMITATION WERE GIVEN ECONOMIC CAUSES WERE SPECIFIED IN SEVENTYTHREE SIMILAR RESULTS WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW AN INQUIRY IN THIS COUNTRY IN FACT AMERICANS OF REFINEMENT HAVE COME TO HAVE AN INSTINCTIVE FEELING OF REPUGNANCE TO A LARGE FAMILY TO HAVE SIX OR SEVEN CHILDREN IS VULGAR AND COMMON AND SUGGESTIVE OF FOREIGNERS THE REASON IS SIMPLY THAT CONDITIONS NOW PREVAIL WHICH MAKE LARGE FAMILIES IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPT TO POLES AND HUNGARIANS AND ITALIANS AND FRENCHCANADIANS PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO IGNORANT TO LIMIT THEIR OFFSPRING AND WHOSE STANDARDS OF LIFE ARE CLOSE TO ANIMALSTHEIR CHILDREN EARNING THEIR OWN LIVINGS IN SWEATSHOPS MINES AND

SOUTH IF IT DID NOT ACTUALLY CRUSH THEM I MADE AN EFFORT IN THE JUNGLE TO SHOW WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE WAGE EARNER IN OUR MODERN HIGHLY CONCENTRATED INDUSTRIES UNDER THE RGIME OF A MONOPOLY PRICE AND A COMPETITIVE WAGE I SPENT SEVEN WEEKS IN PACKINGTOWN STUDYING CONDITIONS THERE AND I VERIFIED EVERY SMALLEST DETAIL SO THAT AS A PICTURE OF SOCIAL CONDITIONS THE BOOK IS AS EXACT AS A GOVERNMENT REPORT BUT THE READER DOES NOT HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF STUDIES BY INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATORS LET HIM GO TO A LIBRARY AND CONSULT THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY FOR MARCH AND READ THE REPORTS OF A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO WHO INVESTIGATED THE CONDITIONS IN THE GARMENTTRADE IN THAT CITY HERE WERE GIRLS WORKING TEN HOURS A DAY FOR FORTY CENTS A WEEK THE

THE DEATH RATE WAS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTYTHREE PER THOUSAND WHILE WITH FAMILIES LIVING IN THREE OR FOUR ROOMS IT WAS TWENTY WHAT IT WAS WITH THREE OR FOUR FAMILIES LIVING IN ONE ROOM DOES NOT APPEAR ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT OF THE NEW YORK TENEMENT HOUSE COMMISSION THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DARK ROOMSROOMS WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE OPENING WHATEVER MR RIIS HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN BATTLING WITH SUCH CONDITIONS THAT HE HAS BEEN CALLED BY PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT THE MOST USEFUL AMERICAN NEITHER THE PRESIDENT NOR MR RIIS UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS AND SO PROBABLY THEY ARE BOTH PERPLEXED AT THE RESULT OF HIS TEN YEARS OF EFFORTWHICH IS THAT RENTS ON THE EAST SIDE HAVE GONE UP ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND THERE HAVE BEEN RIOTS AND EVICTIONSAND A SOCIALIST ALL BUT ELECTED TO CONGRESS BUT MR RIIS IS A BUSINESS MAN AND HE CAN FIGURE THE SOCIAL COST OF THESE EVIL CONDITIONS OF THE NEW YORK TENEMENTS HE WRITES THEY ARE THE HOT BEDS OF EPIDEMICS THAT CARRY DEATH TO THE RICH AND POOR ALIKE THE NURSERIES OF PAUPERISM AND CRIME THAT FILL OUR JAILS AND POLICE COURTS THAT THROW OFF A SCUM OF FORTY THOUSAND HUMAN WRECKS TO THE ISLAND ASYLUMS AND WORKHOUSES YEAR BY YEAR THAT TURNED OUT IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS A ROUND HALF MILLION BEGGARS TO PREY UPON OUR CHARITIES THAT MAINTAIN A STANDING ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND TRAMPS WITH ALL THAT THAT IMPLIES BECAUSE ABOVE ALL THEY TAINT THE FAMILY LIFE WITH DEADLY MORAL CONTAGION IN HIS NEWLY PUBLISHED DISCUSSION OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS CALLED IN THE FIRE OF THE HEART MR RALPH WALDO TRINE WRITES OF THE COUNTRYS SITUATION AS FOLLOWS AND OVER TEN MILLIONS OF OUR PEOPLE ARE IN A STATE OF CHRONIC POVERTY AT THIS VERY HOURALMOST ONE OUT OF EVERY SEVEN OR TO MAKE FULL ALLOWANCE ONE OUT OF EVERY EIGHT OF ALL OUR PEOPLE ARE IN THE CONDITION WHERE THEY HAVE NOT SUFFICIENT FOOD AND CLOTHING AND SHELTER TO KEEP THEM IN A STATE OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EFFICIENCY AND THE SAD PART OF IT IS THAT LARGE ADDITIONAL NUMBERSNUMBERS MOST APPALLING FOR SUCH A COUNTRY AS THIS ARE EACH YEAR AND THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN DROPPING INTO THIS SAME CONDITION AND A STILL SADDER FEATURE OF IT IS THAT EACH YEAR INCREASINGLY LARGE NUMBERS OF THIS VAST ARMY OF PEOPLE OUR FELLOWBEINGS ARE UNWILLINGLY ON THEIR PART AND IN THE FACE OF ALMOST SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS TO KEEP OUT OF IT TILL THE LAST MOMENT DROPPING INTO THE PAUPER CLASSTHOSE WHO ARE COMPELLED TO SEEK OR TO RECEIVE AID FROM A PUBLIC OR FROM PRIVATE CHARITY IN ORDER TO EXIST AT ALL ALREADY IN NUMBERS ABOUT FOUR MILLION WHILE INCREASING NUMBERS OF THIS CLASS THE PAUPER SINK EACH YEAR AND SO NATURALLY INTO THE VICIOUS THE CRIMINAL THE INEBRIATE CLASS IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE GRADUALLY ALLOWED TO BE BUILT AROUND US A SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM WHICH YEARLY DRIVES VAST NUMBERS OF HITHERTO FAIRLY WELLTODO STRONG HONEST EARNEST WILLING AND ADMIRABLE MEN WITH THEIR FAMILIES INTO THE CONDITION OF POVERTY AND UNDER ITS WEARY ENDEAVOURSTRANGLING INFLUENCES MANY OF THESE IN TIME HOPING AGAINST HOPE STRUGGLING TO THE LAST MOMENT IN THEIR SEMIINCAPACITATED AND PATHETIC MANNER TO KEEP OUT OF IT ARE FORCED TO SEEK OR TO ACCEPT PUBLIC OR PRIVATE CHARITY AND THUS SINK INTO THE PAUPER CLASS IT IS A WELLAUTHENTICATED FACT THAT STRONG MEN NOW WEAKENED BY POVERTY WILL AVOID IT TO THE LAST BEFORE THEY WILL TAKE THIS STEP MANY AFTER FIRST PARTING WITH EVERY THING THEY HAVE BREAK DOWN AND CRY LIKE BABES WHEN THE FINAL MOMENT COMES AND THEY CAN AVOID IT NO LONGER NUMBERS AT THIS TIME TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES RATHER THAN PASS THROUGH THE ORDEAL AND STILL LARGER NUMBERS DESERT THEIR FAMILIES FOR WHOM THEY HAVE STRUGGLED SO VALIANTLYIT IS ALMOST INVARIABLY THE WOMAN WHO MAKES HER WAY TO THE CHARITY AGENCIES THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CHARITIES COST THE COUNTRY DURING THE PAST YEAR AS NEARLY AS CAN BE CONSERVATIVELY ARRIVED AT OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MOREOVER A STRANGE LAW SEEMS TO WORK WITH AN ACCURACY THAT SEEMS ALMOST MARVELLOUS IT IS THIS NOTWITHSTANDING THE BRAVE AND ALMOST SUPERHUMAN STRUGGLES THAT ARE GONE THROUGH WITH ON THE PART OF THESE BEFORE THEY CAN TAKE THEMSELVES TO THE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE CHARITY FOR AID WHEN THE STEP IS ONCE TAKEN THEY GRADUALLY SINK INTO THE CONDITION WHERE ALL INITIATIVE AND ALL SENSE OF SELFRELIANCE SEEMS TO BE STIFLED OR LOST AND IT IS ONLY IN A RARE CASE NOW AND THEN THAT THEY EVER CEASE TO BE DEPENDENT BUT REMAIN CONTENT WITH THE ALMS THAT ARE DOLED OUT TO THEMPRACTICALLY NEVER DO THEY RISE OUT OF THAT CONDITION AGAIN TALK WITH PRACTICALLY ANY CHARITY AGENT OR WORKER ONE WITH A SUFFICIENTLY EXTENDED EXPERIENCE AND YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE IS SCARCELY MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF TESTIMONY CONCERNING THIS AND AS THIS CONDITION GRADUALLY BECOMES CHRONIC AND ENDEAVOUR AND INITIATIVE AND SELFRESPECT ARE LOST A CERTAIN PROPORTION THEN SINK INTO THE CONDITION OF THE CRIMINAL THE DISEASED THE CHRONICALLY DRUNK THE INEBRIATE FROM WHICH RECLAMATION IS STILL MORE DIFFICULT THE FULLEST AND MOST AUTHORITATIVE TREATISE UPON CONDITIONS IN AMERICA IS OF COURSE MR ROBERT HUNTERS POVERTY MR HUNTER IS A SETTLEMENT WORKER AND HE HAS GATHERED HIS MATERIAL IN THE MIDST OF THE CONDITIONS OF WHICH HE WRITES HE QUOTES FOR INSTANCE THE FOLLOWING DEFINITE FACTS WHICH ARE OBTAINED FROM OFFICIAL SOURCES TWENTY PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE OF BOSTON IN DISTRESS NINETEEN PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK STATE IN DISTRESS EIGHTEEN PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK STATE IN DISTRESS FOURTEEN PER CENT OF THE FAMILIES OF MANHATTAN EVICTED EVERY YEAR TEN PER CENT ABOUT OF THOSE WHO DIE IN MANHATTAN HAVE PAUPER BURIALS ON THE BASIS OF THESE FIGURES MR HUNTER CONTINUES IT WOULD SEEM FAIR TO ESTIMATE THAT CERTAINLY NOT LESS THAN FOURTEEN PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE IN PROSPEROUS TIMES AND PROBABLY NOT LESS THAN TWENTY PER CENT IN BAD TIMES ARE IN DISTRESS THE ESTIMATE IS A CONSERVATIVE ONE FOR DESPITE ALL THE IMPERFECTIONS WHICH MAY BE FOUND IN THE DATA AND THERE ARE MANY ANY ALLOWANCE FOR THE PERSONS WHO ARE GIVEN AID BY SOURCES NOT REPORTING TO THE STATE BOARD OR FOR THOSE PERSONS NOT AIDED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF BOSTON OR FOR THOSE PERSONS WHO ALTHOUGH IN GREAT DISTRESS ARE NOT EVICTED MUST COUNTERBALANCE THE DUPLICATIONS OR ERRORS WHICH MAY EXIST IN THE FIGURES EITHER OF DISTRESS OR EVICTIONS THESE FIGURES FURTHERMORE REPRESENT ONLY THE DISTRESS WHICH MANIFESTS ITSELF THERE IS NO QUESTION BUT THAT ONLY A PART OF THOSE IN POVERTY IN ANY COMMUNITY APPLY FOR CHARITY I THINK ANYONE LIVING IN A SETTLEMENT WILL SUPPORT ME IN SAYING THAT MANY FAMILIES WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY POORTHAT IS UNDERFED UNDERCLOTHED OR BADLY HOUSEDNEVER ASK FOR AID OR SUFFER THE SOCIAL DISGRACE OF EVICTION OF COURSE NO ONE COULD ESTIMATE THE PROPORTION OF THOSE WHO ARE EVICTED OR OF THOSE WHO ASK ASSISTANCE TO THE TOTAL NUMBER IN POVERTY FOR WHATEVER OPINION ONE MAY HAVE FORMED IS BASED NOT ON ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE GAINED BY INQUIRY BUT ON IMPRESSIONS GAINED THROUGH FRIENDLY INTERCOURSE MY OWN OPINION IS THAT PROBABLY NOT OVER HALF OF THOSE IN POVERTY EVER APPLY FOR CHARITY AND CERTAINLY NOT MORE THAN THAT PROPORTION ARE EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES HOWEVER I SHOULD NOT WISH AN OPINION OF THIS SORT TO BE USED IN ESTIMATING FROM THE FIGURES OF DISTRESS ETC THE NUMBER OF THOSE IN POVERTY AND YET FROM THE FACTS OF DISTRESS AS GIVEN AND FROM OPINIONS FORMED BOTH AS A CHARITY AGENT AND AS A SETTLEMENT WORKER I SHOULD NOT BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF THE NUMBER OF THOSE IN POVERTY IN NEW YORK AS WELL AS IN OTHER LARGE CITIES AND INDUSTRIAL CENTRES RARELY FELL BELOW TWENTYFIVE PER CENT OF ALL THE PEOPLE SUCH ARE THE CONDITIONS IN AMERICA TODAY WHAT THEY WOULD BE IN THE FUTURE IF PRESENT TENDENCIES WENT ON UNCHECKED THE READER MAY LEARN BY GOING TO EUROPE WHERE INDUSTRIAL EVOLUTION HAS BEEN SLOWER IN COMING TO A HEAD AND WHERE THE PEOPLE HAVE

CHEERFUL SNEER AND THEN TURN BACK TO THE PREFACE IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE TIME OF WHICH I WRITE WAS CONSIDERED GOOD TIMES IN ENGLAND THE STARVATION AND LACK OF SHELTER I ENCOUNTERED CONSTITUTED A CHRONIC CONDITION OF MISERY WHICH IS NEVER WIPED OUT EVEN IN THE PERIODS OF GREATEST PROSPERITY FOLLOWING THE SUMMER IN QUESTION CAME A HARD WINTER TO SUCH AN EXTENT DID THE SUFFERING

RESIDENTS OF THE GARRETS AND CELLARS OF LONDON LANES AND ALLEYS AND THEN CONSIDER THAT IN THE CITY WHERE THIS WAS GOING ON THE LEADING NEWSPAPER THE TIMES WAS PRINTING A THREECOLUMN ARTICLE SETTING FORTH THE FACT THAT COMPETITION HAD GROWN SO GREAT THAT IT WAS NOW NO LONGER POSSIBLE FOR A GENTLEMAN TO MAINTAIN HIS STATUS WITH A FAMILY IN LONDON UPON AN INCOME OF HALF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR YET

THEM SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWO YEARS TO MR WILLIAM WALDORF ASTOR ALONE THE HARRIED AND OVERDRIVEN POPULATION OF MANHATTAN ISLAND DELIVERS EIGHT OR TEN MILLIONS OF TRIBUTE MONEY EVERY YEAR AND MR WILLIAM WALDORF ASTOR RESIDES AT CLIEVEDEN TAPLOW BUCKS ENGLANDGIVING AS HIS REASON THE FACT THAT AMERICA IT NOT A FIT PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN TO LIVE IN THE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE RGIME UNDER WHICH WE LIVE IS THAT IT VALUES A MAN ONLY IN SO FAR AS HE IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING WEALTH HENCE ONE OF THE SIGNS OF THE INCREASING DIFFICULTY OF MAKING PROFITS WILL BE AN INCREASING RECKLESSNESS OF HUMAN LIFE OUR RAILROADS KILLED SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SEVEN THOUSAND IN EIGHT THOUSAND IN NINE THOUSAND IN AND TEN THOUSAND IN THEY INJURED THIRTYTHREE THOUSAND IN FORTYFOUR THOUSAND IN SIXTYFOUR THOUSAND IN SEVENTYSIX THOUSAND IN AND EIGHTYFOUR THOUSAND IN ACCORDING TO THE STATISTICS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION OUR RAILWAYS INJURED ONE PASSENGER OUT OF EVERY ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTYTHREE THOUSAND PASSENGERS THEY CARRIED IN IN THEY INJURED ONE OUT OF EVERY SEVENTYEIGHT THOUSAND IF CASUALTIES ARE TO CONTINUE INCREASING AT THE SAME RATE UNTIL THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE UNDER SENTENCE OF SUDDEN DEATH AND A NUMBER DOOMED TO BE MAIMED GREATER THAN THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DELAWARE MONTANA ARIZONA NEVADA WYOMING ALASKA IDAHO AND THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS IN BEFORE THE PRESENT APPALLING SLAUGHTER BEGAN WE WERE KILLING OF A GIVEN NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES TWICE AS MANY AS THE STATEOWNED ROADS OF GERMANY AND THREE TIMES AS MANY AS AUSTRIA THE STREET RAILROADS OF NEW YORK CITY ALONE TAKE ONE HUMAN LIFE EVERY DAY OR ONE IN TEN THOUSAND OF THE POPULATION EVERY YEAR PEOPLE WALK ABOUT THE STREETS CARELESSLY BUT TREMBLE WHEN THERE IS A THUNDERSTORM YET THE STREETCARS KILL TEN PERSONS IN A YEAR FOR EVERY ONE THAT THE LIGHTNING KILLS IN THE LIFETIME OF A MAN THESE THINGS CREATE INDIGNATION IN OUR PULPITS AND EDITORIAL ROOMS BUT ANY PRACTICAL RAILROAD MAN COULD TELL YOU THAT TO STOP THEM WOULD BE TO OVERTHROW SOCIETY THE REASON THEY OCCUR IS THAT IT COSTS LESS TO PAY THE DAMAGES THAN IT WOULD TO TAKE PROPER PRECAUTIONS AND IF THE RAILROADS WERE FORCED TO TAKE THE PRECAUTIONS MANY OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO SHUT DOWN AT ONCE THE SITUATION IS COVERED SO COMPLETELY IN THE FOLLOWING NEWS ITEM CLIPPED FROM THE MINNEAPOLIS JOURNAL OF MAY THAT I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN TO QUOTE IT ENTIRE BECAUSE JAMES J HILL GUARANTEED EIGHT PER CENT TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE BURLINGTON WHEN HE ASSUMED CONTROL OF THAT SYSTEM MANY OF THE OLDER EMPLOYEES ARE UNDERGOING WHAT THEY CONSIDER REAL HARDSHIP TEN DAYS AGO THE JOURNAL VOICED THE COMPLAINTS OF BURLINGTON EMPLOYEES ON OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM MENTIONING THE FACT THAT THE RUNS TO AND FROM THE TWIN CITIES HAD BEEN COMBINED IN SOME WAY TO SQUEEZE MORE WORK OUT OF THE TRAIN CREWS THE NEW SCHEDULE HAS NOW BEEN IN EFFECT LONGER AND COMPLAINTS ARE CORRESPONDINGLY MORE EMPHATIC NO DISSATISFACTION IS OPENLY EXPRESSED AS THE HILL GUILLOTINE GETS NOBODY MORE SURELY THAN THE MAN WHO TALKS TOO MUCH TRAINMEN COMPLAIN THAT WITH THE LONG RUNS AND LONG HOURS THEY ARE FORCED TO WORK TO A POINT ALMOST BEYOND HUMAN ENDURANCE THEY ARE HAUNTED BY THE FEAR OF ACCIDENTS FROM UNPREVENTABLE NEGLECT OF DUTY THEY HOLD THAT THE RUNNING OF TRAINS IN SAFETY DEPENDS UPON THE VIGILANCE AND ALERTNESS OF THE CREWS AND THEY CANNOT DO THEMSELVES AND THEIR EMPLOYERS JUSTICE WHEN COMPELLED TO WORK LONG HOURS ON FAST RUNS CREWS ARE NOW RUNNING FROM MINNEAPOLIS TO CHICAGO A DISTANCE OF ABOUT MILES WITH SEVENTYTWO STOPS THE MEN START FROM MINNEAPOLIS AT A M AND ARRIVE ON LOCALS IN CHICAGO AT P M THE MEN LEAVING CHICAGO ON NO AT P M ARRIVE IN MINNEAPOLIS AT P M THE NEXT AFTERNOON TRAINMEN DECLARE THAT IN MAKING THIS SCHEDULE THE MANAGEMENT HAS BROKEN FAITH AND VIRTUALLY ABROGATES PREVIOUS WORKING AGREEMENTS HINTS OF A STRIKE ARE MADE IN DISCUSSING THE CONDITIONS AN OLD BURLINGTON EMPLOYEE SAID A CONDUCTOR AND HIS CREW FEEL A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LIVES OF THOSE UPON A TRAIN A MAN CAN ONLY BE WORKED SO FAR WHEN HE BECOMES ACTUALLY IRRESPONSIBLE I HATE TO FEEL THAT I AM IN ANY WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LIVES OF PASSENGERS ON A TRAIN WHEN THE LENGTH OF THE RUN AND HOURS HAVE WORKED ME BEYOND MY LIMIT THERE IS NO FLAGMAN ON THE TRAIN AND THE BRAKEMAN HAS TO HELP LOAD BAGGAGE BRAKE FLAG AND DO ANYTHING THAT COMES UP HE IS CERTAINLY NOT IN GOOD CONDITION TO BE AN ALERT FLAGMAN ON THE LATTER END OF THE RUN FOOTNOTE IN THE MATTER OF RIGGING THE STOCKMARKET THE AMERICAN RAILROAD MANAGER HAS NO SUPERIOR IN THE MATTER OF PROVIDING SAFE AND EXPEDITIOUS FACILITIES FOR TRANSPORTATION HE HAS NO INFERIOR IN ANY NATION OF THE FIRST RANK HE CAN MANIPULATE POLITICAL CONVENTIONS HE CAN DEBAUCH LEGISLATURES HE CAN SEND HIS PAID ATTORNEYS TO CONGRESS AND SOMETIMES PUT THEM ON THE BENCH IN THESE MATTERS HE IS A MASTER JUST AS HE IS A MASTER IN THE ART OF ISSUING AND JUGGLING SECURITIES IT IS ONLY IN THE OPERATION OF RAILROADS THAT HE IS DEFICIENT THE MERE DETAIL OF TRANSPORTING LIVES AND PROPERTY SAFELY AND SATISFACTORILY HE SEEMS TO REGARD AS UNWORTHY OF HIS GENIUS HIS EQUIPMENT IS USUALLY INADEQUATE HIS ROADBED IS GENERALLY SECOND CLASS OR WORSE HIS EMPLOYEES ARE UNDISCIPLINED AND HIS SYSTEM IS ARCHAIC WHATEVER THE CAUSES MAY BE THE FACT REMAINS THAT JUDGED BY THE RESULTS OF OPERATION THE AMERICAN RAILROAD MANAGER IS INCOMPETENT AND THE RECORDS OF DEATH AND DISASTER PROVE ITNEW YORK WORLD IN THE SAME WAY IT IS CHEAPER FOR A THEATREMANAGER TO BRIBE POLICE OFFICIALS WITH FREE TICKETS THAN TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND SO IT IS THAT FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE BURNED UP IN FIVE MINUTES IT IS EASIER TO BRIBE A BUILDING INSPECTOR THAN IT IS TO PUT STEEL RIVETS IN A BUILDING AND SO YOU HAVE A DARLINGTON HOTEL COLLAPSE AND KILL TEN OR TWENTY WORKINGMEN AND A FEW WEEKS LATER CAME THE SLOCUM DISASTER AND A HELPLESS STEAMBOAT CAPTAIN WAS PUNISHED AND THE RESPONSIBLE CAPITALISTS NOT EVEN NAMED AT THE SAME TIME IN TRENTON NEW JERSEY SOME OTHER CAPITALISTS WERE ARRESTED FOR MAKING LIFEPRESERVERS WITH IRON BARS IN THEM OF COURSE THEY WERE NOT PUNISHED FOR EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT SUCH THINGS CANNOT BE HELPED IN THE NUMBER OF MINERS KILLED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA WAS TWO AND FIFTYTHREE HUNDREDTHS PER THOUSAND IN IT WAS THREE AND FIFTYONE HUNDREDTHS BETTER PRECAUTIONS AGAINST ACCIDENTS WERE ONE OF THE DEMANDS FOR MAKING WHICH THE MINERS OF COLORADO WERE STRUNG UP TO TELEGRAPH POLES SHUT IN BULLPENS BEATEN AND DEPORTED THEIR MORTALITY WAS THIRTYTWO PER THOUSAND IN TEN YEARS THE MORTALITY AMONG RAILROAD BRAKEMEN IS NOW THIRTYTWO PER THOUSAND IN TWO YEARS SO IT WAS VERY UNREASONABLE OF THE MINERS TO COMPLAIN THERE ARE ANNUALLY SAYS SOCIAL SERVICE ACCIDENTS AMONG THE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN THIS COUNTRY IN MANUFACTURING AND MECHANICAL PURSUITS IT CALCULATES THAT IF THE PERCENTAGE OF ACCIDENTS AMONG THE OTHER EMPLOYED IN OTHER OCCUPATIONS IS ONLY ONETENTH AS MUCH AS THE ABOVE IT MEANS THAT ANOTHER MUST BE ADDED TO THE LIST THIS IS PERPETUAL WAR ON HUMANITY THE PAPER GOES ON TO SAY AND MORE BLOODY THAN ANY CIVIL OR INTERNATIONAL WAR KNOWN TO HISTORY THIS WAR IS COSTING SUFFERING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WHICH IS BEYOND CALCULATION IT IS COSTING GREAT ECONOMIC LOSS IT IS CREATING A SENSE OF WRONG AND A FEELING OF CLASSHATRED ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO ARE ITS VICTIMS IN THE SAME CATEGORY OF WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE BELONG ALL THE FACTS OF OVERDRIVING LONG HOURS AND IRREGULAR EMPLOYMENT AMONG WORKINGMEN UNDER THE OLD SOUTHERN SYSTEM OF SLAVERY THE MASTER TOOK CARE OF HIS SERVANT THE YEAR ROUND BUT THE WAGESLAVE IS KEPT ONLY WHILE HE IS NEEDED AND ONLY WHILE HE REMAINS AT HIS MAXIMUM OF WORKING EFFICIENCY RECENTLY IN A SINGLE MONTH I CLIPPED FROM A NEW YORK NEWSPAPER ITEMS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE BROOKLYN STREETRAILROAD COMBINE WAS DISCHARGING ALL OF ITS SUPERANNUATED EMPLOYEES THAT THE MASTERPILOTS OF THE GREAT LAKES HAD AGREED TO ENGAGE NO MAN OVER FORTY THAT THE DELAWARE AND HUDSON RAILROAD COMPANY HAD JUST PUBLISHED A RULE BARRING ALL OVER THIRTYFIVE AND THAT THE CARNEGIE STEEL COMPANY HAD DONE THE SAME AND IN THIS SAME CATEGORY OF WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE BELONG ALL THE FACTS OF WOMAN AND CHILDLABOUR FOR OF COURSE THE CHILDREN DIE AND THE WOMEN PRODUCE DEFORMED AND IDIOT AND DEGENERATE OFFSPRING TO FILL OUR ASYLUMS AND PRISONS THE READER IS REFERRED FOR FIRSTHAND ACCOUNTS OF THE LIFE OF THE AMERICAN WOMAN WAGESLAVE TO VAN VORSTS THE WOMAN WHO TOILS AND TO THAT FASCINATING HUMAN DOCUMENT THE LONG DAY IN MR JOHN SPARGOS THE BITTER CRY OF THE CHILDREN HE WILL FIND A MASS OF FACTS ABOUT CHILDLABOUR THE MOST HIDEOUS OF ALL THE EVILS INCIDENTAL TO THE PROCESS OF WEALTHCONCENTRATION THERE IS IF ONE HAD ONLY TIME TO POINT IT OUT NO TINIEST NOOK OF OUR SOCIETY WHERE HUMAN LIVES ARE NOT BEING GROUND UP FOR PROFIT THE CAPITALISTS ARE GROUND UP AS MR SCHWAB WAS AND THE MEANEST WOMAN OF THE TOWN SHARES HIS FATE THERE WAS A TIME WHEN A PROSTITUTE WAS AN INDEPENDENT PERSON WHO COULD SUPPORT HERSELF UNTIL SHE GREW OLD NOWADAYS UNDER THE STRESS OF COMPETITION EVERY CITY HAS ITS PROSTITUTION TRUST IT TAKES CAPITAL TO PAY THE POLICE AND THE BUSINESS IS THEREFORE IN THE HANDS OF THE PROPRIETORS OF HOUSES WHO BUY YOUNG GIRLS OUT OF THE SLUMS AND IMMIGRANT POPULATION BY THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS USE THEM UP IN A YEAR OR TWO AND THEN FLING THEM OUT INTO THE GUTTERS TO DIE OFTEN WHEN THEY ARE NOT OUT OF THEIR TEENS IN THE SAME WAY THE GAMBLER AND THE SALOONKEEPER ARE NOW AS MUCH EMPLOYEES AS ARE THE OFFICIALS OF THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY THE WHOLE PROFITS OF THESE OCCUPATIONS FLOWING INTO THE HANDS OF SOME CAPTAIN OF INDUSTRY AS INEVITABLY AS ALL THE RILLS ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE FLOW INTO THE RIVER ALL OF THESE FACTS ARE PERFECTLY FAMILIAR BUT FOR THE SAKE OF CONCRETENESS I WILL QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM MR STEFFENSS BOOK THE SHAME OF THE CITIES HE IS TELLING OF THE CITY OF PITTSBURG THE VICEGRAFT IS A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS CONDUCTED NOT BY THE POLICE BUT IN AN ORDERLY FASHION BY SYNDICATES AND THE CHAIRMAN OF ONE OF THE PARTIES AT THE LAST ELECTION SAID IT WAS WORTH TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR I SAW A MAN WHO WAS LAUGHED AT FOR OFFERING SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE SLOTMACHINE CONCESSION HE WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS LET FOR MUCH MORE SPEAKEASIES UNLICENSED DRINKING PLACES PAY SO WELL THAT WHEN THEY EARN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE IN TWENTYFOUR HOURS THEIR PROPRIETORS OFTEN MAKE A BARE LIVING DISORDERLY HOUSES ARE MANAGED BY WARD SYNDICATES PERMISSION IS HAD FROM THE SYNDICATE REALESTATE AGENT WHO ALONE CAN RENT THEM THE SYNDICATE HIRES A HOUSE FROM THE OWNERS AT SAY THIRTYFIVE DOLLARS A MONTH AND HE LETS IT TO A WOMAN AT FROM THIRTYFIVE TO FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK FOR FURNITURE THE TENANT MUST GO TO THE OFFICIAL FURNITUREMAN WHO DELIVERS ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF FIXINGS FOR A NOTE FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON WHICH HIGH INTEREST MUST BE PAID FOR BEER THE TENANT MUST GO TO THE OFFICIAL BOTTLER AND PAY TWO DOLLARS FOR A ONEDOLLAR CASE OF BEER FOR WINES AND LIQUORS TO THE OFFICIAL LIQUORCOMMISSIONER WHO CHARGES TEN DOLLARS FOR FIVE DOLLARS WORTH FOR CLOTHES TO THE OFFICIAL WRAPPERMAKER THESE WOMEN MAY NOT BUY SHOES HATS JEWELLERY OR ANY OTHER LUXURY OR NECESSITY EXCEPT FROM THE OFFICIAL CONCESSIONARIES AND THEN ONLY AT THE OFFICIAL MONOPOLY PRICES AND BY WAY OF CONCLUSION IN REFERENCE TO THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE INCREASING MASS OF CAPITAL LET ME QUOTE THE FOLLOWING LITTLE INCIDENT WHICH A FRIEND OF MINE CLIPPED FROM ONE OF THE NEW YORK NEWSPAPERS ONE NIGHT A YOUNG GIRL CALLED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE OF THE GOOD SHEPHERD IN NEW YORK CITY SHE ASKED FOR FOOD AND A PLACE TO SLEEP TWAS A PITIFUL TALE SHE TOLD THE MATRON IN CHARGE SHE TOLD OF HER PARENTS HAVING DIED AND LEFT HER ALONE IN THE GREAT DARK CITY SHE TOLD OF JOBS SHE HAD SECURED BUT WAS DISCHARGED OWING TO HER PHYSICAL INABILITY TO KEEP PACE WITH THE MACHINE AND AS A LAST RESORT SHE APPEALED TO THIS INSTITUTION FOR SUCCOUR AND SUPPORT THE MATRON IN ATTENDANCE AFTER HAVING HEARD THIS TERRIBLE TALE OF WOE AND BEING THOROUGHLY CONVINCED AS TO THE GIRLS HONESTY AND INTEGRITY AS WELL AS TO HER VIRTUE INFORMED HER THAT SHE COULD NOT TAKE HER IN THERE AS THAT INSTITUTION WAS ESTABLISHED FOR THE RECLAMATION OF FALLEN WOMEN ONLY THE POOR GIRL WENT AWAY BUT ON THE FOLLOWING NIGHT SHE RETURNED YOU MAY TAKE ME NOW SHE SAID YOU MAY TAKE ME NOW FOR I AM A FALLEN WOMAN CHAPTER V BUSINESS AND POLITICS IN THIS DISCUSSION OF THE PROCESS OF WEALTHCONCENTRATION I HAVE SO FAR PURPOSELY OMITTED ALL MENTION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE PHENOMENONTHE SEIZING BY THE CONSTANTLY INCREASING MASS OF CAPITAL OF THE POWERS OF THE STATE AND THEIR USE FOR PURPOSE OF INTENSIFYING EXPLOITATION I HAVE AVOIDED THAT FEATURE PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH TO DESERVE A CHAPTER TO ITSELF BUT MAINLY IN ORDER TO MAKE CLEAR MY VIEWPOINT THAT THE PHENOMENON WHILE IMPORTANT IS SECONDARYAN EFFECT RATHER THAN A CAUSE THIS IS OF COURSE CONTRARY TO THE VIEW USUALLY TAKEN IN MOST DISCUSSIONS OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE TIME IT IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT GOVERNMENT BY SPECIAL INTERESTS IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THE EVIL BUT WHILE RECOGNISING HOW ENORMOUSLY THE PROCESS OF WEALTH CONCENTRATION HAS BEEN ACCELERATED BY THE POLITICAL ALLIANCE IT IS MY THESIS THAT EXACTLY THE SAME CONDITIONS WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED HAD ECONOMIC FORCES BEEN LEFT TO WORK OUT THEIR OWN RESULTS I MAINTAIN THAT ECONOMIC COMPETITION IS A SELFDESTROYING STAGE IN SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND THAT TO REGARD IT AS PERMANENT IS SIMPLY NOT TO REALISE WHAT IT IS FOR COMPETITION IS A STRUGGLE AND THE PURPOSE OF EVERY STRUGGLE IS A VICTORY TO CONCEIVE OF A STRUGGLE WITHOUT THE INTENTION TO END THE STRUGGLE IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE IN THE NATURE OF THINGS IN THE INDUSTRIAL COMBAT THE END IS THE VICTORY OF A CLASS AND THE REDUCTION OF ALL OTHER CLASSES TO SERVITUDEWITH THE ULTIMATE EXTINCTION OF ALL INDIVIDUALS NOT NEEDED BY THE VICTORS AGAIN IT IS GENERALLY THE CUSTOM TO REGARD THIS PHENOMENON OF CLASSGOVERNMENT WITH INDIGNATION AND ASTONISHMENT AS IF IT WERE SOMETHING ABNORMAL AND MONSTROUS BUT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THIS DISCUSSION IT IS A PERFECTLY NATURAL AND INEVITABLE INCIDENT OF THE INTENSIFICATION OF COMPETITION YOU ARE TO PICTURE CAPITAL SEEKING PROFITS LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE PACING ABOUT WATCHING FOR AN OPENING HERE AND THERE LIKE WATER CAUGHT BEHIND A DAM CREEPING UP CROWDING FORWARD FEELING FOR A WEAK SPOT AND THE ONE THING TO BE DETERMINED IS IS THERE ANY WAY IN WHICH PROFITS CAN BE MADE THROUGH THE POWERS OF GOVERNMENT IF SO IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THERE WILL BE AN ATTEMPT MADE BY CAPITAL TO GET POSSESSION OF THOSE POWERS YOU CAN SEE THE THING IN ITS GERM IN ANY PRIMITIVE COMMUNITY I ONCE AMUSED MYSELF BY STUDYING IT IN A LITTLE VILLAGE IN CANADA WHERE THE TRUSTS HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF THE STOREKEEPER WAS A RICH MAN AND HE HAD A PULL WITH THE SQUIRE AND WITH THE CONSTABLE AND WITH THE GAMEWARDEN HE DID LITTLE FAVOURS FOR THEM AND THEY FOR HIMSO THAT A POOR FRENCHMAN WHO WAS SUSPECTED OF STEALING A PAIR OF SOCKS FOUND HIMSELF IN JAIL BEFORE HE KNEW WHY AND THEN THERE WAS A BIG LUMBER MAN IN THE TOWNSHIP HE OWNED ALL THE JOBS AND HE TRADED WITH THE STOREKEEPER AND THE STOREKEEPER IN RETURN RAN THE POLITICAL MACHINE THAT WAS THE WHOLE STORY OF THE POLITICS OF THE DISTRICTEXCEPT THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL FELLOWS OF INDEPENDENT TEMPERAMENT WHO GRUMBLED AND WHO CONSTITUTED THE GERM OF THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT POLITICAL CORRUPTION FIRST BECAME EPIDEMIC IN OUR COUNTRY IN WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO GO INTO BUSINESS UPON AN ENORMOUS SCALE THERE WERE CONTRACTORSAND COMPETITION AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE TARIFF A SHREWD SCHEME TO COMPEL THE PEOPLE TO PAY HIGH PRICES WITHOUT KNOWING IT LATER ON SOMEONE DISCOVERED THE BRILLIANT IDEA OF THE FRANCHISE THE SELLING FOR A NOMINAL SUM OF THE RIGHT TO TAX THE PUBLIC WITHOUT LIMIT AND SO CAPITAL WENT INTO POLITICS AT FIRST IT DID A PURELY RETAIL BUSINESS BUYING UP THE LEGISLATORS AS IT NEEDED THEM BUT SOON THE THING BECAME SYSTEMATISED AND CAPITAL GOT WHOLESALE PRICESIT FINANCED THE MACHINES AND CHOSE ITS OWN CANDIDATES THE PROCESS CULMINATED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT DECADE WHEN BIG BUSINESS WAS IN PRACTICALLY UNDISPUTED POSSESSION OF BOTH THE MAJORITY PARTIES OF CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENCY AND OF THE GOVERNMENTS IN EVERY TOWN CITY AND STATE IN AMERICA YOU SEE IT WAS AS IF OUR SOCIETY WAS IN UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM WE HAD A POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND WE WERE DEVELOPING AN INDUSTRIAL ARISTOCRACY AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO EXIST SIDE BY SIDE INNOCENT PEOPLE HAD TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED THAT THEY COULD BUT IT IS NO MORE POSSIBLE FOR A DEMOCRACY TO BE ARISTOCRATIC IN ANY OF ITS ASPECTS AND REMAIN A DEMOCRACY THAN IT IS FOR A VIRTUOUS MAN TO BE VICIOUS IN ONE PARTICULAR AND REMAIN A VIRTUOUS MAN DEMOCRACY IS NOT A CODE OF LAWS NOR IS IT A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENTIT IS AN ATTITUDE OF SOUL IT HAS AS ITS BASIS A PERCEPTION OF THE SPIRITUAL NATURE OF MAN FROM WHICH FOLLOWS THE COROLLARY THAT ALL MEN EITHER ARE EQUAL OR MUST BECOME SO AND SO BETWEEN ARISTOCRACY AND DEMOCRACY WHEREVER AND UNDER WHATEVER ASPECTS THEY APPEAR THERE IS AND FOREVER MUST BE ETERNAL AND DEADLY WAR HERE IS THE TESTIMONY AND THE WARNING OF THE GREATEST OF AMERICAN DEMOCRATS ABRAHAM LINCOLN WHO IF HE COULD RISE FROM HIS GRAVE TO SPEAK TO US IN THESE TIMES OF OUR COUNTRYS TRIAL COULD SPEAK NO MORE PERTINENT WORDS THAN THESE HE HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLAVERY QUESTION WAS ONE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG RIGHT AND WRONG HE SAIDTHAT IS THE ISSUE THAT WILL CONTINUE IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN THESE POOR TONGUES OF JUDGE DOUGLAS AND MYSELF SHALL BE SILENT IT IS THE ETERNAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN THESE TWO PRINCIPLESRIGHT AND WRONGTHROUGHOUT THE WORLD THEY ARE THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HAVE STOOD FACE TO FACE FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND WILL EVER CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE THE ONE IS THE COMMON RIGHT OF HUMANITY AND THE OTHER IS THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS IT IS THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN WHATEVER SHAPE IT DEVELOPS ITSELF IT IS THE SAME SPIRIT THAT SAYS YOU WORK AND TOIL AND EARN BREAD AND ILL EAT IT NO MATTER IN WHAT SHAPE IT COMES WHETHER FROM THE MOUTH OF A KING WHO SEEKS TO BESTRIDE THE PEOPLE OF HIS OWN NATION AND LIVE BY THE FRUIT OF THEIR LABOUR OR FROM ONE RACE OF MEN AS AN APOLOGY FOR ENSLAVING ANOTHER RACE IT IS THE SAME TYRANNICAL PRINCIPLE IT IS WORTH WHILE POINTING OUT THE UTTER HOPELESSNESS OF THE STRUGGLE ON THE ONE HAND WAS THE CAPITALIST WITH HIS MILLIONS ALERT AGGRESSIVE AND RESOURCEFUL HE HAD AN ARMY OF EXPERTS TO HELP HIMSHREWD ATTORNEYS SKILFUL LOBBYISTS NEWSPAPERS AND PUBLICITY BUREAUS POLITICAL HENCHMEN TRAINED ALL THEIR LIFETIME TO THE TRADE HE WAS COLD AND UNSCRUPULOUSAS A RULE HE WAS NOT A MAN AT ALL BUT A CORPORATION A THING WITHOUT A SOUL A MONSTER CLAMOURING FOR DIVIDENDS HE HAD A THOUSAND DEVICES A THOUSAND PRETENCES A THOUSAND DISGUISES AND OPPOSED TO HIM WAS THE PUBLICUNORGANISED UNINFORMED AND SOUND ASLEEP RECENTLY WHEN MR H G WELLS WAS IN THIS COUNTRY I HAD A LONG TALK WITH HIM AND HE ASKED ME HOW I ACCOUNTED FOR THE SATURNALIA OF CORRUPTION IN OUR POLITICAL LIFE HE SAID THAT OUR PEOPLE DID NOT SEEM TO HIM DEGRADED OR BRUTAL AND HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THINGS WERE SO MUCH WORSE HERE THAN IN ENGLAND I SAID THAT IN ENGLAND THE ECONOMIC PROCESS HAD BEEN MODIFIED BY THE EXISTENCE OF AN HEREDITARY ARISTOCRACY HOLDING OVER FROM OLD TIMES AND HAVING HIGH TRADITIONS OF PUBLIC SERVICE BY NATURE THIS ARISTOCRACY SYMPATHISED WITH CAPITAL AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT FRATERNISED WITH IT BUT IT WOULD NOT ABDICATE TO IT AND OCCASIONALLY TO PRESERVE ITS OWN POWER IT MADE CONCESSIONS TO THE PUBLIC AND SO SERVED AS A CHECK UPON THE FORCES OF COMMERCIALISM ON THE OTHER HAND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAD ONLY THEMSELVES TO RELY UPON AND UNTIL THEY HAD BEEN GOADED INTO REVOLT THERE WAS NO LIMIT WHATEVER TO THE POWER OF GREED I SUPPOSE IT IS UNNECESSARY TO OFFER ANY PROOFS OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOVERNMENT BY SPECIAL INTERESTS IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS AND HAS NOT READ ANY OF THE MAGAZINES IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO REFER HIM TO THE TWO BOOKS OF MR LINCOLN STEFFENSTHE SHAME OF THE CITIES AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SELF GOVERNMENT STEFFENS HIMSELF IS A PROOF OF THE EVIL CONDITIONS A MAN WHO HAS SPENT TEN YEARS STUDYING OUR POLITICS WHO WENT TO THE TASK WITH NO PRECONCEPTIONS AND ONLY A PASSION FOR HONESTY AND FAIR DEALINGAND WHO HAS BEEN MADE INTO A THOROUGHGOING RADICAL BY THE IRRESISTIBLE LOGIC OF FACTS IT WAS HIS PARTICULAR SERVICE TO THE REPUBLIC TO TRACE THE STREAM OF GRAFT TO ITS FOUNTAINHEAD WHICH IS WHAT HE CALLS BIG BUSINESS AND THE SERIES OF PAPERS IN WHICH HE PROVED THAT THESIS TO OUR PEOPLE WILL LONG BE STUDIED AS MODELS OF THE HIGHER JOURNALISMTHE JOURNALISM WHICH IS TO ORDINARY NEWSPAPER WRITING WHAT STATESMANSHIP IS TO POLITICS AS I SAY THERE IS NO NEED OF PROOF BUT SIMPLY BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION AND TO CALL THE PICTURE TO THE READERS MIND LET ME QUOTE A FEW PARAGRAPHS FROM ONE OF THESE PAPERSPITTSBURG A CITY ASHAMED THE RAILROADS BEGAN THE CORRUPTION OF THIS CITY THERE ALWAYS WAS SOME DISHONESTY AS THE OLDEST PUBLIC MEN I TALKED WITH SAID BUT IT WAS OCCASIONAL AND CRIMINAL TILL THE FIRST GREAT CORPORATION MADE IT BUSINESSLIKE AND RESPECTABLE THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD WAS IN THE SYSTEM FROM THE START AND AS THE OTHER ROADS CAME IN AND FOUND THE CITY GOVERNMENT BOUGHT UP BY THOSE BEFORE THEM THEY PURCHASED THEIR RIGHTS OF WAY BY OUTBRIBING THE OLDER ROADS THEN JOINED THE RING TO ACQUIRE MORE RIGHTS FOR THEMSELVES AND TO KEEP BELATED RIVALS OUT AS CORPORATIONS MULTIPLIED AND CAPITAL BRANCHED OUT CORRUPTION INCREASED NATURALLY BUT THE NOTABLE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PITTSBURG PLAN OF MISGOVERNMENT WAS THAT IT WAS NOT A HAPHAZARD GROWTH BUT A DELIBERATE INTELLIGENT ORGANISATION THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD IS A POWER IN PENNSYLVANIA POLITICS IT IS PART OF THE STATE RING AND PART ALSO OF THE PITTSBURG RING THE CITY PAID IN ALL SORTS OF RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES STREETS BRIDGES ETC AND IN CERTAIN PERIODS THE BUSINESS INTERESTS OF THE CITY WERE SACRIFICED TO LEAVE THE PENNSYLVANIA ROAD IN EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF A FREIGHT TRAFFIC IT COULD NOT HANDLE ALONE THE BOSSES WHO RULED PITTSBURG WERE MAGEE AND FLYNN AND MR STEFFENS PRINTS IN FULL THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THEM AND SENATOR QUAY BY WHICH THEY DIVIDED THE BOODLE OF THE STATE MAGEE AND FLYNN WERE THE GOVERNMENT AND THE LAW HOW COULD THEY COMMIT A CRIME IF THEY WANTED SOMETHING FROM THE CITY THEY PASSED AN ORDINANCE GRANTING IT AND IF SOME OTHER ORDINANCE WAS IN CONFLICT IT WAS REPEALED OR AMENDED IF THE LAWS OF THE STATE STOOD IN THE WAY SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THE LAWS OF THE STATE THEY WERE AMENDED IF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE PROVED A BARRIER AS IT DID TO ALL SPECIAL LEGISLATION THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED A LAW FOR CITIES OF THE SECOND CLASS WHICH WAS PITTSBURG ALONE AND THE COURTS UPHELD THE LEGISLATURE IF THERE WERE OPPOSITION ON THE SIDE OF PUBLIC OPINION THERE WAS A USE FOR THAT ALSO AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE UNLAWFUL ACTS WERE EXCEPTIONAL AND UNNECESSARY IN PITTSBURG MAGEE DID NOT STEAL FRANCHISES AND SELL THEM HIS COUNCILS GAVE THEM TO HIM HE AND THE BUSY FLYNN TOOK THEM AND BUILT RAILWAYS WHICH MAGEE SOLD AND BOUGHT AND FINANCED AND CONDUCTED LIKE ANY OTHER MAN WHOSE SUCCESSFUL CAREER IS HELD UP AS AN EXAMPLE FOR YOUNG MEN HIS RAILWAYS COMBINED INTO THE CONSOLIDATED TRACTION COMPANY WERE CAPITALISED AT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THERE WAS SCANDAL IN CHICAGO OVER THE GRANTING OF CHARTERS FOR TWENTYEIGHT AND FIFTY YEARS MAGEES READ FOR NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS FOR NINE HUNDRED AND NINETYNINE YEARS SAID CHARTER IS TO EXIST A THOUSAND YEARS SAID CHARTER IS TO EXIST PERPETUALLY AND THE COUNCILS GAVE FRANCHISES FOR THE LIFE OF THE CHARTER AND ALL THIS WAS A REGULAR PROFESSION A CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY WHICH ITS DEVOTEES STUDIED TWO OF THEM TOLD ME REPEATEDLY THAT THEY TRAVELLED ABOUT THE COUNTRY LOOKING UP THE BUSINESS AND THAT A FELLOWSHIP HAD GROWN UP AMONG BOODLING ALDERMEN OF THE LEADING CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES COMMITTEES FROM CHICAGO WOULD COME TO ST LOUIS TO FIND OUT WHAT NEW GAMES THE ST LOUIS BOODLERS HAD AND THEY GAVE THE ST LOUISANS HINTS AS TO HOW THEY DID THE BUSINESS IN CHICAGO SO THE CHICAGO AND ST LOUIS BOODLERS USED TO VISIT CLEVELAND AND PITTSBURG AND ALL THE OTHER CITIES OR IF THE DISTANCE WAS TOO GREAT THEY GOT THEIR IDEAS BY THOSE MYSTERIOUS CHANNELS WHICH RUN ALL THROUGH THE WORLD OF GRAFT THE MEETING PLACE IN ST LOUIS WAS DECKERS STABLE AND IDEAS UNFOLDED THERE WERE DEVELOPED INTO PLANS WHICH THE BOODLERS SAY TODAY ARE ONLY IN ABEYANCE IN DECKERS STABLE WAS BORN THE PLAN TO SELL THE UNION MARKET AND THOUGH THE DEAL DID NOT GO THROUGH THE BOODLERS WHEN THEY SAW IT FAILING MADE THE MARKETMEN PAY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR KILLING IT THIS SCHEME IS LAID ASIDE FOR THE FUTURE ANOTHER THAT FAILED WAS TO SELL THE COURTHOUSE AND THIS WAS WELL UNDER WAY WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE GROUND ON WHICH THIS PUBLIC BUILDING STANDS WAS GIVEN TO THE CITY ON CONDITION THAT IT WAS TO BE USED FOR A COURTHOUSE AND NOTHING ELSE THE GRANDEST IDEA OF ALL CAME FROM PHILADELPHIA IN THAT CITY THE GASWORKS WERE SOLD OUT TO A PRIVATE CONCERN AND THE WATERWORKS WERE TO BE SOLD NEXT THE ST LOUIS FELLOWS HAVE BEEN TRYING EVER SINCE TO FIND A PURCHASER FOR THEIR WATERWORKS THE PLANT IS WORTH AT LEAST FORTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT THE BOODLERS THOUGHT THEY COULD LET IT GO AT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND GET ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR SO THEMSELVES FOR THE BARGAIN THE SCHEME WAS TO DO IT AND SKIP SAID ONE OF THE BOODLERS WHO TOLD ME ABOUT IT AND IF YOU COULD MIX IT ALL UP WITH SOME FILTERING SCHEME IT COULD BE DONE ONLY SOME OF US THOUGHT WE COULD MAKE MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF ITA FORTUNE APIECE IT WILL BE DONE SOME DAY SUCH THEN IS THE BOODLING SYSTEM AS WE SEE IT IN ST LOUIS EVERYTHING THE CITY OWNED WAS FOR SALE BY THE OFFICERS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE THE PURCHASERS MIGHT BE WILLING OR UNWILLING TAKERS THEY MIGHT BE CITIZENS OR OUTSIDERS IT WAS ALL ONE TO THE CITY GOVERNMENT SO LONG AS THE MEMBERS OF THE COMBINES GOT THE PROCEEDS THEY WOULD SELL OUT THE TOWN WOULD THEY DID AND THEY WILL IF A CITY TREASURER RUNS AWAY WITH FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE IS A GREAT HALLOO ABOUT IT IN ST LOUIS THE REGULARLY ORGANISED THIEVES WHO RULE HAVE SOLD FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FRANCHISES AND OTHER VALUABLE MUNICIPAL ASSETS THIS IS THE ESTIMATE MADE FOR ME BY A BANKER WHO SAID THAT THE BOODLERS GOT NOT ONETENTH OF THE VALUE OF THE THINGS THEY SOLD TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO BEFORE I MET MR STEFFENS I THOUGHT THAT HE KNEW ONLY AS MUCH AS HE LET ON AND SO I WROTE HIM AN OPEN LETTER TO POINT OUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS RGIME OF BIG BUSINESS THE STORY OF THIS MANUSCRIPT IS AN AMUSING ONE AND WORTH TELLING FOR THE LIGHT IT THROWS UPON MY ARGUMENT MR STEFFENS WAS SO GOOD AS TO SAY THAT IT WAS THE BEST CRITICISM OF HIMSELF THAT HE HAD EVER READ AND IT WAS SCHEDULED FOR PUBLICATION IN ONE OF OUR THREE OR FOUR LARGEST MAGAZINES BUT ALASIT WAS PURCHASED BY THE ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNG EDITOR AND THEN READ BY THE ELDERLY AND UNENTHUSIASTIC PROPRIETOR WHEN I REBELLED AT THE LONG WAIT WHICH FOLLOWED THE PROPRIETOR INVITED ME TO DINNER AND UNBOSOMED HIS SOUL TO ME HE WAS THE DEAREST OLD GENTLEMAN I EVER MET AND HE PUT HIS ARM ABOUT ME WHILE HE EXPLAINED THE SITUATION MY BOY HE SAID YOU ARE A VERY CLEVER CHAP AND YOU KNOW A LOT BUT WHY DONT YOU PUT IT ALL INTO A BOOK WHERE YOU CANT HURT ANYONE BUT YOURSELF WHY DO YOU TRY TO GET IT INTO MY MAGAZINE AND SCARE AWAY MY HALF MILLION SUBSCRIBERS SO THE LETTER WAS SHELVED BUT THE QUESTIONS IT ASKED ARE NOW THE QUESTIONS WHICH EVENTS ARE ASKING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND SO I SHALL TAKE THE ADVICE OF THE ELDERLY AND UNENTHUSIASTIC PROPRIETORAND PUBLISH SOME OF THE LETTER IN A BOOK IT RAN AS FOLLOWS THIS IS THE QUESTION I HAVE WISHED TO ASK YOU MR STEFFENS A REVOLUTION HAS HAPPENED YOU TELL US WE HAVE NO LONGER A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLEWE HAVE A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE RASCALS FOR THE RICH AND IF WE FIND THAT THAT REVOLUTION WHICH HAS OVERTHROWN THE LAW AND WHICH DEFIES THE LAW CANNOT BE PUT DOWN AND OVERCOME BY THE MEANS OF THE LAWWHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO THEN ARE WE GOING TO SIT STILL AND CONTENT OURSELVES WITH SAYING IT IS TOO BAD ARE WE GOING TO BEAR ITTO BEAR IT FOREVER CAN WE BEAR IT FOREVER AND IF WE CANNOT BEAR IT FOREVER WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WHEN WE CAN BEAR IT NO LONGER A REVOLUTION IS A SERIOUS THING MR STEFFENS A MAN SHOULD NOT TALK ABOUT A REVOLUTION EXCEPT WITH A THOROUGH REALISATION OF WHAT THE WORD IMPLIES A REVOLUTION MEANS THAT THE SOCIAL CONTRACT HAS BEEN BROKEN THAT RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED AND JUSTICE DEFIEDTHAT IN A WORD THE GAME OF LIFE HAS NOT BEEN FAIRLY PLAYED THAT THOSE WHO HAVE LOST MAY POSSIBLY HAVE HAD THE RIGHT TO WIN AND THE GAME OF LIFE IS A PRETTY STERN GAME FOR MANY OF US MR STEFFENS YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS I AND MY FRIENDS BELONG TO A CLASS WHOM THIS SYSTEM TOUCHES ONLY THROUGH OUR IDEALS EDITORS AND AUTHORS CLERGYMEN AND LAWYERS WE ARE PAINED TO KNOW THAT CORRUPTION IS EATING OUT THE HEART OF OUR COUNTRYBUT STILL IF THE PROBLEM BE NOT SOLVED TODAY WE CAN PUT IT OFF TILL TOMORROW AND NOT REALISE WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES BUT THERE ARE SOME IN OUR COUNTRY WHOM THE SYSTEM TOUCHES FAR MORE INTIMATELY AND DIRECTLY THAN THISSOME TO WHOM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TODAY AND TOMORROW IS SIMPLY A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH I HAPPENED ONLY YESTERDAY TO BE READING A LETTER FROM A MAN WHO I THINK KNOWS THAT SYSTEM WHICH IS OUR NEW GOVERNMENT IN THIS PERSONAL AND INTIMATE WAY I WILL QUOTE A FEW WORDS FROM HIS LETTER I HAVE BEEN ARRESTED PUT IN JAIL PROSECUTED AND PERSECUTED I HAVE HAD MY CUSTOMERS DRIVEN AWAY I HAVE BEEN BOYCOTTED TO THE EXTENT THAT MEN WHO DARED TO TRADE WITH ME HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS I HAVE HAD MY HOME BROKEN INTO AT NIGHT BEEN BEATEN WITH GUNS AND ABUSED BY VILE AND FOULMOUTHED THUGS BEEN TORN PARTLY DRESSED AND BLEEDING FROM THE SIDE OF MY WIFE WHO WAS DRIVEN FROM HER BEDROOM AND ROUGHLY HANDLED AND FINALLY I HAVE BEEN SHIPPED OUT AND TOLD THAT IF I RETURNED TO MY HOME I WOULD BE HUNG NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS THEY HAVE TWICE DEPORTED MY BROTHER WHO WAS CONDUCTING THE BUSINESS IN WHICH WE WERE BOTH EARNING OUR LIVING SO THAT IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR AN ADJUSTER TO TAKE CHARGE OF OUR STORE ALL THIS WAS NEEDLESS TO SAY IN COLORADO THE WRITER IS MR A H FLOATEN A STOREKEEPER OF TELLURIDE BUT NOW OF RICHMOND COUNTY WISCONSIN WHERE HE WAS WORKING IN A HAYFIELD WHEN HE WROTE HE GOES ON TO ADD THAT THE CHARGE UPON WHICH HE WAS DEPORTED WAS THAT OF SELLING GOODS TO MEMBERS OF THE WESTERN FEDERATION OF MINERS AS FOR MY BROTHER AND MYSELF HE STATES I DEFY ANY AND ALL PERSONS TO SHOW A SINGLE INSTANCE WHERE EITHER OF US HAVE EVER VIOLATED ANY LAW OR EVEN BEEN SUSPECTED OF CRIME OR HAVE EVER WRONGED ANY PERSON HERE IS YOUR REVOLUTION MR STEFFENS IN FULL SWING ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WHICH I HAVE FOR SOME MONTHS FOUND MYSELF LONGING TO ASK YOU IS HOW CLEARLY YOU RECOGNISED IN THE COLORADO CIVIL WAR THE NATURAL AND INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF A CONTINUATION OF YOUR GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE RASCALS FOR THE RICH HERE IS AN UNEQUIVOCAL DECLARATION BY A VOTE OF TWO TO ONE BY THE PEOPLE IN ONE OF THE STATES OF THIS FREE COUNTRY IN FAVOUR OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PERMITTING AN EIGHTHOUR LAW AND HERE ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF BOTH THE MAJORITY PARTIES PLEDGING THEMSELVES TO ENACT IT AND THEN OPENLY AND SHAMELESSLY SELLING THEMSELVES OUT TO THE PREDATORY CORPORATIONS OF THE STATE THE PEOPLE THEN RESORT TO A STRIKE TO SECURE THEIR RIGHTS AND WHEN THEY ARE SEEN TO BE WINNING THE MILITIA IS SUMMONED CRIMINALS ARE HIRED TO COMMIT A DYNAMITE OUTRAGE AND AFFORD THE NECESSARY PRETEXT AND THEN EVERY TRADITION OF AMERICAN LIBERTY AND EVERY SAFEGUARD OF FREE INSTITUTIONS IS OVERTHROWN AND THE STRIKE CRUSHED AND THE STRIKERS ORGANISATION EXTERMINATED WITH A RUTHLESSNESS AND A RECKLESSNESS WHICH NO POLICE OFFICIAL IN RUSSIA COULD HAVE SURPASSED AND THEN THE PARTY OF LAW AND ORDERTHAT IS THE SYSTEMSAT ENTHRONED IN COLORADO AND THE GUILELESS READER OF NEWSPAPER DESPATCHES BELIEVED THAT AN ELECTION TOOK PLACE IN THAT STATE LAST NOVEMBER THE SYSTEM SUSPENDED THE HABEAS CORPUS ACT CENSORED NEWSPAPERS AND TELEGRAMS OPENED MAILS ENTERED HOUSES WITHOUT WARRANT AND DROVE WOMEN FROM THEIR BEDS AT DEAD OF NIGHT DEPORTED MEN DEFIED AND THREATENED JUDGES SHUT DOWN MINES IN SPITE OF THEIR OWNERS WILLAND FINALLY HALED A SCORE OR TWO OF ELECTED OFFICIALS BEFORE IT AND PUT ROPES AROUND THEIR NECKS AND COMPELLED THEM TO RESIGN AND THEN THE REBELLION THAT IS THE AGITATION FOR AN EIGHTHOUR LAW ATTEMPTED TO REASSERT ITSELF IN THE FORM OF BALLOTS AND BY MEANS OF A THREAT OF DEPOSITION IT COMPELLED THE NEWLY ELECTED GOVERNOR TO ACCEDE IN EVERYTHING TO ITS WILLAND IN PARTICULAR TO RETAIN IN OFFICE THE INFAMOUS MILITIA OFFICIAL WHO WAS ITS AGENT IN THESE CRIMES BUT WE AS I SAID BEFORE ARE TOUCHED BY THESE THINGS ONLY THROUGH OUR IDEALS WE ARE SORRY TO SEE AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS OVERTHROWN IN AN AMERICAN STATE BUT WE DO NOT LIVE IN COLORADO AND WE ARE QUITE SURE THAT THERE IS NO DANGER OF OUR BEING TURNED OUT OF OUR HOMES AND YET WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM EXISTS IN OUR OWN CITY AND STATE AND SITS JUST AS SURELY INTRENCHED THERE AS IN COLORADO AND WE KNOW ALSO THAT IT EXISTS FOR A PURPOSETHAT IT EXISTS TO RULE AND ARE WE TO IMAGINE THAT IT EXISTS TO RULE THE PEOPLE OF PATAGONIA OF GREENLAND AND AFGHANISTAN DO WE NOT KNOW THAT IT EXISTS TO RULE US HOW DOES IT RULE US HOW DOES IT RULE THE PEOPLE OF COLORADO WHATEVER IS IT THAT IS WANTED OF THE PEOPLE OF COLORADO WHY SIMPLY THAT THEY SHOULD GO INTO THE MINES AND FACTORIES AND WORK NOT EIGHT HOURS A DAY AS THEY WISHED TO BUT TWELVE HOURS A DAY THE TIME THE SYSTEM BADE THEM TO AND WHAT IS IT THAT IT WANTS EVERYWHERE ELSEIN CALIFORNIA IN MAINE AND IN TEXAS WHAT SAVE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE LABOUR TO SELL SHALL SELL IT AT THE PRICE THE SYSTEM IS PAYING AND THAT THOSE WHO HAVE GOODS TO BUY SHALL BUY THEM AT THE PRICE THE SYSTEM ASKS IF THIS BE SO IS NOT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND THE PEOPLE OF COLORADO THAT THEY WENT ON STRIKE AGAINST THE SYSTEM WHEREAS WE ARE NOT ON STRIKEWE PAY LET US DEAL WITH FACTS HERE IS A CORPORATION WHICH RUNS A STREETRAILROAD IN A CITY IT GIVES AN ABOMINABLE SERVICE ITS CARS ARE COLD AND FILTHY ITS EMPLOYEES ARE UNDERPAID WRETCHES WHO WORK THIRTEEN AND FIFTEEN HOURS A DAYAND THE FARE IS JUST DOUBLE THAT OF THE SPLENDID GOVERNMENT SERVICE OF BERLIN AND THE PUBLICSPIRITED MEN OF THE CITY HAVE FOR TEN OR TWENTY YEARS BEEN TRYING TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT CORPORATION AT THE STATE CAPITAL BUT THE CORPORATION HAS ITS LOBBY AND CONTINUES TO PAY PIG DIVIDENDS UPON ITS WATERED STOCK YEAR AFTER YEAR AND THEN DO THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY ORGANISE AND GO ON STRIKE AGAINST THAT CORPORATION NO INDEEDTHEY PAY YOU KNOW OF THE AGITATION FOR A PARCELS POST YOU KNOW THAT UNDER THE PARCELSPOST SYSTEM AN ENGLISHMAN CAN SEND A PACKAGE TO CALIFORNIA FOR ONETHIRD OF WHAT IT COSTS US TO SEND ONE FROM NEW YORK IN GERMANY A TENPOUND PACKAGE MAY BE SENT ANYWHERE IN THE EMPIRE FOR TWELVE CENTS AND OUR POST OFFICE PAYS THE RAILROADS MORE FOR ITS SERVICE THAN ALL THE REST OF THE CIVILISED WORLD COMBINED THOUGH THE QUANTITY OF MAIL MATTER CARRIED IS LESS THAN THAT OF GREAT BRITAIN FRANCE AND GERMANY ALONE YET WE KNOW THAT IT IS A WASTE OF INK SETTING THESE FACTS FORTH IS NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES EXPRESS COMPANY THE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM YOUR OWN STATE THE RAILROAD SYSTEMS OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE OF COURSE THEIR LOBBY IN EVERY STATE CAPITAL AND IN WASHINGTON AS WELL AND EVERY SINGLE YEAR THE RAILROAD SYSTEMS OF THIS COUNTRY SLAUGHTER AND MAIM THE EQUIVALENT OF A GETTYSBURG CAMPAIGNTHERE WERE AS MANY PEOPLE KILLED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS AS THE BRITISH LOST IN THE ENTIRE BOER WAR YET THERE IS NOT THE LEAST REASON FOR THIS THE RAILROADS COULD IF THEY CHOSE BUILD CARS WHICH WILL NOT CRUMBLE UP LIKE MATCHBOXESTHEY HAVE PROVEN IT BY KILLING ONLY SIX PULLMANCAR PASSENGERS IN THE SAME THREE YEARS BUT OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO PAY A LARGE SUM EXTRA TO RIDE IN A PULLMAN CAR IF YOU CANNOT PAY WITH MONEY YOU PAY WITH YOUR BONESIN EITHER CASE OF COURSE YOU PAY AND THEN THERE IS THE TARIFF YOU MR STEFFENS ARE A MAN WHO HAS BOTH THE ABILITY AND THE HONESTY TO THINK AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE TARIFF IS YOU KNOW THAT IT IS A DEVICE TO KEEP OUT FOREIGN COMPETITION AND THUS ENABLE HOME MANUFACTURERS TO CHARGE HIGHER PRICES YOU KNOW THAT IN THE EARLY DAYS ITS EFFECT WAS TO MAKE MANUFACTURING POSSIBLE BY KEEPING PRICES AT A LEVEL WHERE A FAIR PROFIT WAS PAID ABOVE THIS LEVEL THEY COULD NOT GO BECAUSE THERE WAS FREE DOMESTIC COMPETITION THE TARIFF WAS THUS A TAX SELFIMPOSED BY EVERY MAN IN THE COUNTRY FOR THE PURPOSE OF BUILDING UP THE COUNTRYS HOME INDUSTRIES EXACTLY AS IF THE OWNER OF A SUGARPLANTATION SHOULD CONCLUDE IT WOULD PAY HIM TO GRIND HIS OWN CANE AND SHOULD SET ASIDE HIS GAINS FOR A FEW YEARS TO BUY THE MACHINERY NOW I MIGHT STOP TO ARGUE THE SOCIALISTIC IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH A PROCEDUREINVOLVING AS IT DOES THE DOCTRINE THAT THE MANUFACTURES ARE THE INTEREST AND CONCERN OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE TO THE ADVANTAGES OF WHICH WHEN COMPLETED THEY ALL HAVE A RIGHT NO PLANTATION MASTER I TAKE IT WOULD EXPECT TO FURNISH HIMSELF WITH MACHINERY OUT OF THE WAGES OF HIS HANDS CONTINUING HOWEVER TO DISCUSS FACTS AND NOT THEORIES YOU SEE THAT THESE INDUSTRIES WHICH WE HAVE ENCOURAGED HAVE NOW BECOME THE MIGHTIEST POWER IN THE LAND IT IS THEY WHO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THE REVOLUTION AND SET UP THE SYSTEM IT IS THEY WHO USE THE MONEY WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE TURNED OVER TO THEM TO MAINTAIN AND PERPETUATE THE OLD ARRANGEMENTAN ARRANGEMENT WHICH NOW ENABLES THEM SINCE THEY HAVE BECOME MONOPOLIES TO CHARGE FOR THEIR PRODUCTS FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY PER CENT MORE THAN A FAIR PRICE AS IS PROVEN BY WHAT THEY CHARGE ABROAD THE WORKINGMAN YOU KNOW MR STEFFENS HAS ALL THIS JUSTIFIED TO HIM BY THE FACT THAT HE GETS HIS SHARE OF THIS PROSPERITY BUT OF LATE THE WORKINGMAN HAS BEEN FINDING THAT HE DOES NOT GET HIS SHARE HE HAS BROUGHT THE INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY OF THE COUNTRY TO SUCH A PITCH OF PERFECTION THAT HE PRODUCES MORE THAN THE COUNTRY NEEDS AND SO WHEN FOREIGN MARKETS FAIL HE IS OUT OF WORK PART OF THE TIME AND THE MASS OF UNEMPLOYED LABOUR OPERATES BY THE IRON LAW TO BEAT DOWN WAGES AND TO BREAK STRIKES AND TO MAKE HIS SHARE LESS AND LESS AND ALL THE TIME TO PAY INTEREST ON THE CONSTANTLY INCREASING CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY THE PRICES OF TRUST PRODUCTS ARE BEING RAISED YET HIGHER AND THE COST OF LIVING IS RISING YEAR BY YEAR IN THE COTTON MILLS OF ALABAMA AND GEORGIA LITTLE CHILDREN SIX AND EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ARE WORKING TWELVE HOURS FOR A WAGE OF NINE CENTS A DAY AND HOW DO YOU THINK THEY FARE IN THIS FEARFUL RACE FOR PROFITSWHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE EFFECT UPON THEM OF THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT I SAID A LITTLE WAY BACK THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY TO WHOM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TODAY AND TOMORROW IS SIMPLY A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH IT WAS SUCH PEOPLE AS THESE I HAD IN MIND LOOK MR STEFFENS YOU GO FROM TOWN TO CITY AND FROM CITY TO STATE AND EVERYWHERE YOU SHOW US HORDES OF POLITICAL PARASITES BATTENING ON CORRUPTION AND YOU TELL US THAT THE FORTUNES THAT THEY MAKE REPRESENT BUT A SMALL PORTION OF WHAT IS MADE BY THE BIG BUSINESS MEN WHO BRIBE THEM MAGEE AND QUAY YOU TELL US MADE THIRTY MILLIONS OUT OF THE STREET RAILROADS OF PITTSBURG AND ALL OVER THIS LAND YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT SUCH SUMS ARE BEING MADE AND SOON AFTERWARD CAME MR LAWSONS STORY OF HOW THE STANDARD OIL GROUP MADE FORTYSIX MILLION DOLLARS IN A SINGLE DEAL WITHOUT TURNING OVER THEIR HANDS MR LAWSON EXPATIATES UPON THIS WAY OF MAKING DOLLARSHE MAKES REFLECTIONS WHICH I HAD OFTEN WONDERED IF YOU WERE MAKING I HAVE WONDERED IF YOU REALISED ENTIRELY THAT THESE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE REAL DOLLARS DOLLARS THAT A MAN MIGHT SPEND JUST THE SAME AS ANY OTHER DOLLARSWITH WHICH HE MIGHT PURCHASE FOOD THAT MEN HAD TOILED TO RAISE AND HOUSES THAT MEN HAD TOILED TO BUILD I AM WRITING THESE WORDS IN OCTOBER AND THE WINDOWS OF MY ROOM LOOK OUT UPON A CORNFIELD ALL THE YEAR LONG I HAVE WATCHED A FARMER AND HIS SON AT WORK IN THIS FIELDFIRST PLOWING IT THEN HARROWING IT BACK AND FORTH AND ACROSS THEN PLANTING THE CORN PATIENTLY ROW BY ROW THE FIELD IS TEN ACRES IN SIZE AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NOT A WEEK PASSED ALL SUMMER THAT THE FARMER WAS NOT PLOWING AND WEEDING IT AND NOW THAT THE FALL HAS COME HE HAS CUT IT STALK BY STALK AND STACKED IT AND NOW I CAN SEE HIM AND HIS SON SITTING ON THE BARE BLEAK HILLSIDE THIS MORNING HUSKING IT EAR BY EAR THAT WILL TAKE THEM ALL OF TWO OR THREE WEEKS AND WHEN THE WHOLE THING HAS BEEN DONE THEY WILL GATHER UP THE EARS TO CART THEM TO TOWN AND THE FARMER WILL HAVE FIVE HUNDRED BUSHELS OF CORN AND WILL GET FOR THEM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AND THEN I READ MR LAWSONS ACCOUNT OF HOW THE ROCKEFELLERS MADE FORTYSIX MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF AMALGAMATED COPPERAND STRIVE TO REALISE THAT WHAT THEY MADE WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE LABOUR OF THE FARMER AND THE FARMERS SONS AND THE FARMERS HORSES IN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTYSIX THOUSAND TENACRE CORNFIELDS SUCH AS THE ONE I LOOK OUT UPON IS IT NOT OBVIOUS THAT IF I WERE TO HAVE THE POWER TO CALL A PIECE OF PAPER ONE DOLLAR AND TO PUT IT INTO CIRCULATION EXCHANGING IT FOR TWO BUSHELS OF CORN I COULD ONLY DO IT BY DIMINISHING THE VALUE OF EVERY OTHER DOLLAR IN THE COUNTRY A CERTAIN SMALL AMOUNT SUPPOSING THAT THE TOTAL WEALTH OF THE COUNTRY WAS ONE BILLION DOLLARS I SHOULD DIMINISH EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR BY ONEBILLIONTH SUPPOSE THAT SIMILARLY I MADE ONE MILLION DOLLARSBY ANY SORT OF MAKING WHATEVER SAVE BY PRODUCING SOME USEFUL THING AND INCREASING THE TOTAL WEALTH OF THE COUNTRYI SHOULD THEN TAX THE HOLDER OF EVERY DOLLAR ONE MILL A MAN WHO OWNED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE ROBBED BY ME OF TEN DOLLARSHE WOULD BE ROBBED OF IT JUST AS LITERALLY AND AS ACTUALLY AS IF I HAD BROKEN INTO HIS HOUSE AND STOLEN HIS WATCH HE WOULD NOT KNOW THAT HE WAS ROBBED PERHAPSALL THAT HE WOULD KNOW WOULD BE THAT WHEN HE SPENT HIS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS HE WOULD NOT GET QUITE SO MUCH IN DUNS AND BRADSTREETS THE EVENT WOULD BE RECORDED IN THE STATEMENT THAT THE COST OF LIVING HAD RISEN ONETENTH OF ONE PER CENT SINCE LAST WEEK AND THAT INTEREST RATES HAD SIMILARLY DECLINED AND NOW HERE IS THE YOUNG GIRL WHO WORKS IN THE SWEATSHOPS OF CHICAGO FOR A WAGE OF FORTY CENTS A WEEK AS THOUSANDS OF THEM DO THE GREAT AMALGAMATED COPPER DEAL IS CONSUMMATED MR ROCKEFELLER AND HIS FELLOWCONSPIRATORS MAKE FORTYSIX MILLION DOLLARSAND THE YOUNG GIRLS WAGE BECOMES THIRTYNINE CENTS AND A FRACTION AT FORTY CENTS SHE WAS HANGING ON FOR HER LIFE AT THIRTYNINE CENTS AND A FRACTION SHE ENTERS THE NEAREST BROTHEL HERE IS THE LITTLE CHILD OF EIGHT YEARS TOILING FROM SIX AT NIGHT TILL SIX IN THE MORNING IN THE MIDST OF THROBBING COTTONLOOMS FOR NINE CENTS MAGEE AND QUAY OF PITTSBURG MAKE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN STREET RAILROADSAND THE LITTLE CHILDS WAGE BECOMES EIGHT CENTS AND A FRACTION AT NINE CENTS HE WAS STARVING AT EIGHT AND A FRACTION HE FAINTS AND THE MACHINERY SEIZES HIM AND HIS ARM HAS BEEN TORN OUT OF HIM BEFORE ANYONE CAN ANSWER HIS SCREAMS SO IT IS MR STEFFENS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY TO WHOM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TODAY AND TOMORROW IS SIMPLY A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH THAT FARMER ABOUT WHOSE WORK I SPOKE WILL TAKE HIS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS TO THE BANK FOR DEPOSIT AND IN THE LINE BEFORE THE WINDOW WILL BE A YOUNG SPENDTHRIFT IDLER WITH A MONTHS INCOME FROM HIS FATHERS ESTATE AND A POLITICIAN WITH A BRIBE FOR A STREET RAILWAY FRANCHISE AND TO THE BANKER ALL THESE DEPOSITS WILL STAND UPON EQUAL TERMS THEY WILL ALL BE EQUALLY GOOD AND WILL CLAIM AND GET INTEREST AT THE SAME RATE THE FARMER WILL HAVE TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH A LOWER RATE BECAUSE OF THE COMPETITION OF THE OTHERS AND NEXT WEEK WHEN THE ACTIVITIES OF SOME SPECULATOR IN WALL STREET BRING ABOUT A FAILURE OF THE BANK HE WILL GET NOT A BIT MORE OUT OF THE WRECK THAN THE OTHER TWO AND THEN HE WILL GO BACK AND TOIL FOR ANOTHER YEAR TO RAISE A SIMILAR CROPAND WHAT WILL HE FIND THEN WHY THIS THE FORTYSIX MILLIONS OF THE STANDARD OIL GANG WILL HAVE SURVIVED ALL MISCHANCES AND HAVING BY THEIR ENORMOUS MASS ATTRACTED PROFITS WILL HAVE BECOME FIFTY MILLIONS OR EVEN SIXTY AND THE THIRTY MILLIONS OF MAGEE AND QUAY WILL HAVE BECOME THIRTYFIVE ALL THE UNTOLD MILLIONS OF THE CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE INCREASED SIMILARLY AND THE INVESTMENT FIELD WILL HAVE BECOME MORE CROWDED YET AND THE PRIZES FEWER YET AND THE CHANCES MORE HAZARDOUS YET AND THE COST OF LIVING WILL BE A LITTLE HIGHER YET AND THE INTEREST RATE A LITTLE LOWER YET AND WAGES A LITTLE LOWER YET AND THE WHOLE OF HUMAN SOCIETY WILL BE TOILING A LITTLE HARDER YET TO PAY THE PROFITS UPON THAT HEAPEDUP MASS OF WEALTH MORE MEN WILL BE TAKING TO DRINK AND MORE WOMEN WILL BE TAKING TO BROTHELSMORE TO SUICIDE MADNESS VAGABONDAGE AND CRIME THE RACE FOR PROFITS WILL BE A LITTLE MORE FIERCE SOCIAL OSTENTATION WILL BE A LITTLE MORE VULGAR POLITICAL CORRUPTION WILL BE A LITTLE MORE SHAMELESS STRIKES AND RIOTS WILL BE A LITTLE MORE COMMON THE SOCIALISTS WILL BE A LITTLE MORE ACTIVEAND YOU MR LINCOLN STEFFENS WILL BE A LITTLE MORE SADDENED AT THE SIGHT OF YOUR COUNTRYS DOWNWARD CAREER I HAVE NOTICED THE VERY CURIOUS FACT ABOUT YOUR VIEWS THAT ALL YOUR HOPE OF BETTERMENT IS IN THE FUTUREIT IS ALWAYS HOW WE CAN PREVENT NEW STEALING NEVER HOW WE CAN PUNISH THE PAST AND SO THOSE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OF MAGEE AND QUAY THE FORTYSIX MILLIONS OF THE AMALGAMATED DEALTHEY ARE SAFE AND BEYOND RECALL FOREVER MR LAWSON TALKS ABOUT RESTITUTION DO YOU THINK HE WILL EVER BRING IT ABOUTDO YOU SEE ANY SIGNS OF IT SO FAR AND YET THOSE FORTYSIX MILLION DOLLARS ASSUMING THAT THEY GROW AT TEN PER CENT A SMALL EARNING FOR SUCH A SUMYEAR AFTER YEAR THEY WILL BE ROUGHLY SPEAKING AS FOLLOWS AND SO ON IN OTHER WORDS THE HEIRS OF THE AMALGAMATED FINANCIERS WILL TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW HAVE MULTIPLIED THAT SUM NEARLY SEVEN TIMES AND BE RECEIVING NEARLY SEVEN TIMES AS MUCH TRIBUTE FROM THE SEWINGGIRL IN THE CHICAGO SLUMS AND THE CHILDREN IN THE GEORGIA COTTON MILL I MR STEFFENS AM ONE OF THOSE WHO LOOK UPON ALL PROFITS RENT INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS AS A SURVIVAL OF BARBARISM THE LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST OF THE DEVICES WHEREBY THE STRONG ENSLAVE THE WEAK AND PROFIT BY THEIR TOIL BUT I ASSUME THAT YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THESETHAT YOU ARE ONE OF THE CLASS I HEARD DESCRIBED BY A SPEAKER THE OTHER NIGHT WHO THINK THAT THE FIRST DOLLAR IS A MALE DOLLAR AND THE SECOND A FEMALE AND THAT WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN THE BANK TOGETHER THEY BRING FORTH DIMES AND NICKELS WHICH IN THE COURSE OF THE YEARS GROW UP TO BE DOLLARS AS BIG AS THEIR PARENTS YET EVEN SO YOU CAN NOT BUT RECOGNISE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LEGITIMATE AND ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN YOU CAN NOTTO DROP AN INCONVENIENT METAPHORCLAIM THAT SOCIETY CAN BY ANY POSSIBILITY WHATEVER BE REQUIRED TO GO ON PAYING TRIBUTE TO THAT STOLEN FORTYSIX MILLIONSTHE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLIONS OF TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW IT IS A MAXIM OF LAW MR STEFFENS THAT THERE IS NO WRONG WITHOUT ITS REDRESS AND IF YOU GRANT THIS AND BEGIN TO EXAMINE THE MILLIONS IN THAT LIGHTWHAT PERPLEXITIES YOU COME UPON ONLY TAKE THE TARIFF FOR INSTANCEIS THERE A DOLLAR INVESTED IN THE BUSINESS OF THIS COUNTRY TODAY WHICH HAS NOT PROFITED BY THAT AND WHICH IS THEREFORE NOT MADE UP OUT OF THE TINY CONTRIBUTIONS OF THOUSANDS OF PERSONS WHO NOT ONLY DO NOT OWN THAT DOLLAR BUT DO NOT OWN ANY OTHER DOLLAR AND THEN CONSIDER THAT THE BEGINNINGS OF MOST OF OUR GREAT FORTUNES WERE MADE IN CIVIL WAR TIMES WHEN THE NATION IN ITS EXTREMITY PAID TWO DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR IN VALUE IT RECEIVED AND CONSIDER THE CHAOS OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION THAT FOLLOWED THE TWENTY YEARS OF PLUNDERING OF EVERY VARIETY THAT AMERICAN INGENUITY COULD INVENT FROM BLACK FRIDAY TO THE WESTERN LAND GRABS AND RAILROAD STEALS TRY TO FIGURE HOW MANY CRIMES ARE REPRESENTED BY THE VANDERBILT MILLIONS HOW MANY BY THE GOULDSS THINK OF THE COMMERCIAL ASSASSINATIONS REPRESENTED BY THE WORD STANDARD OILTHE SECRET REBATES AND DISCRIMINATIONS THE WHOLESALE BUYINGS OF LEGISLATURES AND ELECTIONS THINK OF THE WHOLE INSTITUTION OF CORRUPTION OF THE PRESENT DAY OF THE SYSTEM INTRENCHED IN VILLAGE AND TOWN CITY AND STATE AND NATION OWNING BOTH PARTIES THE EXECUTIVE THE LEGISLATIVE AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT THE SCHOOLS THE COLLEGES THE PULPITS THE PRESS LITERATURE AND ART AND PUBLIC OPINIONMAKING IT NOT FIGURATIVELY AND HYPERBOLICALLY BUT LITERALLY SIMPLY AND INDISPUTABLY THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOT TODAY IN THE LAND A PLACE WHERE A MAN CAN TAKE A DOLLAR AND INVEST IT AND GET BACK A COPPER CENT THAT IS NOT TAINTED WITH CORRUPTION POLLUTED BY VIOLENCE TREASON AND CRIME AND STAINED WITH THE BLOOD AND TEARS OF UNCOUNTED THOUSANDS OF AGONISED WOMEN AND CHILDREN SO MUCH FOR THE LETTER IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO AFTER READING IT IS STILL OF THE OPINION THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD PAY THE TRIBUTE DEMANDED TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW THERE IS NOTHING MORE THAT I CAN SAY TO HIMEXCEPT TO GIVE A FEW STATISTICS BY WAY OF FURTHER ELUCIDATION SHOWING HIM HOW MANY MORE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THERE WILL BE TO ENTER THEIR CLAIM THERE WILL BE FOR INSTANCE THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THE ASTOR FAMILYALL INVESTED IN NEW YORK CITY REAL ESTATE AND AT THE RATE OF GROWTH OF THE CITY CERTAINLY DESTINED TO BE A BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY YEARS FROM DATE THERE IS THE HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF MR ROCKEFELLER INCREASING BY A MOST CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE AT THE RATE OF TEN PER CENT PER YEAR AND THEREFORE DESTINED TO BE OVER FOUR BILLIONS AT THAT TIME AND THEN THERE ARE THE RAILROADS OF THE COUNTRY WE ARE NOW BEING PREPARED FOR A DECISION TO BE SOME DAY DELIVERED BY THE SUPREME COURT TO THE EFFECT THAT ANY RATE REGULATION WHICH INTERFERES WITH DIVIDENDS IS CONFISCATION AND THEREFORE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND YET WE KNOW THAT RAILROAD CAPITALISATION IS SIMPLY A FUNCTION OF EARNINGPOWER THAT WHAT THE FINANCIERS HAVE UNIFORMLY DONE WAS TO CHARGE ALL THE TRAFFIC WOULD BEAR AND THEN WATER THEIR STOCK UNTIL THE RATE OF DIVIDENDS CAME DOWN TO THE MARKET AVERAGE THE CAPITALISATION OF THE RAILROADS OF THE COUNTRY FIXED UPON THIS BASIS IS THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WHEREAS THEIR ACTUAL COST WAS ONLY SIX OR SEVEN BILLIONS TO GIVE ONE OR TWO SAMPLES OF THIS PROCESS THE WESTERN MARYLAND RAILROAD WAS BOUGHT UP BY THE GOULDS AND WATERED FROM NINE MILLIONS UP TO FIFTYONE MILLIONS THE CENTRAL RAILROAD OF GEORGIA WHICH COST LESS THAN SEVEN MILLIONS HAS NOW BEEN WATERED UP TO FIFTYFIVE MILLIONS ASSUMING THAT THE WATERING WERE TO STOP TODAY AND THAT THE RAILROADS SIMPLY REINVESTED THEIR DIVIDENDS AT THE PRESENT RATE OF SIX PER CENT IN TWENTY YEARS WE SHOULD BE PAYING INTEREST UPON OVER FORTY BILLION DOLLARS FROM A BROKERAGE CIRCULAR WHICH RECENTLY CAME IN MY MAIL I HAVE CLIPPED A FEW MORE INSTANCES OF THE WORKINGS OF TRUST FINANCE THE ARGUMENT OF THE CIRCULAR IS THAT I NEED NOT BE FRIGHTENED AT THEIR OFFER TO MAKE MY MONEY EARN MORE THAN SIX PER CENTTHAT OVER A HUNDRED PER CENT IS BEING FREQUENTLY EARNED BY LEGITIMATE BUSINESS THUS THE DIAMOND MATCH COMPANY RECENTLY PAID TEN PER CENT ON A CAPITALISATION OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WHEN ITS ORIGINAL CAPITALISATION HAD BEEN ONLY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY BEGAN IN WITH ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTYFIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS YET IN IT PAID ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN PER CENT ON SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ANYONE WHO HAD INVESTED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THIS STOCK IN WOULD BY HAVE RECEIVED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STOCK DIVIDENDS AND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASH DIVIDENDS THE PRESENT CAPITAL IS OVER NINETYSEVEN MILLIONSAND THE GREATER PART OF THE EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN CREATED OUT OF THE EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY IN THE CASE OF THE PRUDENTIAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OWING THOUGH THE CIRCULAR DOES NOT STATE IT TO A LITTLE DEAL BETWEEN UNITED STATES SENATOR DRYDEN AND THE NEW JERSEY STATE LEGISLATURE FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ORIGINALLY PAID IN THE STOCKHOLDERS NOW OWN TWENTYTWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF STOCK AND RECEIVED ANNUAL CASH DIVIDENDS OF TWENTYTWO HUNDRED DOLLARS OR TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY PER CENT UPON THEIR ORIGINAL INVESTMENT AND THEN TO DIVERSIFY THE SUBJECT LET US CONSIDER THE TARIFF AND ITS VARIEGATED PLUNDERINGS IN A LETTER TO THE NEW YORK EVENING POST OF OCT TH MR J R DUNLAP GAVE SOME FIGURES SHOWING THE SCANDALOUS TAXES IMPOSED BY TRUSTS UPON THE PEOPLE NOW TO SHOW HOW THE DINGLEY DUTY OF EIGHT DOLLARS PER TON ON STEEL RAILS TAXES AMERICAN RAILROADS AND HENCE REACHES DEEP INTO THE POCKETS OF SHIPPERS AND TRAVELLERS ON AMERICAN RAILROADS I NEED ONLY CITE THE FACT THAT DURING THE YEAR OUR AMERICAN RAILROADS PURCHASED FROM THE STEEL POOL EXACTLY THREE MILLION FORTYSIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTYSIX TONS OF NEW STEEL RAILS SEE STATISTICAL ABSTRACT DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND LABOUR THE PRICE TO FOREIGN RAILROADS BEING SAY TWENTY DOLLARS PER TONAS WE NOW KNOWAND THE POOL PRICE TO AMERICAN RAILROADS BEING TWENTYEIGHT DOLLARS PER TON THAT MEANS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DURING THE SINGLE YEAR LAST PAST CONTRIBUTED A CLEAN NET PROFIT OF TWENTYFOUR MILLION THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTYEIGHT DOLLARS TO THE RAIL POOLBY REASON PRESUMABLY OF THEIR PATRIOTIC BELIEF IN THE DINGLEY DUTIES AND DURING THE PAST SIX YEARSSINCE THE DINGLEY BILL WAS ENACTEDTHESE SAME AMERICAN RAILROADS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FEW MEMBERS OF THE RAIL POOL EXACTLY ONE HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTYONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTYSIX DOLLARS OR EIGHT DOLLARS PER TON ON TWELVE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTYSEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTYSEVEN TONS OF RAILS BOUGHT AND USED DIVIDING THAT STUPENDOUS SUM OF PROTECTION PROFIT ONE HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTYONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTYSIX DOLLARS BY EIGHTY MILLION OF POPULATION WE SEE THAT THE RAIL POOL ALONETO SAY NOTHING OF OTHER COMBINATIONS SHELTERED BY THE DINGLEY DUTIESHAS COLLECTED A TAX OF EXACTLY ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTYEIGHT AND ONEQUARTER CENTS FOR EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN AMERICA WHITE AND COLOURED TO FURTHER INDICATE THE FABULOUS PROFITS WHICH THE DINGLEY DUTIES MAKE POSSIBLE TO OUR INFANT IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRIES I NEED ONLY CITE RECENT AND FAMILIAR RECORDS IN THE SPRING OF WHEN THE STEEL TRUST WAS IN PROCESS OF FORMATION AND WHEN IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR THE INFLUENTIAL MEN IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY TO PROVE WHAT ENORMOUS PROFITS THE STEEL MANUFACTURERS WERE MAKING AND THUS TO INDUCE THE INVESTING PUBLIC TO PUT THEIR MONEY INTO STEEL TRUST STOCKSTHEN IT WAS THAT MR CHARLES M SCHWAB PRESIDENT WROTE TO MR HENRY C FRICK CHAIRMAN OF THE CARNEGIE STEEL COMPANY THE FAMOUS LETTER OF MAY NOW PUBLIC PROPERTY IN WHICH MR SCHWAB USED THESE WORDS WHAT IS TRUE OF RAILS IS EQUALLY TRUE OF OTHER STEEL PRODUCTS YOU KNOW WE CAN MAKE RAILS FOR LESS THAN TWELVE DOLLARS PER TON LEAVING A NICE MARGIN ON FOREIGN BUSINESS MARK YOU THAT WAS IN WHEN THE BOOM WAS AT ITS ZENITH WHEN WAGES WERE HIGHEST AND WHEN ALL THE COSTS OF PRODUCTION WERE FAR ABOVE ALL AVERAGES OF RECENT BOOM YEARS TO SHOW HOW ACCURATE MR SCHWAB WAS IN THESE STATEMENTS AND TO SHOW HOW TRUSTWORTHY WAS HIS CONFIDENT FORECAST OF FUTURE PROFITS I NEED ONLY CITE THE FOLLOWING SPEAKING FIGURES FROM THE TWO ANNUAL STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC BY THE UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION NAMELY TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES TOTAL ANNUAL SALARIES AND WAGES PAID NET EARNINGS IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT DURING THESE TWO YEARS THE AVERAGE ANNUAL NET EARNINGS OF THE STEEL TRUST EXCEEDED THE TOTAL LABOUR COST OF THEIR ENTIRE PRODUCT MEDICINAL PRODUCTS TURNING FROM THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY WE MIGHT TAKE QUININE AND MANY OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS WE MIGHT TAKE CHEMICALS MANY OF THEM MOST ESSENTIAL IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY WE MIGHT TAKE BORAX WHICH SELLS IN AMERICA AT SEVEN AND ONEHALF CENTS PER POUND AND IN BRITAIN AT TWO AND ONEHALF CENTS PER POUND BECAUSE THE DINGLEY DUTY IS EXACTLY FIVE CENTS PER POUND WE MIGHT TAKE MICA A MINING PRODUCT LARGELY USED IN THE ELECTRICAL WALLPAPER AND STOVEMAKING INDUSTRIES AND WHICH ENJOYS A MODEST PROTECTION RANGING FROM ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO FOUR THOUSAND PER CENT IN SHORT WE MIGHT TAKE EACH AND EVERY STAPLE PRODUCT NOW MADE IN AMERICA AND NEEDLESSLY SHELTERED BY THE DINGLEY DUTIES AND PROVE BY COMPARATIVE PRICES AT HOME AND ABROAD THAT THE FABULOUS PROFITS WHICH THE GENTLEMEN ENGAGED IN THESE INDUSTRIES ARE NOW MAKINGAND WHICH THEY HAVE CAPITALISED INTO WATERED INDUSTRIALSARE DUE CHIEFLY AND DIRECTLY TO THE FOSTERING CARE OF THE DINGLEY BILL WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO PROTECT OUR INFANT INDUSTRIES IN THE SAME ISSUE ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT MR W J GIBSON SHOWS HOW THE GOVERNMENT SERVES AS A TOOL OF THE TRUSTS IN TARIFF EXACTIONS HE GIVES SEVERAL COLUMNS OF FACTS ABOUT SUCH OUTRAGES AS THE RUPEE CASES FOR INSTANCE THERE HAVE BEEN NINE OR TEN DECISIONS ON THIS ONE QUESTION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND STILL THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY REFUSES TO REFUND THE MONEY WHICH THE COURTS HAVE DECIDED SO OFTEN HE HAS EXACTED ILLEGALLY THE MONEY HE HAS DIRECTED TO BE WRONGFULLY ASSESSED AND COLLECTED AND IS RETAINING IN THESE CASES KNOWN AS THE RUPEE CASES AMOUNTS TO OVER A MILLION DOLLARS THE PARTIES CANNOT GET ANY INTEREST FOR THEIR MONEY SO WRONGFULLY WITHHELD AND THE CUSTOMS OFFICIALS ARE STILL BEING DIRECTED TO ASSESS ALL MERCHANDISE COMING FROM INDIA ON THE BASIS OF THE RUPEE AT THE VALUE OF THIRTYTWO CENTS IN OUR MONEY THIS HAS GONE ON FOR MORE THAN SIX YEARS AND AGAINST THE DECISION OF THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT SINCE JANUARY AND NOW CAN WE GET ANY BROAD VIEW OF THE RESULTS OF THIS LONG PROCESS OF WEALTHCONCENTRATION IN THE WEALTH OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ESTIMATED AT NINE BILLIONS IN IT WAS THIRTY BILLIONS IN IT WAS SIXTYFIVE BILLIONS AND IN IT WAS NINETYFIVE BILLIONS HOW IS THIS WEALTH DISTRIBUTED WRITING IN DR C B SPAHR MADE HIS FAMOUS CALCULATION EMBODIED IN THE STATEMENT THAT ONEEIGHTH OF THE POPULATION OWNED SEVENEIGHTHS OF THE WEALTH AND THAT ONE PER CENT OWNED MORE THAN THE REMAINING NINETYNINE PER CENT AND AT THAT TIME THE MACHINERY OF EXPLOITATION HAD HARDLY MORE THAN GOT UNDER WAY THE BEST ATTEMPT AT AN ESTIMATE SINCE THEN IS THE ONE BY LUCIEN SANIAL PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN BRANCH OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE THIS IS THE RESULT OF A CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF THE CENSUS OF IT SHOWS THAT OF NINETYFIVE BILLIONS OF THE COUNTRYS PRESENT WEALTH SIXTYSEVEN BILLIONS ARE OWNED BY A CAPITALISTCLASS OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PERSONS TWENTYFOUR BILLIONS BY A MIDDLE CLASS OF EIGHT MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PERSONS AND FOUR BILLIONS BY A WORKINGCLASS OF OVER TWENTY MILLION PERSONS AND NOW IF THE SIXTYSEVEN BILLIONS OWNED BY THE CAPITALISTS BE ASSUMED TO EARN TEN PER CENTWHICH IS SURELY A REASONABLE AVERAGE AMOUNTOUR PEOPLE WILL BE PAYING INTEREST UPON FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS AT THE END OF THE TWENTY YEAR PERIOD AND THAT REPRESENTS THE CENTRALISATION OF THE ACTUAL OWNERSHIP OF WEALTH BUT ONE DOES NOT GET A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE SITUATION UNTIL HE BEGINS TO CONSIDER THE CENTRALISATION OF THE CONTROL OF WEALTH IN EXPLAINING THE STRUGGLE OVER THE SURPLUS OF THE LIFEINSURANCE COMPANIES ONE OF OUR FINANCIAL MAGNATES REMARKED TO ME I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE POWER OF MANIPULATING FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAN THE ACTUAL OWNERSHIP OF FIFTY MILLIONS AND WITH THAT CRUCIAL FACT IN MIND LET ONE CONSIDER THE FIGURES GIVEN BY MR SERENO S PRATT IN THE WORLDS WORK FOR DECEMBER AND SUMMARISED IN DR STRONGS SOCIAL PROGRESS AS FOLLOWS ONETWELFTH OF THE ESTIMATED WEALTH OF THE UNITED STATES IS REPRESENTED AT THE MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION THEY REPRESENT AS INFLUENTIAL DIRECTORS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED OTHER COMPANIES THESE COMPANIES OPERATE NEARLY ONEHALF OF THE RAILROAD MILEAGE OF THE UNITED STATES THEY ARE THE GREAT MINERS AND CARRIERS OF COAL THE LEADING TELEGRAPH SYSTEM THE TRACTION LINES OF NEW YORK OF PHILADELPHIA OF PITTSBURG OF BUFFALO OF CHICAGO AND OF MILWAUKEE AND ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL EXPRESS COMPANIES ARE REPRESENTED IN THE BOARD THIS GROUP INCLUDES ALSO DIRECTORS OF FIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES TWO OF WHICH HAVE ASSETS OF SEVEN HUNDRED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE STEEL BOARD ARE MEN WHO SPEAK FOR FIVE BANKS AND TEN TRUST COMPANIES IN NEW YORK CITY INCLUDING THE FIRST NATIONAL THE NATIONAL CITY AND THE BANK OF COMMERCE THE THREE GREATEST BANKS IN THE COUNTRY AND THE HEADS OF IMPORTANT CHAINS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TELEPHONE ELECTRIC REAL ESTATE CABLE AND PUBLISHING COMPANIES ARE REPRESENTED THERE AND OUR GREATEST MERCHANT SITS AT THE BOARD TABLE WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL WEALTH OF THESE MEN IS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AND BESIDE THE POINT TO ESTIMATE BUT ONE OF THEM MR JOHN D ROCKEFELLER IS GENERALLY ESTIMATED TO BE THE RICHEST INDIVIDUAL IN THE WORLD BUT IT IS NOT THE PERSONAL BUT THE REPRESENTATIVE WEALTH OF THOSE MEN THAT MAKES THE GROUP EXTRAORDINARY THEY CONTROL CORPORATIONS WHOSE CAPITALISATIONS AGGREGATE MORE THAN NINE BILLION DOLLARSAN AMOUNT IF THE CAPITALISATIONS ARE REAL VALUES EQUAL TO ABOUT THE COMBINED PUBLIC DEBTS OF GREAT BRITAIN FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES IT IS THIS CONCENTRATION OF POWER WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT THERE WERE AT THE TIME OF THE LAST STATEMENT SIXTYNINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTYFIVE STOCKHOLDERS IN THE STEEL CORPORATION BUT THE CONTROL OF THIS CORPORATION IS VESTED IN TWENTYFOUR DIRECTORS AND THIS BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS GUIDED BY THE EXECUTIVE AND FINANCE COMMITTEES WHICH IN TURN ARE LARGELY DIRECTED BY THEIR CHAIRMEN WHO ARE PROBABLY SELECTED BY THE GREAT BANKER WHO ORGANISED THE CORPORATION AND IN A LARGE PART SWAYS ITS POLICY EXAMINATIONS SHOW THAT THE CONCENTRATION OF CONTROL OF THESE GREAT NEW YORK CITY BANKS HAS GONE SO FAR THAT A COMPARATIVELY SMALL GROUP OF CAPITALISTS POSSESSES THE POWER TO REGULATE THE FLOW OF CREDIT IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE LAST ANALYSIS IT IS FOUND THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY ONLY TWO MAIN INFLUENCES AND THAT THESE ARE CENTRED IN MR MORGAN AND MR ROCKEFELLER IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPRESS IN APPROXIMATE FIGURES THE EXTENT OF THE MORGAN INFLUENCEWHICH THE WRITER SHOWS IN A TABLE TO FIGURE UP OVER SIX BILLION TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTYEIGHT MILLION DOLLARS HOW VERY CONSERVATIVE IS MR PRATTS ESTIMATE IS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT HE GIVES THE NUMBER OF HOLDERS OF SHARES OF THE RAILROADS OF THIS COUNTRY AS NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PERSONS WITH WHICH THE READER MAY CONTRAST THE FOLLOWING EDITORIAL PARAGRAPH FROM A RECENT ISSUE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES IT WOULD APPEAR FROM EVIDENCE COLLECTED BY THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION AND COMMUNICATED TO THE SENATE THAT THE OWNERSHIP OF THE RAILROAD SYSTEM OF THIS COUNTRY IS NOT AS WIDELY DIFFUSED AS HAS BEEN SUPPOSED ON THE TH OF JUNE THE RAILROADS REPORTING TO THE COMMISSION HAD ONLY STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD THIS TOTAL INCLUDES MANY DUPLICATIONS AS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW IN HOW MANY INSTANCES ONE CAPITALIST WAS REPRESENTED IN THE STOCKHOLDING INTEREST OF SEVERAL RAILROADS ASSUMING THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES TO BE IN ROUND FIGURES EIGHTY MILLIONS THE ENTIRE MILEAGE OF THE RAILROADS DOING AN INTERSTATE BUSINESS IS OWNED BY ABOUT FOURTENTHS OF PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY SUCH IS THE SITUATION IT COMPLETES OUR VIEW OF THE PROCESS OF INDUSTRIAL EVOLUTION SO FAR AS IT HAS PROGRESSED UP TO DATE THE CONDITION IS LIKE THAT OF AN OAK TREE PLANTED IN A JAR OR A CHICK DEVELOPING WITHIN ITS SHELL THE INDEFINITE CONTINUANCE OF THE PROCESS IS INCONCEIVABLE WHAT FORM THE COLLAPSE WILL ASSUME AND WHEN IT MAY BE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IS THE PROBLEM NEXT TO BE TAKEN UP CHAPTER VI THE REVOLUTION ONE IS AT A GREAT DISADVANTAGE JUST AT PRESENT IN PICTURING AN INDUSTRIAL CRISIS WE ARE AT THE VERY FLOODTIDE OF PROSPERITY THE RAILROADS ARE PARALYSED BY THE VOLUME OF THE COUNTRYS BUSINESS THE COAL MINES CANNOT FURNISH THE COAL AND THE FARMERS ARE BURNING THEIR GRAIN BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET IT TO MARKET THE STEEL TRUST HAS ORDERS FOR TWO YEARS AHEADAND SO ON WITHOUT LIMIT I HAVE TO ASK THE READER TO PICTURE INTEREST RATES GOING DOWN TO ZERO AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE HIGHER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN A DECADE I HAVE TO ASK HIM TO PICTURE TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING IN THE COUNTRY AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OF ANYTHING AND YET ALL THIS EXCESS OF PROSPERITY IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PHENOMENON WE ARE STUDYING IF THE PROCESS OF WEALTHCONCENTRATION AND OVERPRODUCTION OF CAPITAL WENT ON UNMODIFIED BY ANY OTHER FACTOR WE SHOULD WITNESS A GRADUAL RISE IN THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES A GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF UNEMPLOYED AND A GRADUAL FALL IN THE RATES OF INTEREST AS IT HAPPENS HOWEVER THE MOVEMENT PROCEEDS IN RHYTHMIC PULSES LIKE THE SWINGING OF A PENDULUM OR THE EBBING AND FLOWING OF THE TIDE THIS IS OWING TO THE FACTOR OF CREDITEXPANSION WHICH WE HAVE STILL TO INTERPRET WE HAVE PICTURED CAPITAL UBIQUITOUS ENDLESSLY RESOURCEFUL INCESSANTLY ALERTCLAMOURING FOR DIVIDENDS COMPETITION IS A FORCINGPROCESS BY WHICH EVERY DEVICE THAT WILL INCREASE PROFITS IS DRIVEN INTO GENERAL USE AND SUBJECTED TO ITS MAXIMUM STRAIN THE MOST OBVIOUS OF THESE DEVICES IS THAT OF CREDIT A BUSINESS MAN HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CAPITAL IF HE MAKES HIS TURN OVER ONCE A YEAR HE GAINS SAY TEN PER CENT PROFIT IF HE CAN MAKE THE TURN OVER TWICE A YEAR HE GAINS TWENTY PER CENT HE SEES THE BUSINESS AHEAD AND SO HE GOES INTO DEBT AND OF COURSE THIS STEP GIVES AN IMPULSE TO THE BUSINESS OF THE MAN WHO MANUFACTURES HIS MACHINERY AND TO THE MAN WHO RAISES HIS RAW MATERIAL AND TO THE RAILROADS WHICH HANDLE BOTH THE EFFECT OF THAT CONDITION PREVAILING THROUGHOUT A WHOLE COMMUNITY IS TO ACCELERATE ENORMOUSLY THE INDUSTRIAL PROCESS UNDER IT THE CAPITAL OF THE COMMUNITY BECOMES EXACTLY AS IN THE CASE OF THE RAILROADS NOT THE ACTUAL DEFINITE COST OF THE INSTRUMENTS OF PRODUCTION EXISTING BUT AN ALTOGETHER HYPOTHETICAL THING A FUNCTION OF ANTICIPATED EARNINGS SO IT IS THAT YOU HAVE A BOOMA PERIOD OF FURIOUS AND FEVERED ACTIVITY IN WHICH EVERYONE SEES FORTUNES SPRINGING UP ABOUT HIM AND THEN COMES SOME DISTURBING FACTOR WHICH SUGGESTS TO A NUMBER OF MEN THE ADVISABILITY OF REALISING ON THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND A CHILL SETTLES UPON THE COMMUNITY AND THERE IS A WILD RUSH TO COLLECT AND THE DISCOVERY IS MADE THAT MOST OF THE ANTICIPATED PROFITS ARE NOT IN EXISTENCE THERE IS ONE MORE CONSIDERATION WHICH HAS TO BE TOUCHED UPON BEFORE WE ARE PREPARED TO CONSIDER THE CONCRETE PROBLEM IN AMERICA THE PROCESS WHICH HAS BEEN OUTLINED IS AN INDUSTRIAL ONE EVENTS HAVE BEEN PICTURED HERE AS THEY WOULD TAKE PLACE IN A COMMUNITY GIVEN ALTOGETHER TO MANUFACTURING MINING AND TRANSPORTATION BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT WE HAVE NOT ONLY TO RECKON WITH THIRTEEN BILLIONS A YEAR OF MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS BUT ALSO WITH FOUR BILLIONS A YEAR OF FARM PRODUCTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS NEW ELEMENT LIES IN THE FACT THAT THE OWNERSHIP OF THE FARMS IS STILL LARGELY IN THE HANDS OF THE MASSES WHICH MEANS THAT ONCE EVERY YEAR THE PROCESS WE HAVE BEEN PICTURING IS STAYED WHILE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET RID OF FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF SPENDING MONEY WHICH COMES TO THEM OUTSIDE OF AND INDEPENDENT OF THE WAGEFUND THUS STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM ABUNDANT CROPS TEND TO MITIGATE AN OVERPRODUCTION CRISIS WHILE A FAILURE OF CROPS WOULD DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD TO PRECIPITATE ONE WITH THESE FACTS IN MIND WE ARE NOW IN POSITION TO INTERPRET OUR RECENT INDUSTRIAL HISTORY WE HAVE GENERALLY HAD OUR HARD TIMES IN AMERICA AT TEN YEAR INTERVALS WITH ESPECIALLY SEVERE CRISES AT TWENTY YEAR INTERVALS WE HAD OUR LAST SEVERE ATTACK IN AND WE WERE DUE TO HAVE ONE OF THE LESSER SORT IN WHAT HAPPENED THEN WAS VERY INTERESTING TO WATCH IN THE LIGHT OF THE VIEWS JUST EXPLAINED IN THE EARLY WINTER AND SPRING OF THE AVALANCHE WAS WELL UNDER WAY HERE FOR INSTANCE IS AN ITEM CLIPPED FROM THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE IN APRIL OF THAT YEAR ORGANISED LABOUR IS FACING THE GREATEST WAGE CRISIS SINCE THE PANIC OF IF THE FORECAST OF ITS LEADERS IS CORRECT IT IS ESTIMATED THAT BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR THE GREATEST EMPLOYING CONCERNS OF THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE DISMISSED NEARLY ONE MILLION MEN MOST OF THEM LABOURERS AND GENERALUTILITY WORKERS OF THIS NUMBER THE RAILROADS ARE EXPECTED TO DISCHARGE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THE MINE OPERATORS FIFTY THOUSAND THE MACHINE SHOPS IRON STEEL AND TIN PLATE PLANTS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AND THE BUILDING TRADES FORTY THOUSAND THE RAILROADS AND THE STEEL MILLS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN THE WORK OF REDUCING THEIR FORCES AND THE WAGE LIQUIDATION THREATENS TO BECOME AS SENSATIONAL AS WAS THE RECENT LIQUIDATION IN STOCKS AND THEN ON MAY TH FOLLOWING THE NEW YORK HERALD REPORTED THAT THE RAILROADS OF THE COUNTRY HAD LAID OFF SEVENTYFIVE THOUSAND MEN AND QUOTED THE FOLLOWING IN AN INTERVIEW WITH JAMES J HILL THE WHOLE QUESTION FALLS BACK PRIMARILY UPON DECREASING BUSINESS AND THE REASON FOR IT WHY ARE THE RAILROADS CARRYING LESS FREIGHT THAN THEY WERE A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE THE DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS OF THE UNITED STATES IS NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE SUPPLY WE MANUFACTURE AND WE GROW AND WE MINE MORE THAN WE CAN CONSUME IN THE UNITED STATES HENCE WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON FOREIGN MARKETS IN ORDER TO SELL THE SURPLUS THE REASONS WHY WE GOT OVER THIS PERIOD OF LIQUIDATION WITH ONLY A SEVERE SCARE ARE TWO FIRST BECAUSE THERE CAME IN THE FALL A BUMPER CROP OF UNPRECEDENTED PROPORTIONS WHICH GAVE THE RAILROADS A NEW START AND SECOND AND MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HAPPENED THAT AT THE PRECISE HOUR OF OUR STRESS THERE BROKE OUT ONE OF THE GREATEST MILITARY STRUGGLES OF ALL HISTORY THE WAR YOU UNDERSTAND WAS A NEW WORLDMARKET ALL AT ONCE A MILLION OR TWO OF MEN WERE SET TO WORK AT DESTROYING MANUFACTURED ARTICLES AND AT THE SAME TIME SEVERAL MILLIONS MORE WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR REGULAR TASKS TO PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN THEM WHILE THEY DID IT AND THE GREATER PART OF THE SURPLUS CAPITAL OF CIVILISATION WAS DRAWN OFF TO PAY THE BILLS IT WAS NOT MERELY THAT DURING THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THE CONFLICT JAPAN AND RUSSIA BOUGHT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF OUR SPARE PRODUCTS OR THAT THEY TOOK HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF OUR SPARE CASH IT MADE NO REAL DIFFERENCE WHERE THE MONEY WAS RAISED OR WHERE IT WAS SPENT THE MAN WHO GOT IT SPENT IT AGAIN AND SOONER OR LATER THE BULK OF IT CAME TO US BECAUSE WE HAD THE THINGS TO SELL UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF MODERN CAPITALISM ALL THE WORLD IS ONE AND WHEN A NATION GOES TO WAR WHOEVER HAS A SPARE DOLLAR LENDS IT TO PAY THE BILLS AND WHEREVER IN THE WORLD THERE IS AN IDLE LABOURER HE IS PUT TO WORK TO HELP SUPPORT THE FIGHTERS OF BOTH NATIONS IN RETURN THE WORLD GETS FROM THE WARRING GOVERNMENTS A PAPER PROMISE TO WRING AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF SERVICE OUT OF THEIR PEOPLE AT SOME FUTURE DATE BEFORE GOING ON I OUGHT TO MENTION THAT THERE IS ANOTHER VIEW OF THE EVENTS OF I HAVE HEARD MR ARTHUR BRISBANE MAINTAIN THAT WE ARE TO HAVE NO MORE OVERPRODUCTION CRISES FOR THE REASON THAT COMPETITION HAVING BEEN ABOLISHED IN ALL OUR PRINCIPAL INDUSTRIES OUR TRUST MAGNATES CAN SO ADJUST SUPPLY TO DEMAND AS TO MITIGATE THE STRESS AND GIVE INSTEAD PERIODS OF PARTIAL IDLENESS IN WIDELY SCATTERED INDUSTRIES ILLUSTRATION DIAGRAM PREPARED BY WILSHIRES MAGAZINE DIAGRAM SHOWS HOW HIGH PRICES FOLLOW WARS RANGE OF AVERAGE PRICES OF LEADING RAILWAY STOCKS FOR THE PAST YEARS IF THIS IS TRUE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR IT MEANS A LONG CONTINUANCE OF TRUST GOVERNMENT BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS TRUE THE TRUSTS HAVE OF COURSE PUT AN END TO BLIND PRODUCTION WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE OF A MARKET BUT EVEN ASSUMING THAT OUR INDUSTRY WERE SO FAR SYSTEMATISED AND OUR MANAGEMENT SO CONSERVATIVE THAT WE NEVER MANUFACTURED GOODS EXCEPT UPON A DEFINITE ORDERHOW WOULD THAT BE ABLE TO HOLD IN CHECK A COMMUNITY GONE MAD WITH PROSPERITYDRUNKENNESS FOR INSTANCE THE STEEL TRUST NOW HAS ORDERS ENOUGH AHEAD FOR TWO YEARS AND UPON THE BASIS OF THESE ORDERS ITS ADMINISTRATORS ARE GOING AHEAD BUILDING A NEW STEEL CITY YET DOES THE STEEL TRUST KNOW WHAT PROPORTION OF ITS ORDERS FOR STEEL RAILS ARE INTENDED FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF PURELY SPECULATIVE FREIGHT DOES IT KNOW WHAT PROPORTION OF ITS ORDERS FOR STRUCTURAL STEEL IS INTENDED FOR BUILDINGS FOR IMAGINARY TENANTS DOES IT CONCERN ITSELF WITH THE PROBLEM WHETHER ITS CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND ANY USE FOR THE MATERIALS WHICH THEY HAVE BOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE MORE PLAUSIBILITY IN THE ARGUMENT IF OUR TRUST MAGNATES WERE MEN OF CONSCIENCE AND A KEEN SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD THEIR WORK IS PURELY PREDATORY THEY ARE NOT ADMINISTRATORS OF PRODUCTION AT ALL BUT PARASITES UPON PRODUCTION EXPLOITERS AND WRECKERS FAR FROM STRIVING TO REGULATE THE MADNESS OF THE PUBLIC THEY ARE COMPETING AMONG THEMSELVES TO FAN IT TO A FLAME SO THAT THEY MAY CAPITALISE THE EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR OWN PROPERTIES FOOTNOTE ANYONE WHO WISHES TO MAKE A SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THE TRUE FUNCTIONS OF MODERN FINANCE IS ADVISED TO READ PROFESSOR VEBLENS LAST BOOK THE THEORY OF BUSINESS ENTERPRISE A MOST EXTRAORDINARY STUDY OF THE WHOLE FIELD OF PRESENTDAY ECONOMICS IN MY OPINION THIS BOOK TOGETHER WITH ITS AUTHORS OTHER MASTERPIECE THE THEORY OF THE LEISURE CLASS CONSTITUTES THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIAL SCIENCE EVER MADE IN AMERICA AND PERHAPS THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD SINCE CARL MARX IT MIGHT BE WORTH WHILE TO ADD IN PASSING THAT PROFESSOR VEBLEN WAS TURNED OUT OF MR ROCKEFELLERS UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO FOR WRITING IT THE EBB OF THE TIDE IS COMING THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHEN ACCORDING TO PRECEDENT IT SHOULD COME IN BUT I EXPECT IT MUCH SOONER PARTLY BECAUSE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE HAD ANYTHING LIKE A THOROUGH LIQUIDATION IN AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME VIOLENCE OF THE PRESENT ACTIVITY DURING THE LAST YEAR THE BOOM HAS REACHED REAL ESTATE AND THAT ALWAYS MEANS THAT OTHER AVENUES OF INVESTMENT ARE CLOGGED I ANTICIPATE THE STORM IN OR BUT I DO NOT PREDICT IT BECAUSE IT DEPENDS UPON UNCERTAIN FACTORS ANOTHER GREAT WAR MIGHT PUT IT OFF TEN YEARS AND ON THE OTHER HAND CROP FAILURES MIGHT PRECIPITATE IT THIS SUMMER WHAT I DO BELIEVE THAT I CAN PREDICTFOR REASONS WHICH I STATED IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THIS ARGUMENTIS THE COURSE WHICH POLITICAL EVENTS IN THIS COUNTRY WILL TAKE FROM THE HOUR WHEN THE HARD TIMES ARRIVE AS WE SAW FROM THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE ITEM THE FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE IS THE TURNING OUT OF WORK OF A MILLION WORKINGMEN AND WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCESTHE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCESOF THE TURNING OUT OF WORK OF A MILLION MEN ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS THE AVERAGE YEARLY WAGE OF THE FACTORY EMPLOYEE IS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTYSEVEN DOLLARS DR PETER ROBERTS SAYS THAT THE AVERAGE WAGE IN THE ANTHRACITE COAL DISTRICT IS LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE MIDDLE STATES A THIRD OF ALL THE WORKERS GET LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED A YEAR AND IN THE SOUTH NEARLY SIXTY PER CENT GET LESS IT WAS PROVEN BEFORE THE INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION THAT THE MAXIMUM WAGE OF THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND RAILROAD AND TRACK HANDS AND THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CARMEN AND SHOPMEN WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IN THE SOUTH AND LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE IN THE NORTH AND THIS TO FEED AND CLOTHE A FAMILY AND PROVIDE AGAINST SICKNESS ACCIDENT AND OLD AGE THE MEANING OF IT IS SIMPLY THAT WHEN A MILLION MEN ARE LAID OFF IN A MONTH OR TWO THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE STARVING AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND MEANS A LOSS OF A MARKETOF A MARKET OF FIVE MILLION PEOPLEA POPULATION EQUAL TO THAT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA AND OF COURSE THEREFORE THOSE WHOSE WORK IT HAS BEEN TO SUPPLY THESE PEOPLE WILL BE OUT OF WORK AND LIKEWISE THOSE WHO SUPPLY THE SUPPLIERS AND EVEN THIS IS BY FAR THE LEAST OF THE CONSEQUENCES FOR ANOTHER PART OF OUR DOMESTIC MARKET DEPENDS UPON THE FACT THAT OUR WORKINGMEN TOO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM TRUSTS AND WHEN THIS PERIOD OF DEPRESSION COMES THEIR TRUSTS WILL FALL TO PIECES AND COMPETITION WILL BEGIN AGAINA PROCESS WHICH THEY WILL FIND ALL THE BRICKBATS AND DYNAMITE IN THE COUNTRY CANNOT CHECK THE EMPLOYERS WILL OF COURSE BE STRAINING EVERY NERVE TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND SO WAGES WILL GO DOWN AND WHEN STRIKES ARE DECLARED THE STARVING WORKINGMAN WILL SCAB AND THE STRIKES WILL FAIL WE SHALL HAVE RIOTS AND PERHAPS GATLING GUNS IN OUR STREETS BUT THE WAGES WILL GO DOWN AND STEP BY STEP AS THE WAGES GO DOWN CONSUMPTION GOES DOWN WITH THE LOSS OF ANOTHER DOMINION OF CANADA WHEN THE THING IS ONCE STARTED IT WILL BE AN AVALANCHE THAT NO POWER UPON EARTH CAN STOP AND IT WILL BE THE BEGINNING OF THE REVOLUTION THE WORD HAS AN OMINOUS SOUND THE READER THINKS OF STREET BATTLES AND BARRICADES BY A REVOLUTION I MEAN THE COMPLETE TRANSFER OF THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POWER OF THE COUNTRY FROM THE HANDS OF THE PRESENT EXPLOITING CLASS TO THE HANDS OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE AND IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THIS PURPOSE THE PEOPLE WILL PROCEED AS IN EVERYTHING ELSE THEY DO ALONG THE LINE OF LEAST RESISTANCE IT IS VERY MUCH LESS TROUBLE TO CAST A BALLOT THAN IT IS TO GO OUT IN THE STREETS AND SHOOT AND OUR PEOPLE ARE USED TO THE BALLOT METHOD HOWEVER THE STAID AND RESPECTABLE HARPERS WEEKLY WHICH CALLS ITSELF A JOURNAL OF CIVILISATION SUGGESTED IN THAT IF MR BRYAN WERE ELECTED IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY FOR THE PROPERTIED CLASSES TO KEEP HIM OUT OF OFFICE IF ANYTHING OF THAT SORT IS ATTEMPTED IN THIS COMING CRISIS WHY THEN THERE WILL BE VIOLENCEJUST AS THERE WILL BE IN SUCH COUNTRIES AS GERMANY AND RUSSIA WHICH HAVE YET TO LEARN TO LET THE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OWN WAY THE WORST FEATURE OF THE SITUATION WITH US IS THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE HABIT OF LETTING OUR ELECTIONS BE CARRIED BY BRIBERY AND THAT IS LIKELY TO PLAY US SOME UGLY TRICKS IN THIS NEW EMERGENCY THE READER PERHAPS OBJECTS TO MY THEORY THAT THIS CHANGE MUST COME WITH SUDDENNESS IT IS SUCH A TREMENDOUS CHANGEAND WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER IF IT WERE BROUGHT ABOUT LITTLE BY LITTLE UNDOUBTEDLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL BETTER BUT THE TIME TO BEGIN WAS TEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO NOW THE HORSE IS STOLEN AND WE ARE VENTING ALL OUR ENERGIES AND CANNOT EVEN SUCCEED IN GETTING THE STABLEDOOR LOCKED AFTERWARD THEY ARE BRINGING IT ABOUT GRADUALLY IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALANDTHE ONLY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD IN WHICH THE PEOPLE ARE EFFECTUALLY REGULATING THE PROGRESS OF THE JUGGERNAUT OF CAPITALISM THAT IS BECAUSE THESE COUNTRIES ARE VERY YOUNG WITH COMPARATIVELY LITTLE CAPITAL NO SLUMS AND AN INTELLIGENT WORKINGCLASS I HAVE AN IDEAI DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THERE IS ANYTHING IN ITTHAT THE EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS OF NEW ZEALAND MAY IN PART BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS A CONVICTSETTLEMENT THE MEN WHOM CAPITALISM MAKES INTO CRIMINALS BEING FOR THE MOST PART A VERY SUPERIOR CLASS OF PEOPLE ACTIVE INDEPENDENT AND IMPATIENT OF INJUSTICE TRANSPORTED TO A NEW LAND AND GIVEN A FAIR CHANCE I SHOULD THINK THAT A BURGLAR OR A HIGHWAYMAN OUGHT TO MAKE A VERY EXCELLENT SOCIALIST YOU ASK PERHAPS IF THE THING IS NOT ALSO BEING ACCOMPLISHED GRADUALLY IN ENGLAND AND ON THE CONTINENT YOU POINT TO MUNICIPAL TRADING TO THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL TO THE STATEOWNED RAILROADS AND TELEPHONES OF GERMANY SWITZERLAND SWEDEN ETC YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR THESE THINGS REFERRED TO AS STATE SOCIALISM AND YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THE STATEMENTNOT UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ESSENCE OF SOCIALISM IS DEMOCRACY AND THAT IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO PATERNALISM IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE FORM MUNICIPAL AND STATE OWNERSHIP IS NOT STATE SOCIALISM AT ALL BUT STATE CAPITALISM UNDER IT THE GOVERNMENT BUYS CERTAIN FRANCHISES PAYS FOR THEM WITH BONDS AND THEN RUNS THE ROADS TO PAY THE BONDHOLDERS UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS A BETTER SYSTEM FOR THE PEOPLE THAN PRIVATE CAPITALISM FOR THE REASON THAT IT FIXES THE EXPLOITERS TAX INSTEAD OF LETTING STOCKWATERING GO ON INDEFINITELY BUT UNFORTUNATELY ECONOMICAL ADMINISTRATION BY THE STATE IS POSSIBLE AT PRESENT ONLY IN SUCH COUNTRIES AS HAVE AN ARISTOCRATIC GOVERNINGCLASS JEALOUS OF THE POWER OF THE CAPITALIST IN THIS COUNTRY THE HOLDERS OF THE MUNICIPAL BONDS WHO ALSO OWN THE STREETCAR FACTORIES AND THE STEEL MILLS AND THE COAL MINES WOULD USE THE INTEREST THEY GOT FROM THE CITY TO BRIBE THE CITYS SERVANTS TO PAY EXORBITANT PRICES FOR ALL THE STREETCARS AND STEEL RAILS AND COAL AND OTHER SUPPLIES WHICH THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE IN ORDER TO OPERATE THE ROADS YOU HAVE SEEN THAT PERFECTLY ILLUSTRATED IN THE CASE OF OUR POST OFFICE FOR EXAMPLE WE PAY THE RAILROADS IN RENT FOR OUR MAILCARS TWICE AS MUCH PER YEAR AS IT COSTS TO BUILD THE CARS AND THE CARS ARE SO FLIMSY THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WHICH OWN A LARGE SHARE OF THE RAILROADS AND THE CARS REFUSE TO INSURE THE LIVES OF THE MAILCLERKS WHO WORK IN THEM HOWEVER THE ADVISABILITY OF MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS IS A PURELY ACADEMIC QUESTION FOR THE REASON THAT THE CAPITALIST WILL NEVER GIVE US A CHANCE TO TRY IT THE CAPITALIST IS IN POSSESSION AND HE STANDS PAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT REFORM HE WILL MAKE YOU AS MANY FINE SPEECHES AND DELIVER YOU AS MANY MORAL DISCOURSES AS YOU WISH BUT WHEN IT COMES TO GIVING UP ANY DOLLARSHE HAS SPENT ALL HIS LIFETIME LEARNING TO HOLD ON TO HIS DOLLARS YOU ARE THINKING PERHAPS OF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT WHO IS HAILED AS A SUCCESSFUL REFORMER IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS OF IMPORTANCE TO POINT OUT THAT PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT IS A COMPLETE ANOMALY IN OUR POLITICAL LIFE HE WAS PROBABLY THE LAST REPUBLICAN IN THE COUNTRY WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO RULE US HE MADE HIMSELF GOVERNOR BY A SHREWD DEVICE CALLED THE ROUGH RIDERS HE WAS MADE PRESIDENT FOR THE FIRST TIME BY THE BULLET OF AN ASSASSIN AND THE SECOND TIME BY THE DEATH OF MARK HANNA BY A SERIES OF SUCH BLIND CHANCES AS THESE THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE TO VOTE FOR WHAT THEY WANT AND THEY OF COURSE HAVE SEIZED THE CHANCE BUT ASSUREDLY IT WAS NO PART OF THE SYSTEMS PLAN TO ASK THEM WHAT THEY WANTED NOR EVEN TO LET THEM FIND OUT WHAT THEY WANTED THEMSELVES UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING FOR THE SYSTEM TO DO BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE PRESIDENT ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING AND THAT IT HAS DONE AS A MATTER OF COURSE IN SAYING THIS LET ME REMIND THE READER ONCE MORE OF MY DISTINCTION BETWEEN MORAL REVOLT AND ECONOMIC REMEDY I HAVE NO WISH TO UNDERESTIMATE THE TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE OF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELTS SERVICES IN AWAKENING THE PEOPLE BUT I SAY THAT SO FAR AS ACTUAL CONCRETE ACCOMPLISHMENT IS CONCERNED HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL NEVER HAVE LIFTED A FINGER IN ONE CASE THAT OF THE SUIT AGAINST THE PAPER TRUST HE DID EFFECT A LOWERING OF PRICES BUT IN THAT CASE HE WAS SIMPLY A PAWN IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN TWO TRUSTSOF WHICH THE NEWSPAPER TRUST PROVED TO BE THE STRONGER IN NO CASE WHERE THE PEOPLE ALONE WERE CONCERNED HAS HE EFFECTED ANY ECONOMIC CHANGE WHATEVER THE NORTHERN SECURITIES DECISION WAS EVADED BY ANOTHER DEVICE THE BEEF TRUST AND THE STANDARD OIL SUITS ENDED WITH NOMINAL FINES OVER THE RATE REGULATION QUESTION WE HAD TWO YEARS AGITATIONAND NOT ONE SINGLE RATE HAS BEEN LOWERED IN THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFEINSURANCE REFORM TO WHICH THE PRESIDENT GAVE ALL HIS MORAL SUPPORT A FEW GRAFTING OFFICIALS WERE HOUNDED TO DEATH BUT THE REAL AND VITAL EVIL THE EXPLOITATION OF THE SURPLUS FOR PURPOSES OF STOCKMANIPULATION WAS SCARCELY EVEN TOUCHED UPON AND THEN CAME THE CHICAGO PACKINGHOUSE SCANDALSAND I CAN SPEAK WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THEM SOMETIMES WHEN I LOOK BACK UPON THEM IT SEEMS LIKE A DREAMI CAN HARDLY BELIEVE THAT I EVER PLAYED MY PART IN THAT COSMIC FARCE ONLY THINK OF ITWE HAD THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS AND ALL THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE COUNTRY DISCUSSING ITWE HAD THIS ENTIRE NATION OF EIGHTY MILLION PEOPLE LITERALLY THINKING ABOUT NOTHING ELSE FOR MONTHSNAY MORE WE HAD THE ATTENTION OF THE WHOLE CIVILISED WORLD RIVETED UPON THOSE FILTHY MEATFACTORIES WE UNCOVERED CRIMES FOR WHICH THE CONDEMNATION OF EVERY DOLLARS WORTH OF PROPERTY IN PACKINGTOWN WOULD HAVE BEEN A NOMINAL PUNISHMENT AND THEN WE SETTLED BACK WITH A SIGH OF CONTENTMENT BECAUSE WE HAD PUT A FEW MORE INSPECTORS AT WORK AND FORCED THE WHITEWASHING OF SOME SLAUGHTERHOUSE WALLS AND WE LEFT THE MONSTER UPASTREE OF COMMERCIALISM TO FLOURISH UNTOUCHEDTO GO ON YEAR AFTER YEAR BEARING ITS FRUIT OF CORRUPTION AND DEATH THERE IS NOTHING WHATEVER TO BE GOT FROM THE CAPITALIST I USED TO THINK THAT THE SAME THING WAS TRUE OF THE POLITICIAN IN COMMON WITH MOST SOCIALISTS I THOUGHT THAT THE REVOLUTION WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE PEOPLE HAD COME TO FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THEIR PURPOSE AND HAD ELECTED A SOCIALIST PRESIDENT AND A SOCIALIST CONGRESS BUT AT THE TIME OF THE COALSTRIKE WHEN DAVE HILL CAME OUT FOR GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF THE COAL MINES I REALISED THAT THE POLITICIAN IS THE JACKAL AND NOT THE LION OF COURSE WE HAVE AMATEUR POLITICIANSCAPITALISTS WHO PLAY AT THE GAMEAND THEY WILL NOT GIVE WAY BUT THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN IS NOT A RICH MANTHE COMPETITION HAS BEEN TOO KEEN HE HAS SERVED THE CAPITALIST BECAUSE IT PAID AND WHEN THE PEOPLE GET READY TO HAVE THEIR WAY IT WILL PAY TO SERVE THE PEOPLE THIS IS REALLY A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER FOR OUR POLITICAL MACHINERY IS COMPLICATED AND THE PEOPLE HAVE GOT USED TO IT IT WOULD BE A FRIGHTFUL WASTE OF ENERGY TO CREATE NEW MACHINERYIN FACT I DO NOT THINK THAT OUR CONSTITUTION COULD STAND THE STRAIN WE WILL NOW ASSUME THAT THE INDUSTRIAL CRISIS HAS COME WHAT WILL BE THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES IT TAKES TWO OR THREE YEARS FOR INDUSTRIAL CONDITIONS TO GET THEMSELVES TRANSLATED INTO POLITICAL ACTS IN THIS COUNTRY IT MEANS AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF AGITATINGTENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEETINGS HAVE TO BE HELD AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SPEECHES MADE AND THEN THERE IS ALL THE MACHINERY OF CONVENTIONS AND ELECTIONS THE PANIC OF FOR INSTANCE RESULTED IN THE BRYAN MOVEMENT OF THAT MOVEMENT WAS A REVOLT OF THE DEBTOR CLASS IF IT HAD SUCCEEDED IT WOULD HAVE PRECIPITATED A PANIC AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MISFORTUNE FOR THE REASON THAT BOTH THE PEOPLE AND THEIR LEADERS WERE IGNORANT AND INSTEAD OF THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A SEVERE REACTION MARK HANNA WAS A CUNNING MAN BUT IF HE HAD BEEN STILL MORE CUNNING HE WOULD NEVER HAVE RAISED SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO BUY THE PRESIDENCY FOR WILLIAM MCKINLEYHE WOULD HAVE LET THE PEOPLE HAVE FREE SILVER AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE HAD THE PEOPLE WE CAME TO THE ELECTION OF ON THE CREST OF A PROSPERITY WAVE BUT PROSPERITY TOO TAKES ITS TIME TO BE REALISED AND SO HANNA TOOK THE PRECAUTION TO RAISE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND BUY THE ELECTION AGAIN AND THEN CAME WHICH I THINK WAS THE MOST INTERESTING ELECTION OF THEM ALL WITH THE POLITICIANS THE PROSPERITY BOOM STILL HELD SWAY MARK HANNA HAD ROOSEVELT ALL READY FOR THE SHELF AND THE OLDTIME STATERIGHTS DEMOCRATS AROSE AND BURIED MR BRYAN IN THE DEEPEST VAULT OF THEIR PARTY CATACOMBS BUT THEN CAME THE PEOPLEWITH THE COUNTRY TREMBLING ON THE VERGE OF ANOTHER HARD TIMES THEY GAVE PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT THE MOST TREMENDOUS MAJORITY EVER RECORDED IN AMERICA AND INCIDENTALLY AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH TO SHOW HOW THEY FELT THEY GAVE NEARLY HALF A MILLION VOTES TO EUGENE V DEBS FOOTNOTE FIGURES QUOTED EVIDENTLY UPON INSIDE INFORMATION BY THE WASHINGTON POST IN THIS ELECTION ACCORDING TO MY SCHEDULE CORRESPONDS WITH THE ELECTION OF IN THE CIVIL WAR CRISIS THE SAFE AND SANE DEMOCRACY WHICH RECEIVED ITS DEATHBLOW IN CORRESPONDS WITH THE OLD WHIG PARTY IT WILL PROBABLY MAKE INDEPENDENT NOMINATIONS IN AND EXACTLY AS DID THE WHIGS AND WILL RECEIVE THE VOTES OF ALL THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN DEALING WITH NEW CONDITIONS ACCORDING TO OLD FORMULAS IN THE MEANTIME THE REAL CONTESTANTS OF THE COMING CRISIS ARE FORMING THEIR LINES UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PARTY OF DISGUISED BUT UNRELENTING CONSERVATISM AND OUR PRESIDENTS IN AND WOULD HAVE BEEN EITHER FIGUREHEADS LIKE FAIRBANKS AND SHAW OR SHREWD BEGUILERS OF THE PEOPLE LIKE CANNON AND ROOT AS IT IS IT LOOKS NOW IF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT WERE TO REMAIN THE MASTER OF HIS PARTY IN WHICH CASE WE SHALL HAVE IN A MILD REFORMER LIKE TAFT OR POSSIBLY EVEN GOVERNOR HUGHES THE ONE THING CERTAIN IS THAT WHOEVER RECEIVES THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT IF IT IS A ROOSEVELT MAN THE PRESIDENTS PRESTIGE WILL ELECT HIM OR IF THE SYSTEM CONCLUDES TO HAVE ITS OWN WAY HE WILL BE PUT IN BY BRIBERY IN ANY CASE HE WILL GO IN AND IT IS BEST THAT HE SHOULD GO IN SO LONG AS WE ARE TO HAVE CAPITALISM IT IS PROPER THAT THE CAPITALIST SHOULD HAVE A FREE HAND PERSONALLY I SHOULD CONSIDER THE ELECTION OF A RADICAL IN A CALAMITY FOR HARD TIMES WILL BE JUST ABOUT TO BREAK AND I GREATLY DESIRE TO SEE CANNON AND ALDRICH AND THE REST OF THEM CAUGHT WITH THE GOODS ON WHO WILL BE THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WILL IT BE THE CHAMPION OF THE WESTERN FARMERS OR OF THE PROLETARIAT OF OUR EASTERN CITIES I DO NOT KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT IT WILL BE MR BRYAN AND I AM SORRY IN A WAY BECAUSE THAT WILL PUT HIM OUT OF THE RACE IN I CONCEIVED AN INTENSE ADMIRATION FOR MR BRYAN AFTER HIS LAST SPEECH IN NEW YORK CITY NEVER IN OUR HISTORY DID A PUBLIC MAN FACE A GREATER TEMPTATION THAN HE DID AFTER HIS TWO YEARS OF TRAVEL EVERYTHING IN THE COUNTRY SEEMED TO HAVE TURNED CONSERVATIVE AND THE MONEYPOWER FRIGHTENED BY ROOSEVELT WAS READY TO THROW ITSELF INTO HIS ARMS WHAT HE DID WAS TO TAKE HIS STAND UPON THE GREAT ISSUE OVER WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE NEXT SIX YEARS WILL BE FOUGHT OUTTHE NATIONALISATION OF THE RAILROADS AND IN DOING IT HE PLACED HIS NAME UPON THE ROLL OF OUR STATESMEN THE TYPE CHATTEL SLAVERY WAGE SLAVERY THE CONSERVATIVE DANIEL WEBSTER GROVER CLEVELAND REFORMER THE UNWILLING PROPHET JOHN C CALHOUN MARCUS A HANNA THE GREAT COMPROMISER HENRY CLAY THEODORE ROOSEVELT THE TIMID CONSERVATIVE EDWARD EVERETT ALTON B PARKER THE EDITOR OF HORACE GREELEY ARTHUR BRISBANE

REACTIONIST THE AGGRESSIVE JEFFERSON DAVIS NELSON W ALDRICH REACTIONIST THE ORGANISER OF WM LOWNDS YANCEY DAVID M PARRY REACTION THE LAST FIGUREHEAD JAMES BUCHANAN WILLIAM H TAFT THE UNTRIED HOPE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WM RANDOLPH HEARST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I WAS SKETCHING OUT MY COMPARISON OF THE CIVIL WAR CRISIS AND OUR OWN IN CONVERSATION WITH AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN WHO ASKED ME TO MAKE HIM A TABLE SHOWING THE PARALLEL BETWEEN THE MEN OF THE TWO PERIODS THIS TABLE WAS AFTERWARDS PUBLISHED IN THE INDEPENDENT WITH AN EXPLANATORY LETTER IN THE COURSE OF WHICH I POINTED OUT THAT ONE MUST NOT TAKE IT TOO LITERALLY OR LOOK FOR A RESEMBLANCE IN EXTERNAL DETAILS FOOTNOTE SEE TABLE ON PAGE IN THE COURSE OF ITS EDITORIAL COMMENT THE INDEPENDENT SUGGESTED ANOTHER PARALLEL THAT BETWEEN THE JUNGLE AND UNCLE TOMS CABIN AND THEN IT WENT ON TO EXPRESS ITS PERPLEXITY AT MY VENTURING TO COMPARE HEARST WITH LINCOLN THERE IS NO MAN IN OUR PUBLIC LIFE TODAY WHO INTERESTS ME SO MUCH AS WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST I HAVE BEEN WATCHING HIM FOR TEN YEARS DURING THE LAST HALFDOZEN OF THEM WEIGHING AND TESTING HIM AS THE MAN OF THE COMING HOUR I DO NOT SAY THAT HE WILL BE THE MAN ALL THAT I CAN SAY IS THAT HE STANDS THE BEST CHANCE OF BEING THE CANDIDATE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN AND THAT THE MAN WHO SECURES THAT NOMINATION WILL IF HE DOES HIS WORK AND FOR HIM TO FAIL TO DO IT IS ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE WRITE HIS NAME IN OUR HISTORY BESIDE THE NAMES OF WASHINGTON AND LINCOLN MR HEARST IS ONE OF THE BYPRODUCTS OF THE INDUSTRIAL PROCESSA MEMBER OF THE SECOND GENERATION YOU ARE TO PICTURE MANY THOUSANDS OF YOUNG MEN HEIRS OF THE ENORMOUS FORTUNES OF OUR CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY THEY ARE BROUGHT UP IN LUXURY AND IN COMPLETE IDLENESSTHE WORLD GIVES THEM CARTE BLANCHE WITH THE RESULT THAT AT AN EARLY AGE THEY ARE SATED WITH ALL THE ORDINARY PLEASURES OF HUMAN BEINGS AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAVE BIG HEALTHY BODIES AND THEY CRAVE EXCITEMENT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO COMPILE A LIST OF SOME OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE DONE OF COURSE A GREAT MANY SIMPLY FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THEIR FATHERS AND BECOME COMMERCIAL BUCCANEERS SOME DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO AUTOMOBILES AND RACEHORSES SOME TO SOCIETY AND GOSSIP SOME TO MERE BRUTAL DISSIPATIONSUCH AS THE SCIONS OF THE NOW EXTINCT LINE OF PULLMAN WHO USED TO SMASH UP THE SALOONS OF CHICAGO AND NOW AND THEN AMUSE THEMSELVES BY HURLING BRICKBATS THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THEIR FATHERS HOME NOW AND THEN THERE IS ONE WHO GOES IN FOR BIG GAME OR FOR MONKEYDINNERS OR FOR SUNDAYSCHOOLS OR FOR SOCIALISM OR FOR FLYINGMACHINES AND THERE WAS ONE WHO WENT IN FOR NEWSPAPERS HIS FATHER WAS RELUCTANT TO HUMOUR THE WHIMHE THOUGHT THAT A MILLION DOLLAR RACINGSTABLE WOULD COST LESS IN THE END THAN A FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR NEWSPAPER WHICH OF COURSE PUT THE YOUNG MAN UPON HIS METTLEMADE HIM SET OUT TO MAKE THE PAPER PAY AND SHOW THE OLD MAN TO MAKE IT PAY HE HAD TO GET CIRCULATION AND TO GET CIRCULATION HE HAD TO GET SOMETHING NEWTHERE WAS NO USE DOING THINGS LIKE THE OLD NEWSPAPERS WHICH WERE NOT PAYING BUT HAD TO BE FUNDED BY THE POLITICAL POWERS WHICH USED THEM SO ONCE MORE YOU SEE CAPITAL AS I HAVE PICTURED ITLIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE PACING ABOUT WATCHING FOR AN OPENING HERE AND THERE AND WHERE IS THE OPENING WHY THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WHOM THE MERCILESS MACHINERY OF EXPLOITATION BEATS DOWN AND TRAMPLES UPON AND PUSHES OUT OF THE WAY AND FORGETS THEY ARE BRUTALISED AND IGNORANT THEY ARE STUPID WITH TOILBUT YET THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS THEY CRAVE LIFE THEY NEVER READ NEWSPAPERSBUT GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT AND THEY WILL LEARN TO READ GIVE THEM BIG HEADLINES AND A SHOCK ON EVERY PAGE GIVE THEM ROYALTY AND HIGH LIFE SCANDAL AND SPICE BATTLE MURDER AND SUDDEN DEATHAND THEN THEY WILL BUY YOUR PAPER IT WAS GOOD FUN FOR MR HEARST TO DO THIS WATCHING HIS NEWSPAPERS WHAT HAS STRUCK ME MOST IS THE SHEER AUDACITY OF THEM AUDACITY IS HIS CHARACTERISTIC QUALITY AND IT IS A CHARACTERISTIC AMERICAN QUALITYIT PLACES HIM AMONG OUR NATIONAL TREASURES ALONG WITH MARK TWAIN AND P T BARNUM AND BUFFALO BILL AND THE MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOATS WITH THE NIGGER ON THE SAFETYVALVE I AM TOLD BY FRIENDS OF MR HEARST THAT HIS INSTINCT FROM THE START WAS FOR DEMOCRACY IF SO SO MUCH THE BETTER BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO MY HYPOTHESIS A NEWSPAPER HAS TO HAVE EDITORIAL OPINIONS AND THEY HAD BEST BE OPINIONS THAT PLEASE ITS READERS IF WE ARE TO PUBLISH A PAPER FOR THE MASSES TO READ WE MUST ALSO VOICE THE HOPES AND THE LONGINGS OF THE MASSES SO MR HEARST TURNED TRAITOR TO HIS CLASS HE SEEMS TO HAVE DONE THIS INSTINCTIVELY AND WITHOUT PANGS I FIND WHAT IS VERY SINGULAR AND STRIKING THAT THE MEMBERS OF HIS OWN CLASS HATE HIM NOT ONLY PUBLICLY BUT PERSONALLY IT SEEMS TO HAVE PLEASED HIM TO DEFY ALL THEIR CONVENTIONS I WAS TOLD FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO NEW YORK HE MADE HIMSELF A SCANDAL IN THE TENDERLOIN I WAS PERPLEXED ABOUT THAT FOR THE MEMBERS OF OUR SECOND GENERATION ARE GENERALLY WELL KNOWN IN THE TENDERLOIN AND NOBODY CALLS IT A SCANDAL BUT ONE YOUNG SOCIETY MAN WHO HAD KNOWN HEARST WELL GAVE ME THE REASONAND HE SPOKE WITH REAL GRAVITY IT WASNT WHAT HE DIDWE ALL DO IT BUT IT WAS THE WAY HE DID HE DIDNT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO HIDE WHAT HE DID I HAVE MADE CLEAR IN THIS BOOK MY BELIEF THAT THE MASSES ARE DRIVEN TO REVOLT BY THE PRESSURE OF STERN AND RUTHLESS ECONOMIC FORCE THEY WERE IGNORANT AND HELPLESS AND AMONG OUR MEN OF WEALTH AND POWER THERE WAS NO ONE TO HELP THEMTHERE WAS NO ONE AMONG ALL OUR INTELLECTUAL LEADERS TO VOICE THEIR WRONGS THEY WERE LEFT TO HELP THEMSELVESSO WHAT MORE NATURAL THAN THAT IT SHOULD OCCUR TO SOME ENTERPRISING YOUNG MILLIONAIRE TO LEAP INTO THE BREACH THERE WAS ENDLESS EXCITEMENT AND NOTORIETY TO BE WONAND AT THE END PERHAPS POWER OF A NEW AND QUITE INCREDIBLE SORT YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT I AM TAKING DELIBERATELY THE LOWEST POSSIBLE VIEW I AM DEALING WITH MATERIAL CONDITIONS AND PICTURING A MATERIAL REMEDY FOR THEM MY POINT IS THAT WHATEVER HE MAY BE PERSONALLY MR HEARST IS MORTGAGED BODY AND SOUL TO THE COURSE TO WHICH HE HAS GIVEN HIMSELF NOT ONLY HIS PUBLIC REPUTATION BUT HIS ENTIRE FORTUNE IS IN HIS NEWSPAPERS AND THE PUBLIC IS THE MASTER OF HIS NEWSPAPERS HE HAS CONJURED A STORM WHICH HE CANNOT POSSIBLY CONTROLHE MUST PLAY OUT TO THE END THE PART HE HAS CHOSEN IT IS VERY CURIOUS TO OBSERVE HOW HIS RLE HAS TAKEN HOLD OF HIM AND CHANGED HIM I AM TOLD THAT WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO NEW YORK HE WORE CHECKED TROUSERS AND FANCY TIES AND NOW HE WEARS THE TRADITIONAL SOFT HAT AND FROCK COAT OF OUR STATESMEN AND ALSO I THINK THE RLE HAS CHANGED HIS CHARACTER FOR THIS STRUGGLE IS A REAL ONE IT IS A STRUGGLE OF THE PEOPLE FOR LIFE THE CAUSE IS A CAUSE OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND THE MAN DOES NOT LIVE WHO CAN DO BATTLE FOR IT AS MR HEARST HAS DONE AND NOT COME TO TAKE FIRE WITH THE PASSION OF IT THE MAN DOES NOT LIVE WHO CAN MAKE THE ENEMIES MR HEARST HAS MADE AND NOT TAKE A REAL AND VITAL INTEREST IN THE TASK OF BRINGING THEM TO THEIR KNEES I BELIEVE THAT MR HEARST IS TODAY AS SINCERE A MAN AS WE HAVE IN POLITICAL LIFE IT MAY BE OF COURSE THAT SOME ONE ELSE WILL GET THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION IN THAT MATTERS NOT AT ALL IN MY THESISTHE ONE THING CERTAIN IS THAT IT WILL BE SOME MAN WHO STANDS PLEDGED TO PUT AN END TO CLASSGOVERNMENT FOLLOWING IT THERE WILL BE A CAMPAIGN OF AN INTENSITY OF FURY SUCH AS THIS COUNTRY HAS NEVER BEFORE WITNESSED IN ITS HISTORY LET US OUTLINE IN A FEW WORDS THE SITUATION AS IT WILL THEN EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE WILL BE TWO OR THREE MILLIONPERHAPS FIVE OR TEN MILLIONMEN OUT OF WORK THEY WILL HAVE BEEN OUT FOR A YEAR OR TWO AND HAVE HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO WORK UP EXCITEMENT THEY MAY HAVE FORCED CONGRESS TO PROVIDE THEM SOME TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENTWHICH WILL OF COURSE BE THE FIRST TASTE OF BLOOD TO THE TIGER THEY WILL CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN WAGING STRIKES OF A VIOLENCE NEVER BEFORE KNOWNTHEY WILL HAVE BEEN SHOT DOWN IN GREAT NUMBERS AND THEY MAY HAVE DONE A GREAT DEAL OF BURNING AND DYNAMITING THAT SOME PARTICULARLY CONSPICUOUS INDIVIDUAL LIKE MR ROCKEFELLER OR MR BAER MAY HAVE BEEN ASSASSINATED SEEMS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT A COXEYS ARMY OF MUCH LARGER SIZE WILL HAVE MARCHED ON WASHINGTON SEEMS QUITE CERTAIN WHEN I WAS IN CHICAGO JUST AFTER THE LAST BEEF STRIKE I MET HALF A DOZEN LABOUR LEADERS WHO TOLD ME AN INTERESTING STORY CHICAGO HAS THE MOST THOROUGHLY REVOLUTIONARY WORKINGCLASS OF ANY CITY IN THE COUNTRY AND TOWARDS THE END OF THIS STRIKE THEY WERE DEEPLY STIRRED AND THERE HAD BEEN SEVERAL CONFERENCES IN WHICH A COMPLETE PROGRAM HAD BEEN LAID OUT FOR AN ANTIRENT STRIKE ON A CERTAIN DAY ALL THE WORKING PEOPLE OF CHICAGO WERE TO REFUSE TO PAY RENT UNTIL THE MEATPACKERS GAVE IN THE PROJECT WAS NIPPED BY THE SETTLEMENT OF THE STRIKE BUT IT ONLY WAITS A NEW OCCASION TO BE PUT INTO EFFECT BY THE TIME WHICH WE ARE PICTURING HERE IT WILL QUITE CERTAINLY HAVE SPREAD EAST AND WEST TO THE TWO OCEANS SO THAT NOT HALF OUR CITY POPULATION WILL BE PAYING ANY RENT FOR THEIR HOMES AT THIS TIME ILLUSTRATION COPYRIGHT LESLIES WEEKLY ILLUSTRATION COPYRIGHT LESLIES WEEKLY COXEYS ARMY ON THE MARCH AND IN WASHINGTON AND ALSO OF COURSE THERE WILL HAVE BEEN PROCESSIONS IN THE STREETS AND UNEMPLOYED DEMONSTRATIONS EVERY DAY THERE WILL BE A SOCIALIST MEETING ROUND EVERY CORNERALL THROUGH THIS PERIOD OF STRESS YOU ARE TO PICTURE THE SOCIALISTS WORKING LIKE BEES AT SWARMING TIME THAT IS THE FUNCTION OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY ALL THROUGH THIS CRISIS TO STIR UP AND ORGANISE THE PROLETARIAT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT IN THE CRISIS THE PEOPLE ARE NOT IGNORANT OF THE WAY THEY WILL BE HEADING THE HUNGERPARADES CARRYING THE BANNERS AND MAKING THE SPEECHES CIRCULATING TRACTS AND FIVEMILLIONCOPY EDITIONS OF THE APPEAL TO REASON THEY WILL BE POLLING UNHEARD OF VOTESIN ONE OR TWO CITIES THEY WILL BE CARRYING THE ELECTIONS AND SOCIALIST MAYORS WILL BE CONFISCATING STREETRAILROADS AND CLAPPING OBSTRUCTIVE JUDGES INTO JAIL THE SOCIALIST PARTY IS A PARTY OF AGITATION RATHER THAN ADMINISTRATION BUT IT IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE THAT IT SHOULD EVERYWHERE EXIST AS A PARTY OF THE LAST RESORT A CLUB HELD OVER SOCIETY EVERYWHERE THE CRY WILL BE DO THIS AND DO THAT OR THE SOCIALISTS WILL CARRY THE COUNTRY SO WILL BE USHERED IN THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND THE DEATHGRAPPLE YOU WILL TRY TO BEAT THE PEOPLE BACK AS YOU HAVE DONE BEFOREBUT YOU WILL NOT SUCCEED THIS TIME BEFORE THIS THE PEOPLE WERE IGNORANTBUT NOW THEY WILL KNOW THEY WILL HAVE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FESTERING ULCER OF COMMERCIALISM LAID OPEN BEFORE THEIR EYES YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BLAME IT ON THE LABOUR UNIONS NOR ON THE RATE BILL NOR ON ROOSEVELT NOR ON THE NEGRO NOR ON THE ESQUIMAU YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AWE THE PEOPLE WITH ANY GREAT NAMES NOR TO FOOL THEM WITH RESPECTABILITY THEY WILL HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO REGARD THE LEADERS OF OUR BUSINESS AFFAIRS AS CONVICTED AND UNPUNISHED CRIMINALS AND IF YOU WERE TO PROPOSE SUCH A THING AS A BUSINESS MANS PARADE YOU WOULD BE GREETED WITH A SCREAM OF FURY YOU WILL BE UTTERLY TERRIFIED AT THE STATE OF AFFAIRS CREDIT WILL BE FAILING AND THE BUSINESS OF THE COUNTRY WILL BE HOLDING ITS BREATH YOU WILL SUBSCRIBE A CAMPAIGN FUND OF TENFIFTEENTWENTY MILLIONS OF DOLLARSBUT THERE WILL BE MR HEARST WITH HIS EXTRAS IN A DOZEN CITIES AND HIS TWENTY MILLION FREE COPIES A DAY AND HE WILL TELL HOW MUCH YOU ARE RAISING AND A WHOLE LOT MORE SO THERE WILL BE COMMITTEES OF SAFETY TO GUARD THE BALLOTAND A FEW MORE GOOD CAMPAIGN CRIES THERE WILL BE FRENZIED CONFERENCES AMONG OUR POLITICAL MILLIONAIRES AND A WEEK OR TWO BEFORE ELECTION DAY MR HEARSTS OPPONENTQUITE PROBABLY EXPRESIDENT ROOSEVELTWILL COME OUT FAVOURING NEARLY ALL OF HIS RADICAL PROPOSALS BUT DECLARING THAT THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE CARRIED INTO EFFECT BY A SOCIALIST LIKE MR HEARST MR HEARST WILL REPLY WITH HIS TEN THOUSAND AND TENTH DECLARATION THAT HE IS NOT A SOCIALIST AND HAS NO SYMPATHY WITH SOCIALISMA STATEMENT WHICH THE SOCIALISTS WHO WILL NOT UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST THE MEANING OF EVENTS WILL CORDIALLY SUBSTANTIATE MR HEARST WILL DECLARE THAT HE STANDS UPON A PLATFORM OF AMERICANISM AND THAT HE SEEKS ONLY EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALLAND THEREFORE FEDERAL OWNERSHIP OF ALL CRIMINAL MONOPOLIES SO ELECTION DAY WILL COME AND MR HEARST WILL BE ELECTED AND WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK THE BUSINESS OF THE COUNTRY WILL HAVE FALLEN INTO HEAPS BANKS WILL HAVE CLOSED MILLS WILL BE IDLETHERE WILL BE NO FREIGHT AND RAILROADS WILL BE FAILING THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK WILL BE REMINDED THAT IF THE RAILROADS STOP THE CITY WILL STARVE TO DEATH IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND SO PERHAPS EVEN BEFORE MR HEARST TAKES OFFICE GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF THE RAILROADS WILL BE REALISED HOW WILL IT BE ACCOMPLISHED IT IS A CHARMINGLY SIMPLE PROCESSI COULD DO IT ALL MYSELF HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THE INSIDE STORY OF HOW THE LAST COAL STRIKE WAS SETTLED THE OPERATORS WERE STANDING UPON THEIR RIGHTS AS THE PERSONS TO WHOM GOD IN HIS INFINITE WISDOM HAD ENTRUSTED THE CARE OF THE PROPERTY INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY AND ALL WINTER LONG THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN LACKING COAL THEN SUDDENLY PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT WHO IS A MASTER OF THE ART OF FEELING THE PUBLIC PULSE MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF COAL MINES WAS ABOUT TO CRYSTALLISE INTO AN ISSUE OF PRACTICAL POLITICS SO HE SENT SECRETARY ROOT TO SEE MORGAN AND TELL HIM THAT THE COAL OPERATORS MUST GIVE IN MORGAN SAW THE OPERATORS AND THEY INSISTED UPON THEIR RIGHTS AND SO ROOT WENT BACK TO WASHINGTON AND CAME AGAIN TO SAY THAT AS MR MORGAN WELL KNEW THE COAL ROADS WERE DOING BUSINESS IN FLAT VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND THAT UNLESS WITHIN TWENTYFOUR HOURS THEY GAVE THEIR CONSENT TO THE APPOINTMENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF A BOARD OF ARBITRATION THE WHOLE POWER OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE WOULD BE TURNED UPON AN INVESTIGATION OF THEIR BUSINESS METHODS AND SO THE STRIKE WAS SETTLED IN A DAY AND IN VERY SIMILAR WAYS WILL THE FUTURE PROBLEMS BE SETTLED THERE WILL BE SIMILAR CONFERENCES AND THEN SOME FINE DAY A DULYACCREDITED COMMISSIONER FROM THE PRESIDENT WILL TRAVEL SAY TO PHILADELPHIA AND ENTER THE OFFICES OF THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD ARCHCORRUPTER OF THE GREAT KEYSTONE STATE THE DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY WILL RECEIVE HIM WITH BOWS AND SMILES AND WILL SPREAD THEIR BOOKS BEFORE HIM AND HIS STAFF AND PLACE THEMSELVES AND THEIR OFFICE AT HIS DISPOSAL HE WILL HEAR A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE SITUATION AND WILL THEN GIVE HIS ORDERS TO THE PRESIDENT AND OTHER OFFICIALS OF THE ROAD TO THE EFFECT THAT SCHEDULES ARE TO BE CONTINUED AS PREVIOUSLY THAT ALL SALARIES WILL REMAIN UNALTERED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE AND THAT PASSENGER AND FREIGHT RATES ARE TO BE DROPPED TO A POINT WHERE NET PROFITS WILL BE WIPED OUT THEN HE WILL SHAKE HANDS WITH THE DIRECTORS AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR SERVICES IN BUILDING UP THE ROAD ADDING THAT THEIR SERVICES ARE NOW AT AN END AND THAT FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES WILL BE THE APPLICATION OF SOCIALISM TO THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD BUT YOU SAY BY MY HYPOTHESIS THE ROAD COULD NOT RUN HOW WILL IT BE ABLE TO RUN NOW THE REASON IT COULDNT RUN BEFORE WAS THAT THERE WERE NO PROFITS BUT NOW IT WILL NOT BE RUN FOR PROFITS BUT FOR SERVICE LIKE THE POST OFFICE TO HELP IT OVER ITS MOMENTARY EMBARRASSMENT OF COURSE THE CREDIT OF THE GOVERNMENT MAY BE NEEDED BUT EVEN THAT IS NOT LIKELY FOR EXACTLY THE SAME THING WHICH HAPPENS TO THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD WILL BE HAPPENING TO THE STEEL TRUST AND THE OIL TRUST AND THE COAL TRUST AND THE BEEF TRUST AND ALL THESE INDUSTRIES WILL BE STARTING INTO ACTIVITY AND SO THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF FREIGHT WITH THE CAPTAINS OF EACH OF THESE TRUSTS THERE WILL HAVE BEEN SECRET PRESIDENTIAL CONFERENCES AT WHICH THESE GENTLEMEN WILL HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SINCE THEY CAN NO LONGER RUN THEIR BUSINESS THEY MUST ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE POSSESSION AND RUN ITTHE PRICE TO BE PAID FOR THEIR STOCK BEING A MATTER FOR FUTURE NEGOTIATION AND A MATTER OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THEM IN ANY CASE BECAUSE OF THE INCOME AND INHERITANCE TAX LAWS JUST THEN BEING RUSHED THROUGH CONGRESS SUCH WILL BE THE REVOLUTIONAND THE GATEWAY INTO THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC PRECISELY AS IN FRANCE WE SAW THAT THE PEASANT WHO WAS STARVING BECAUSE HE COULD NOT PAY HIS TAXES BEGAN TO TILL THE LAND AND GROW RICH WITHOUT ANY TAXES SO IN THE MIDST OF UNIVERSAL DESTITUTION IT WILL SUDDENLY BE DISCOVERED THAT THE FARMER WHO COULD NOT SELL HIS GRAIN AND THEREFORE HAD NO HAT TO WEAR MAY NOW EXCHANGE HIS GRAIN WITH THE OPERATIVE IN THE HAT FACTORY WHO HAD PRODUCED SO MANY HATS FOR HIS MASTER THAT HE WAS HIMSELF OUT OF A JOB AND COULD NOT GET ANY BREAD AND ALL THE COTTON MILLS WHICH WERE SHUT BECAUSE WE COULD NO LONGER SELL SHIRTS TO THE CHINAMEN WILL NOW START MERRILY TO WORK MAKING SHIRTS FOR ALL THE SHIRTLESS WRETCHES THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF AMERICA AND THE SHOE OPERATIVES OF MASSACHUSETTS WHO WERE MAKING SHOES FOR THE FILIPINOS WHICH THE POOR FILIPINOS HAD TO BE FORCED AT THE POINT OF THE BAYONET TO BUY WILL BEGIN MAKING SHOES FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN AND FOR THE UNHAPPY PEOPLE OF THE TENEMENTS WHO WERE BEFORE GOING BAREFOOTED AND THE STEEL TRUST WILL SUDDENLY LEAP INTO ACTION BECAUSE THOSE MISERYSMITTEN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES IN THE DARK ROOMS OF THE NEW YORK CITY TENEMENTS WILL NOW EARN MONEY TO BUILD THEMSELVES DECENT HABITATIONS AND THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS WHO ARE NOW BEING GROUND UP IN THE GLASS FACTORIES OF NEW JERSEY AND THE COTTON MILLS OF GEORGIA AND THE COAL MINES OF PENNSYLVANIA WILL COME OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT AND PLAY WHILE THEIR PARENTS ARE BUILDING SCHOOLS TO WHICH THEY CAN BE SENT AND THE YOUNG GIRL WHO STANDS SHUDDERING ON THE BRINK OF PROSTITUTION WORKING TEN HOURS A DAY IN AN EAST SIDE SWEATSHOP FOR A WAGE OF FORTY CENTS A WEEK WILL RECEIVE THE FULL VALUE OF HER PRODUCT AND BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN HERSELF BY TWO HOURS OF WORK A DAY I KNOW WHAT IS THE ATTITUDE OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION TOWARDS A CUREALL AND YET IT IS BUT THE SOBER TRUTH THAT FOR NEARLY EVERY EVIL THAT TROUBLES OUR AGE THERE IS ONE REMEDY AND ONLY ONETHE DEMOCRATISATION OF OUR INDUSTRY IF YOU WERE TO TAKE A GROWING BOY AND RIVET AN IRON BAND ABOUT HIS CHEST THERE WOULD COME SOONER OR LATER A TIME WHEN THE BOY WOULD SHOW SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESSAND FOR EVERY SYMPTOM THERE WOULD BE BUT ONE REMEDY IS THE BOY CROSS AND COMPLAINING BREAK THE BAND IS HE PALE AND SICKLY BREAK THE BAND DOES HE GASP AND CRY OUT BREAK THE BAND DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT IN THE MONARCHY OF FRANCE IN THE YEAR A MAN WHO SET OUT TO FIND A REMEDY FOR THIS OR THAT EVIL OF THE HOUR WOULD HAVE FOUND BUT ONE REMEDY FOR ALL OF THEMTHE OVERTHROWING OF THE ARISTOCRACY AND SIMILARLY ALL THE DISEASES OF THIS PERIOD WHICH ARE THE DESPAIR OF THE MORALIST AND THE PATRIOT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FACT THAT OUR SOCIETY IS GASPING IN A LAST DESPERATE AGONY OF EFFORT TO MAINTAIN ITS SYSTEM OF COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY WE ARE LIKE A MAN RUNNING ON A RAILROAD TRACK PURSUED BY A TRAIN THE TRAIN IS INCREASING ITS SPEED AND DO WHAT HE WILL IT GAINS UPON HIM HE CRIES OUT HE GASPS FOR BREATH HE IS AGONISED WILD WITH TERROR MAKING HIS LAST LEAP WITH THE ENGINE AT HIS VERY HEELSAND THEN SUDDENLY IT OCCURS TO HIM TO LEAP TO ONE SIDE AND SO THE TRAIN FLASHES BY AND HE SITS DOWN AND MOPS HIS BROW AND THINKS HOW VERY STUPID IT WAS OF HIM CHAPTER VII THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC AND NOW LET US IMAGINE THAT SOCIETY HAS ABOLISHED EXPLOITATION AND THE COMPETITIVE WAGESYSTEM AND GOT ITS BREATH AND FOUND LEISURE TO EXAMINE ITSELF UNDER THE NEW RGIME HOW WILL IT FIND THINGS PROCEEDING ONE OF THE FIRST OBJECTIONS THAT YOU WILL RUN UP AGAINST IF EVER YOU START OUT TO AGITATE SOCIALISM IS YOUR LACK OF DEFINITENESS GIVE US YOUR PROGRAM PEOPLE WILL SAYWE WANT TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF A WORLD YOU EXPECT TO MAKE AND HOW YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE IT AND THEY WILL GROW ANGRY WHEN THEY FIND THAT YOU HAVE NOT A CUTANDDRIED SCHEME OF SOCIETY IN YOUR POCKETTHAT YOU HAVE STIRRED THEM UP ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND YET THAT IS JUST WHAT YOU HAVE TO GO ON DOING THERE USED TO BE UTOPIAN SOCIALISTSPLATO WAS THE FIRST OF THEM AND BELLAMY WAS THE LASTWHO KNEW THE COMING WORLD FROM ITS PRESIDENTS TO ITS CHIMNEYSWEEPS WHO COULD TELL YOU THE VERY COLOUR OF ITS POSTAGESTAMPS BUT NOWADAYS ALL SOCIALISTS ARE SCIENTIFIC THEY SAY THAT SOCIAL CHANGES ARE THE PRODUCT OF THE INTERACTION OF INNUMERABLE FORCES AND CANNOT BE DEFINITELY FORETOLD THEY SAY THAT THE NEW ORGANISM WILL BE THE RESULT OF THE STRIVINGS OF MILLIONS OF MEN ACTED UPON BY VARIOUS MOTIVES IDEALS PREJUDICES AND FEARS AND SO THEY CALL THEMSELVES NO LONGER BUILDERS OF SYSTEMS BUT PREACHERS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS THEIR ANSWER TO OBJECTORS IS THAT I ONCE HEARD GIVEN BY HANFORD RECENT CANDIDATE FOR VICEPRESIDENT ON THE SOCIALIST TICKET TO A LAWYER WITH WHOM HE WAS DEBATING DO YOU ASK FOR A MAP OF HEAVEN BEFORE YOU JOIN THE CHURCH THIS MUCH WE MAY SAY HOWEVER THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC WILL BE AN INDUSTRIAL GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE EXACTLY AS POLITICAL SOVEREIGNTY IS THE PROPERTY OF THE COMMUNITY SO WILL IT BE WITH INDUSTRIAL SOVEREIGNTYTHAT IS CAPITAL IT WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND ITS EQUAL BENEFITS WILL BE THE ELEMENTAL RIGHT OF EVERY CITIZEN THE OFFICIALS MAY BE OUR PRESIDENTS AND GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATURES OR THEY MAY BE AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE GOVERNING BODY CORRESPONDING TO OUR PRESENT DIRECTORS AND PRESIDENTS OF CORPORATIONS IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE REVOLUTION IS ONE OF VIOLENCE THEY WILL PROBABLY BE TRADEUNION COMMITTEES THE GOVERNING POWER MAY BE CHOSEN SEPARATELY IN EACH TRADE AND INDUSTRY BY THOSE WHO WORK IN IT JUST AS THE OFFICIALS OF A PARTY ARE NOW CHOSEN BY THOSE WHO VOTE IN IT OR THEY MAY BE APPOINTED AS OUR POSTMASTERS AND COLONIAL GOVERNORS ARE APPOINTED BY SOME CENTRAL AUTHORITY PERHAPS BY THE PRESIDENT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE FOR THE COLLECTIVE WISDOM OF THE COUNTRY TO DECIDE WHEN THE TIME COMES MEANWHILE IT IS ONLY SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE WILL BE AS LITTLE CHANGE AS POSSIBLE IN THE BUSINESS METHODS OF THE COUNTRYAND SO LITTLE THAT THE MAN WHO SHOULD COME BACK AND LOOK AT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW THAT ANY CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE I HAVE HEARD A DISTINGUISHED REPUBLICAN ORATOR POKING FUN AT SOCIALISM IN A PUBLIC ADDRESS PICTURE WOMEN DISPUTING IN THE PUBLIC WAREHOUSES AS TO WHETHER EACH HAD HAD HER FAIR SHARE OF SHOES AND FISH IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC THE WORKINGMAN WILL GO TO THE FACTORY WILL WORK UNDER THE DIRECTION OF HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER AND WILL RECEIVE HIS WAGES AT THE END OF THE WEEK IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS TODAY HE WILL SPEND HIS MONEY EXACTLY AS HE SPENDS IT TODAYHE WILL GO TO A STORE AND IF HE GETS A PAIR OF SHOES HE WILL PAY FOR THEM THE FARMER WILL TILL HIS LAND EXACTLY AS HE DOES TODAY AND WHEN HE TAKES HIS GRAIN TO MARKET HE WILL BE PAID FOR IT IN MONEY AND WILL PUT IT IN THE BANK AND WILL DRAW A CHECK UPON IT TO PAY FOR THE SUIT OF CLOTHES HE HAS ORDERED BY EXPRESS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN ALL THESE VARIOUS OPERATIONS WILL BE THAT THE FACTORIES WILL BE PUBLIC PROPERTY AND THE WAGES THE FULL VALUE OF THE PRODUCT WITH NO DEDUCTIONS FOR DIVIDENDS ON STOCK AND THAT THE STREET CARS THE BANKS AND THE STORES WILL BE PUBLIC UTILITIES MANAGED EXACTLY AS OUR POST OFFICE IS MANAGED CHARGING WHAT THE SERVICE COSTS AND MAKING NO PROFITS IN THE YEAR THE U S STEEL CORPORATION PAID ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYFIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND EMPLOYED ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYFIVE THOUSAND MEN UNDER SOCIALISM THE WAGES OF EACH EMPLOYEE OF THE U S STEEL CORPORATION WOULD THEREFORE BE INCREASED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PER CENT IN THE SAME WAY THE WAGES OF AN EMPLOYEE OF THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY WOULD BE INCREASED FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS FROM EIGHT TO TEN HUNDRED PER CENT THE FARE UPON THE GOVERNMENTOWNED STREET RAILROADS IN THE CITY OF BERLIN IS TWO AND A HALF CENTS WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT OUR WORKINGMANS CARFARE BILL WOULD BE CUT BY FIFTY PER CENT THE TOLL OF THE GOVERNMENTOWNED TELEPHONE OF SWEDEN IS THREE CENTS WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT THE WORKINGMANS TELEPHONE BILL WOULD BE CUT SEVENTY PER CENT THE ELIMINATION OF THE SPECULATOR AND THE HIGHER PIRACY OF WALL STREET WOULD RAISE THE PRICE OF THE FARMERS GRAIN BY FIFTY PER CENT THE ELIMINATION OF THE MILLERS TRUST AND THE RAILROAD TRUST WOULD LOWER THE PRICE OF BREAD BY AN EQUAL SUM THE ELIMINATION OF THE TARIFF ON WOOL OF THE SWEATER AND THE JOBBER THE DEPARTMENT STORE AND THE EXPRESS TRUST WOULD PROBABLY LOWER THE PRICE OF THE FARMERS SUIT OF CLOTHES SIXTY PER CENT THE ELIMINATION OF THE SWEATSHOP AND THE SLUM MIGHT RAISE IT TO ITS ORIGINAL LEVEL WHILE DECREASING THE FARMERS DOCTORS BILLS CORRESPONDINGLY OF COURSE I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT THE GAINS FROM THE ABOLITION OF EXPLOITATION WILL BE DISTRIBUTED IN EXACTLY THE RATIOS OUTLINED ABOVE THEY WILL BE DISTRIBUTED SO AS TO EQUALISE THE REWARDS OF LABOUR THE POINT IS THAT THERE WILL BE A SAVING AT EVERY POINTBECAUSE AT EVERY POINT THERE IS EXPLOITATION I HAVE SKETCHED IN THE JUNGLE CHAPTER A FEW OF THE SOCIAL SAVINGS INCIDENTAL TO THE ABOLITION OF COMPETITION THE READER WHO CARES FOR A THOROUGH AND SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THE SUBJECT IS REFERRED TO A RECENTLY PUBLISHED BOOK THE COST OF COMPETITION BY SIDNEY A REEVE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF PROFESSOR REEVE UNTIL HIS PUBLISHERS SENT ME HIS BOOK THEY SAY THAT HE WORKED ON IT FOR SEVEN YEARS AND WHEN I READ IT I COUNTED MYSELF THAT MANY YEARS TO THE GOOD FOR I HAD MEANT TO TRY TO DO THE TASK MYSELF PROFESSOR REEVE HAS DONE IT IN A WAY WHICH LEAVES NOT A WORD TO BE SAID IT IS A MARVELLOUS ANALYSIS OF THE WHOLE OF OUR PRESENT PRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND BEST OF ALL IT IS FREE FROM THE JARGON OF THE SCHOOLSIT IS THE WORK OF A MAN WHO HAS KEPT IN TOUCH WITH ACTUAL LIFE AND HAS MORAL FEELING AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC TRAINING PROFESSOR REEVE ANALYSES NOT MERELY THE ECONOMIC COSTS OF COMPETITION BUT ALSO THE ETHICAL COSTS WHICH AFTER ALL ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THE DIFFERENCE TO THE WORKINGMAN WILL BE NOT MERELY THAT HIS WAGES WILL BE SEVERAL TIMES AS GREAT BUT THAT HE HIMSELF WILL NO LONGER BE A WAGESLAVE OBLIGED TO SERVE ANOTHER MAN FOR HIS BREAD TO CRINGE AND GROVEL FOR A A JOB TO TOIL ALL DAY FOR ANOTHER MANS PROFIT AND SAVE UP HIS LITTLE HOARD AND LIVE IN DREAD OF THE NEXT WAGE REDUCTION THE NEXT STRIKE OR THE NEXT CLOSING DOWN OF THE FACTORY HE WILL BE A FREE AND INDEPENDENT MEMBER OF A COPERATIVE STATE HE WILL BE DELIVERED FROM THE NECESSITY OF GETTING THE BETTER OF HIS NEIGHBOUR BECAUSE HIS NEIGHBOUR WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO GET THE BETTER OF HIM HE WILL BE CERTAIN OF PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT POSSIBILITY OF LOSS OR FAILURE OF PAYMENTCERTAIN THAT SO LONG AS HE WORKS HE WILL RECEIVE JUST WHAT HE PRODUCES THAT IN CASE OF ACCIDENT OR OLD AGE HE WILL BE MAINTAINED AND THAT IN CASE OF DEATH HIS CHILDREN WILL BE CARED FOR AND BROUGHT UP TO BECOME COPERATIVE PARTNERS IN THE GREAT INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC ILLUSTRATION FROM THE COST OF COMPETITION THE COOPERATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION THE CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY ILLUSTRATION FROM THE COST OF COMPETITION THE COMPETITIVE DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION HOW YOU ASK COULD SOCIALISM GUARANTEE EVERY MAN PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT COULD THERE NOT BE OVERPRODUCTION UNDER SOCIALISM THERE COULD NOT THE SURPLUS PRODUCT BEING THE PROPERTY OF THE MAN WHO HAD PRODUCED IT AND NOT AS NOW THE PROPERTY OF SOME OTHER MAN IN A CASE OF OVERPRODUCTION THE WORKINGMAN WOULD BE NOT OUT OF WORK BUT ON A VACATION AS A MATTER OF FACT ONLY A REASONABLE SURPLUS WOULD BE PRODUCED BECAUSE THE WORKINGMAN WOULD STOP WHEN HE HAD PRODUCED WHAT HE WANTEDJUST AS YOU STOP EATING WHEN YOU HAVE SATISFIED YOUR HUNGER IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC THERE WILL BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER A CABINET OFFICIAL WITH A BUREAU OF CLERKS WHOSE TASK IT WILL BE TO REGISTER THE DECREES OF THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND IT IS FOUND LET US ASSUME THAT THE AMOUNT OF COAL NEEDED BY THE COMMUNITY IS REPRESENTED BY THE LABOUR OF TWO MILLION MEN FIVE DAYS IN THE WEEK AND SIX HOURS A DAY THE NUMBER OF SHOES IS REPRESENTED BY THE LABOUR OF HALF A MILLION MEN THE SAME TIME THE WAGES IN EACH TRADE ARE TEN DOLLARS A DAY AND AT THIS RATE IT IS FOUND THAT TWO MILLION MEN GO TO THE SHOE FACTORIES TO WORK AND ONLY HALF A MILLION TO THE COAL MINES THE WAGES OF COAL MINING ARE THEREFORE MADE TWELVE DOLLARS AND THE WAGES OF SHOEMAKING EIGHT DOLLARS IF THE BALANCE STILL DOES NOT ADJUST ITSELF IT WILL AT THE RATE OF THIRTEEN TO SEVEN OR FOURTEEN TO SIX EVERY WEEK THE GOVERNMENT LIST SHOWS THE WAGES THAT CAN BE EARNED IN THE VARIOUS TRADES STOKING IN A STEAMSHIP IS A PAINFUL AND DANGEROUS TASKSTOKERS IN STEAMSHIPS ARE RECEIVING TWENTY DOLLARS A DAY AND STILL FEW TAKERS SO THAT THE STEAMSHIPS HAVE TO BE FITTED WITH STOKING MACHINERY AT ONCE ON THE OTHER HAND DRIVING A RURALDELIVERY MAILWAGON IS PLEASANT WORK AND IS PAYING AT PRESENT ONLY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY AND WITH PROSPECTS OF GOING STILL LOWER AND DOES ALL THIS SEEM FANTASTIC TO YOU BUT IT IS EXACTLY THE WAY OUR EMPLOYMENT PROBLEM IS SOLVED TODAY WHEN IT IS SOLVED AT ALL IT IS SOLVED BY MEANS OF HELP WANTED ADVERTISEMENTS AND VIVA VOCE RUMOURSIMPERFECTLY BLINDLY AND SLUGGISHLY INSTEAD OF INSTANTLY INTELLIGENTLY AND CONSCIOUSLY BY A UNIVERSAL GOVERNMENT INFORMATION BUREAU OUT IN THE COUNTRY WHERE I LIVED TWO YEARS AGO THE FARMERS WERE UNABLE TO GET HELP FOR LOVE OR MONEY WHILE MILLIONS WERE OUT OF WORK AND STARVING IN THE CITIES AND THAT IS ONLY ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF ILLUSTRATIONS ONE COULD GIVE OF HOW MUCH DEPENDS WHEN TWO MEN GO OUT TO CATCH A HORSE UPON WHETHER THEY DEVOTE THEIR TIME TO CATCHING HIM OR TO PREVENTING EACH OTHER FROM CATCHING HIM THE INDEPENDENT RECENTLY PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE ENTITLED POVERTY ITS CAUSE AND CURE BY MR JAMES MACKAYE A HARVARD GRADUATE AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHEMIST IN THE COURSE OF ITS EDITORIAL COMMENT THE PAPER HAILED HIS PLAN FOR THE ABOLITION OF POVERTY AS NOTHING LESS THAN A VERY GREAT INVENTION IT ADDS SOMETHING THAT WAS LACKING IN THE OLDER SCHEMES OF SOCIALISM THE INDEPENDENT CONTINUED BUT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO ANY SOCIALISM THAT WOULD BE PRACTICALLY WORKABLE THIS SOMETHING IS A DEVICE TO INCREASE THE SALARIES OF MANAGERS OF THE VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENTS IN PROPORTION AS THEY REDUCED THE PRODUCING TIME OF THE COMMODITY FOR WHICH THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE MR MACKAYE IS ANOTHER STUDENT WHO LIKE PROFESSOR REEVE AND PROFESSOR VEBLEN HAVE COME INTO SOCIALISM BY THEIR OWN ROUTES IN HIS ELABORATE BOOK THE ECONOMY OF HAPPINESS HE SHOWS SO THOROUGH A GRASP OF THE WHOLE SUBJECT THAT I CANNOT SUPPOSE HIM TO SHARE IN THE IGNORANCE OF THE LITERATURE OF MODERN PROLETARIAN SOCIALISM WHICH LEADS THE INDEPENDENT TO HAIL HIS PLAN AS A GREAT INVENTION AS A MATTER OF FACT I COULD NAME A SCORE OF SOCIALIST BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS IN WHICH SUCH PLANS ARE SUGGESTED AND DISCUSSED I PERSONALLY HAVE ALWAYS REJECTED THEM AS UNSOUND IN THEORY AND UNNECESSARY IN PRACTICE I HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CONTINUANCE OF PRESENT OFFICIAL SALARIES AFTER THE REVOLUTION BUT THERE WILL BE A STRONG TENDENCY TO REDUCE THESE AND I CAN SEE NO ULTIMATE RESULT EXCEPT EQUALITY OF COMPENSATION BY THE STATE I CAN SEE NO THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THE STATES PAYING TO ANY EMPLOYEE MORE THAN IT PAYS TO ANOTHER IN THE SAME INDUSTRYHAND LABOUR BEING EQUALLY AS NECESSARY TO THE PRODUCTION OF WEALTH AS IS SUPERINTENDENCE TO MY MIND THE ONLY NECESSARY STIMULUS TO EFFICIENCY IS THE COMMUNITY OF INTEREST OF ALL THE WORKERS THE INCENTIVE TO THE MANAGER IS EMULATION AND THE HIGHER RANGE OF ACTIVITY WHICH GOES WITH A POSITION OF COMMAND AND I SHOULD BE VERY JEALOUS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF ANY PECUNIARY MOTIVE INTO THE STRUGGLE FOR PROMOTIONAS LIKELY TO CONTINUE THE OLD EVILS OF GRAFT AND FAVOURITISM TO WHICH WE ARE NOW SUBJECT I DO NOT THINK THAT WHEN YOU HAVE SO ORGANISED INDUSTRY THAT EVERY MAN IS WORKING FOR HIMSELF YOU WILL FIND IT NECESSARY TO EMPLOY ANY OUTSIDE FORCE TO IMPEL HIM TO WORK AND IN FACT I SHOULD CONSIDER IT A VIOLATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE WORKER TO ATTEMPT ANYTHING OF THE SORT OF COURSE IF THE WORKERS THEMSELVES CHOSE TO OFFER A BONUS TO A MANAGER TO INVENT NEW METHODS THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER MATTER BUT THAT WOULD COME UNDER THE HEAD OF INTELLECTUAL PRODUCTION WHICH I SHALL CONSIDER LATER ON IN DISCUSSING THE QUESTION OF SALARIES IT IS TO BE POINTED OUT WHAT A VAST DIFFERENCE WILL BE MADE IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WHICH EVERY INDIVIDUAL NEEDS BY THE SOCIALISATION OF ALL THE LEADING INDUSTRIES IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC A THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WILL BUY MORE COMFORT AND HAPPINESS THAN TEN THOUSAND IN THE WORLD AS AT PRESENT ORGANISED THERE WILL COME AT THE VERY OUTSET THE GREAT ECONOMIC SAVINGS ALREADY OUTLINED AND THEN THE WHOLE POWER OF THE COPERATIVE MIND OF MAN BEING APPLIED TO THE ELIMINATION OF WASTE AND THE MAKING OF BEAUTY AND JOY WE SHALL HAVE IN A VERY SHORT TIME A WORLD IN WHICH FEW MEN WILL CARE TO CUMBER THEMSELVES WITH POSSESSIONS OF ANY SORT EXCEPTING THE CLOTHES UPON THEIR BACKS AND THE FEW TOOLS OF THEIR INTELLECTUAL TRADESBOOKS MUSIC ETC THE ABOLITION OF PRIVILEGE AND CLASS EXPLOITATION WILL OF COURSE WIPE OUT AT A STROKE ALL THAT COMPETITION IN OSTENTATION WHICH PROFESSOR VEBLEN HAS ENTITLED CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC THERE WILL BE NO LUXURY FOR THERE WILL BE NO SLAVERY THERE WILL BE NO MENIAL SERVICE OF ANY SORT UNDER SOCIALISM I BELIEVE THAT THIS GIVES ONE A KEY BY WHICH HE CAN DO A GREAT DEAL OF PREDICTING AS TO WHAT WILL BE FOUND IN THE WORLD WHEN THE IMPENDING REVOLUTION HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC NO MAN WILL WORK FOR ANOTHER MANEXCEPT FOR LOVEBECAUSE NO OTHER MAN WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THE PREVAILING RATE OF WAGES IT IS THE VISION OF THIS THAT MAKES THE CRITICS OF SOCIALISM CRY OUT THAT IT WILL DESTROY THE HOME WHAT THEY MEAN IS THAT IT WILL DESTROY THAT KIND OF A HOME WHICH EXISTS UPON A BASIS OF BUTLERS COOKS AND KITCHEN MAIDS BANQUETS AND CARRIAGES JEWELLERY AND FINE RAIMENT SWEAT SHOPS AND SLUMS PROSTITUTION CHILDLABOUR WAR AND CRIME UNLESS I AM VERY MUCH MISTAKEN THOSE PEOPLE WHO NOW WEAR DIAMONDS AND DECORATE THEIR HOMES WITH ALL SORTS OF OBJECTS OF ART WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL LESS OF IT IF THEY HAD TO PAY FOR IT WITH THEIR OWN TOILIF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PAY FOR IT WITH MONEY EXTRACTED FROM THE TOIL OF OTHERS I IMAGINE THAT THOSE WHO NOW IN OUR RESTAURANTS AND BANQUET HALLS GORGE THEMSELVES UPON THE CONTENTS OF EARTH SEA AND SKY WOULD DINE VERY MUCH MORE SIMPLYAND VERY MUCH MORE WHOLESOMELYIF THEY HAD TO WASH THE DISHES FOR THIS REASON I EXPECT THAT IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE OF THAT PSEUDOART WHICH MINISTERS TO VANITY AND SENSUALITY OUR HOUSES AND CLOTHING WILL BECOME SIMPLER AND MORE DIGNIFIED AND THE ARTIST WILL TURN HIS THOUGHTS TO PUBLIC WORKSHE WILL DECORATE THE PARKS AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS THE THEATRES CONCERT HALLS AND LIBRARIES THE GREAT COPERATIVE DINING HALLS AND APARTMENT HOUSES IN THE CITIES AND TOWNS OF THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC THERE WILL OF COURSE BE POSSIBILITIES OF BEAUTY SUCH AS WE CANNOT EVEN DREAM OF AT PRESENT NOW OUR CITIES GROW HAPHAZARD AND ARE TYPICAL OF ALL OUR BLINDNESS SELFISHNESS AND MISERY AT EVERY TURN IN THEM ONE COMES UPON NEW AND MORE PAINFUL SIGNS OF THESE THINGSFILTHY AND HORRIBLE SLUMS BLATANT AND VULGAR ADVERTISEMENTS INSOLENT RICH PEOPLE IN CARRIAGES WAN AND STARVING CHILDREN IN THE GUTTERS IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC A CITY WILL BE ONE THING AND A WORK OF ART IT WILL NOT BE CROWDED FOR THE COMBINATION OF POVERTY AND THE RAILROAD TRUST WILL NOT MAKE SPREADING OUT IMPOSSIBLE INTELLIGENT COPERATIVE EFFORT HAVING BECOME THE RULE NEARLY ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE NOW DONE PRIVATELY AND SELFISHLY WILL BE DONE SOCIALLY MANUAL WORK WILL NOT BE A DISGRACE AND POVERTY WILL NOT KEEP ANY MAN IGNORANT FILTHY AND REPULSIVE THERE WILL BE NO CLASSES AND NO CLASS FEELING THERE WILL BE NOT ONLY PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIESTHERE WILL BE PUBLIC PLAYGROUNDS FOR ALL CHILDREN AND CLUBS AND PLACES OF RECREATION FOR MEN AND WOMEN IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC YOU WILL NOT MIND GOING TO SUCH PLACES AND LETTING YOUR CHILDREN GO YOU WILL NOT BE AFRAID OF DISEASE BECAUSE THERE WILL BE PUBLIC HOSPITALS FOR ALL THE SICK AND YOU WILL NOT BE AFRAID OF ROWDIES BECAUSE THE ROWDY IS A PRODUCT OF THE SLUM AND THERE WILL NOT BE ANY SLUM AT PRESENT WE ARE ALL ENGAGED IN A STRUGGLE TO BEGUILE AS MUCH MONEY OUT OF EACH OTHER AS WE CAN AND THE STATE HAS NOTHING TO DO SAVE TO STAND BY AND SEE FAIR PLAYAND COMMONLY FINDS THAT TASK TOO MUCH FOR IT AS A CONSEQUENCE WE FIND OURSELVES CONFRONTED WITH AN INFINITE VARIETY OF LITTLE PETTY EXACTIONSWE HAVE TO SPEND MONEY EVERY TIME WE TURN AROUND VERY SOON AFTER THE REVOLUTION I FANCY MEN WILL BEGIN TO REALISE THAT THESE LITTLE EXACTIONS ARE MORE OF A NUISANCE THAN A SAVING FOR INSTANCE I SHALL BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED IF A GENERATION FROM NOW THE USE OF POSTAGESTAMPS IS NOT ABOLISHED AT PRESENT WITH SOCIETY WASTING SO IMMENSE A PORTION OF ITS ENERGY IN COMPETITIVE ADVERTISING EVERY PIECE OF MATTER WHICH GOES INTO THE MAIL HAS TO BE MADE TO PAY ITS WAY BUT ONCE DO AWAY WITH COMPETITION AND THE ONLY MAIL IS GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS AND PERSONAL LETTERSAND THE TIME IT TAKES TO STAMP AND CANCEL THEM WILL BE MANY TIMES GREATER THAN THE COST OF CARRYING THE ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF LETTERS THAT A FREE MAIL SERVICE WOULD BRING FORTH IN THE SAME WAY IT WILL BE FOUND NOT WORTH WHILE TO EMPLOY CONDUCTORS AND SPOTTERS AND PRINT TICKETS AND TRANSFERS AFTER THAT WE SHALL RIDE FREE ON OUR STREETCARS AND PERHAPS ULTIMATELY IN OUR GOVERNMENT RAILROAD TRAINS SIMILARLY ALL OUR PLACES OF RECREATION AND OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION WOULD COME TO BE FREE AND THEN SOME ONE WOULD REALISE THE WASTE INCIDENTAL TO OUR PRESENT SYSTEM OF BOOK BUYING AND WE SHOULD THEN HAVE A UNIVERSAL NATIONAL LIBRARY FROM WHICH AT FREQUENT INTERVALS DELIVERY SERVICE WOULD BRING YOU ANY BOOKS THEN IN EXISTENCE I HAVE JUST WITNESSED IN NEW YORK AN EXHIBITION OF AN INVENTION WHICH WILL MAKE MUSIC AS FREE AS AIR BELLAMY WAS RIDICULED FOR PREDICTING ELECTRIC MUSIC IN THE YEAR AND IT IS ON SALE IN NEW YORK CITY IN THE YEAR BY THIS MARVELLOUS MACHINE THE TELHARMONIUM ALL PREVIOUSLY EXISTING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RELEGATED TO THE JUNK HEAP AND ALL MUSIC COMPOSED FOR THEM BECOMES OUT OF DATE AT ONE LEAP THE ART OF MUSIC IS SET FREE FROM ALL PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS AND THE MUSICIAN IS GIVEN COMMAND OF ALL POSSIBLE TONES AND MAY PLAY TO TEN THOUSAND AUDIENCES AT ONCE IT IS WORTH WHILE POINTING OUT THAT LIVING UNDER THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM AS WE ARE THE INVENTOR HAD NO RECOURSE SAVE TO USE HIS MACHINE TO MAKE PROFITS AND SO THE NEWSPAPERS WHICH ARE ALSO IN BUSINESS FOR PROFITS LEFT IT TO MAKE ITS OWN WAY SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT THE FIRST PUBLIC EXHIBITION OF AN INVENTION WHICH MEANS MORE TO HUMANITY THAN ANY DISCOVERY SINCE THE ART OF PRINTING RECEIVED MENTION IN ONLY ONE NEW YORK PAPER AND THAT TO THE EXTENT OF THREE OR FOUR INCHES BUT TO RETURN TO THE REVOLUTION AND THE FIRST STEPS WHICH HAVE TO BE TAKEN THERE ARE SOME INDUSTRIES WHICH ANYONE CAN SEE ARE ALL READY FOR PUBLIC OWNERSHIP AND WHEN THE PEOPLE HAVE ONCE FOUND OUT THE WAY THEY WILL BE VERY IMPATIENT WITH ALL REMAINING FORMS OF RENT INTEREST PROFIT AND DIVIDENDS ALSO THE EXPLOITERS WILL SOON LEARN TO GIVE WAY JUST AS SOON AS THE PROPRIETORS OF DEPARTMENT STORES FIND THAT THE PEOPLE SERIOUSLY INTEND TO OPEN A PUBLIC STORE IN EVERY CITY AND TO SELL GOODS AT COST THEY WILL BE GLAD TO SELL OUT FOR A FEW CENTS ON THE DOLLAR JUST AS SOON AS THE BANKERS FIND OUT THAT THERE IS REALLY TO BE A NATIONAL BANK CHARGING NO INTEREST AND INCAPABLE OF FAILING THEY WILL DO THE SAME WITH THEIR BUILDINGS AND OUTFITS TO QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE JUNGLE PAGE THE COPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH IS A UNIVERSAL AUTOMATIC INSURANCE COMPANY AND SAVINGS BANK FOR ALL ITS MEMBERS CAPITAL BEING THE PROPERTY OF ALL INJURY TO IT IS SHARED BY ALL AND MADE UP BY ALL THE BANK IS THE UNIVERSAL GOVERNMENT CREDIT ACCOUNT THE LEDGER IN WHICH EVERY INDIVIDUALS EARNINGS AND SPENDINGS ARE BALANCED THERE IS ALSO A UNIVERSAL GOVERNMENT BULLETIN IN WHICH ARE LISTED AND PRECISELY DESCRIBED EVERYTHING WHICH THE COMMONWEALTH HAS FOR SALE AS NO ONE MAKES ANY PROFIT BY THE SALE THERE IS NO LONGER ANY STIMULUS TO EXTRAVAGANCE AND NO MISREPRESENTATION NO CHEATING NO ADULTERATION OR IMITATION NO BRIBERY NO GRAFTING THERE REMAINS ONLY ONE OTHER GREAT PROBLEM TO BE MENTIONEDTHAT OF AGRICULTURE I THINK NO ONE WILL WANT TO INTERFERE WITH THE FARMER ANY MORE THAN WITH THE COBBLER THE SMALL STOREKEEPER THE NEWSMAN OR ANY OTHER PETTY BUSINESS THE FARMER WILL STAY ON HIS LAND AND MAKE MONEYAND STUDY THE SITUATION HE WILL FIND IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT COPERATION IS A SUCCESS AND HAS COME TO STAY HE WILL FIND THAT WHILE HE IS WORKING WITH HIS HANDS THE REST OF SOCIETY IS WORKING WITH STEAM AND ELECTRICITY AND LEAVING HIM FAR BEHIND HE WILL FIND THAT HE CAN NO LONGER HIRE HELPTHAT HIS HIRED MAN IS EMPLOYED AS A COPERATIVE WORKER AND RECEIVING SEVERAL TIMES MORE THAN THE FARMER HIMSELF HE WILL UNDERSTAND THAT TO GET HIS SHARE OF ALL THE GOOD THINGS OF THE NEW CIVILISATION HE WILL HAVE TO PUT HIS LAND INTO THE COMMON FUND AND WORK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AND NOT FOR HIS OWN WEALTH IN THIS CASE OF COURSE ALL THE RISKS AND LOSSES OF HIS TRADE WILL BE SHARED BY THE WHOLE COMMUNITYTHE RESULT OF A BAD CROP IN MAINE BEING MADE UP BY A GOOD CROP IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT THE FARMER WHO WORKS WILL BE AS CERTAIN OF GAIN AND AS FREE FROM CARE AS THE FACTORY HAND AND NOW LET US CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF THIS NEW SYSTEM UPON CERTAIN OF THE LEADING FEATURES OF OUR CIVILISATION WHAT FOR INSTANCE WILL BE THE EFFECT OF SOCIALISM UPON CRIME THE MAN WHO BECOMES A CRIMINAL AT PRESENT FINDS HIMSELF IN A WORLD WHERE HE IS COMPELLED TO WORK FOR SOME OTHER MANS PROFIT AND TO HAVE FLAUNTED IN HIS FACE EVERY HOUR THE WEALTH WHICH HAS BEEN EXACTED FROM HIS TOIL BUT NOW HE WILL FIND HIMSELF IN A WORLD FROM WHICH LUXURY AND PAUPERISM HAVE BEEN BANISHED AND IN WHICH COPERATION AND MUTUAL FELLOWSHIP IS THE LAW HE WILL FIND THAT HE GETS JUST WHAT HE PRODUCES AND THAT HE CAN PRODUCE IN A DAY MORE THAN HE CAN STEAL IN A MONTH DONT YOU THINK THAT THE CRIMINAL MAY FIND THESE POWERFUL MOTIVES TO BECOME A WORKER HE MAY BE A DEGENERATE OF COURSE IN WHICH CASE WE SHALL PUT HIM IN A HOSPITAL WE SHOULD DO THAT NOW IF WE DID NOT FEEL DIMLY THAT IT WOULD BE OF NO USE BECAUSE OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM IS MAKING CRIMINALS FASTER THAN WE CAN PEN THEM UP AND MAKES THE LIFE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE WORKINGCLASS SO HORRIBLE THAT MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO STEAL ON PURPOSE TO GET INTO JAIL I HAVE TRIED IN THE JUNGLE TO GIVE A PICTURE OF THE PROCESS WHEREBY THE FORCES OF COMMERCIALISM TURN HONEST WORKINGMEN INTO CRIMINALS AND TRAMPS THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER STORY TO WHICH I WOULD REFER THE READER WHO CARES TO HAVE MORE ACQUAINTANCE WITH SUCH CONDITIONSAN EYE FOR AN EYE BY CLARENCE DARROWAND ALSO WHILE WE ARE CONSIDERING THIS SUBJECT LET US NOT FORGET HOW THE CHANGE WOULD AFFECT THE CRIMINALS OF THE FUTURE THE WRETCHED CHILDREN OF THE SLUMS AND GUTTERS WHO WILL NOW BE CARED FOR BY THE STATE AND MADE INTO DECENT CITIZENS IN PUBLIC ASYLUMS AND HOSPITALS TRAINING SCHOOLS AND PLAYGROUNDS WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECT OF SOCIALISM UPON PROSTITUTION ANY YOUNG GIRL CAN GO TO THE PUBLIC FACTORIES OR STORES TO THE COPERATIVE BOARDING HOUSES AND HOTELS THE SCHOOLS AND NURSERY PLAYGROUNDS AND SECURE EMPLOYMENT FOR THE ASKING AND SUPPORT HERSELF BY A COUPLE OF HOURS WORK A DAY IN DECENT AND ATTRACTIVE SURROUNDINGS SHE WILL MOREOVER BE ABLE TO MARRY THE MAN WHO LOVES HER BECAUSE THE PROBLEM OF A LIVING WILL NO LONGER ENTER INTO THE QUESTION OF MARRIAGE SHE WILL BE ABLE TO RESTRICT HER FAMILY TO AS MANY AS SHE AND HER HUSBAND CARE TO SUPPORT BECAUSE SHE WILL BE AS INTELLIGENT AND SENSIBLE AS THE WOMEN OF OUR PRESENT UPPER CLASSES THE QUESTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SYSTEM OF WAGESLAVERY TO THE LIVES OF WOMEN IS TOO VAST A ONE TO BE EVEN OUTLINED HERE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT THE SOCIALIST BATTLE IS THE BATTLE OF WOMAN EVEN MORE THAN IT IS THE BATTLE OF THE WORKINGMAN I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN TO REFER THE READER TO ANOTHER BOOK IN WHICH THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE EFFECTS WHICH AGELONG CONDITIONS OF ECONOMIC INFERIORITY HAS WROUGHT IN THE MINDS AND BODIES OF WOMEN IS DISCUSSED IN SCIENTIFIC AND YET FASCINATING FORMMRS GILMANS WOMAN AND ECONOMICS WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECT OF SOCIALISM UPON DRUNKENNESS UNDER SOCIALISM THE WORKINGMAN WILL HAVE A DECENT HOME AND ATTRACTIVE CLUBS READING ROOMS AND PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT OF ALL SORTS WITH PLENTY OF TIME TO FREQUENT THEM HE WILL HAVE STEADY EMPLOYMENT WHOLESOME FOOD A PLEASANT PLACE TO WORK IN ANDRAILROAD FARES BEING ALMOST NOTHINGA TRIP TO THE COUNTRY WHEN HE FANCIES IT HIS WIFE WILL NOT BE AN OVERWORKED REPULSIVE DRUDGE AND HIS CHILDREN WILL NOT BE STARVING BRATS WHEN HE WANTS A DRINK HE WILL GO TO A PUBLIC DRINKINGPLACE AND GET IT WHAT HE GETS WILL BE PURE AND WILL BE SOLD HIM BY A MAN WHO HAS NO INTEREST IN GETTING HIM DRUNK ON THE CONTRARY THE ATTENDANT MAY BE GETTING A ROYALTY UPON ALL NONINTOXICATING DRINKS HE SELLS AND THE DRINKER WILL QUITE CERTAINLY BE PAYING A BIG TAX UPON ALL THE INTOXICATING DRINKS HE BUYS DO YOU NOT THINK THAT ALL THIS MAY HAVE SOME EFFECT UPON THE NATIONS DRINK BILL WHICH NOW IS DOUBLING ITSELF EVERY DECADE RECENTLY I WAS INVITED BY THE CHRISTIAN HERALD TO CONTRIBUTE TO A SYMPOSIUM UPON THE QUESTION OF PROHIBITION I WROTE AS FOLLOWS IN MY OPINION THE DRINK EVIL IS PRIMARILY AN EFFECT AND NOT A CAUSE IT IS A BYPRODUCT OF WAGESLAVERY THE WORKING CLASSES ARE TODAY ORGANISED AS THE BOND SLAVES OF CAPITAL THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY LIVE ARE SUCH AS TO BRUTALISE AND DEGRADE THEM AND DRIVE THEM TO DRINK AS I HAVE PHRASED IT IN THE JUNGLE IF A MAN HAS TO LIVE IN HELL HE WOULD A GREAT DEAL RATHER BE DRUNK THAN SOBER THE SOLUTION OF THE DRINK EVIL WAITS UPON THE COMING OF SOCIALISM AS A PART OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM YOU HAVE LIQUOR SOLD FOR PROFIT AND THE LIQUOR INTERESTS ARE ONE OF THE FORCES WHICH DOMINATE THE LAND THEREFORE YOU ARE UNABLE TO EFFECT ANY LEGISLATION TO CORRECT THE EVIL LIQUOR IS SOLD IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF THE VICTIM THEREFORE EVERY INDUCEMENT AND TEMPTATION IS LAID BEFORE HIM UNDER SOCIALISM THE ONLY BARKEEPER WOULD BE THE COMMUNITY AND THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE EVERY OBJECT IN LIMITING THE TRAFFIC THE CHILDREN OF THE MASSES WOULD BE TAKEN IN HAND AND TAUGHT THE SECRET OF RIGHT LIVING AND WHEN THEY GREW UP THEY WOULD HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT AND THE MEANS OF KEEPING IN WORKING CONDITION AND WOULD KNOW OTHER SOURCES OF HAPPINESS THAN DRUNKENNESS AT PRESENT ATTEMPTS TO REFORM THE EVIL ARE ATTEMPTS TO SWEEP BACK THE TIDE MOREOVER IT IS TO BE NOTICED THAT MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE MOST ACTIVE IN THE WORK ARE THEMSELVES BUSILY ENGAGED IN EXPLOITING THE WORKINGCLASS IN THEIR PRIVATE BUSINESS AND ARE THEREFORE DIRECTLY IDENTIFIED WITH THE CAUSE OF THE EVIL THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO COMBAT WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECT OF SOCIALISM UPON WAR THE NEW YORK SUN RECENTLY EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THE END OF WAR WILL COME ONLY WITH THE GOLDEN AGE IF SO THE GOLDEN AGE IS WITHIN SIGHT OF ALL OF US SOCIALISM WILL ABOLISH WAR AS INEVITABLY AS NATURALLY AND SERENELY AS THE SUNRISE ABOLISHES THE NIGHT THE CAUSE OF WAR IS FOREIGN MARKETS AND UNDER SOCIALISM THE MARKETS WILL ALL BE AT HOME UNDER SOCIALISM THE EXISTENCE OF THE WORKERS OF THE UNITED STATES OF ENGLAND GERMANY AND JAPAN WILL NOT BE DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF THEIR MASTERS TO SELL THEIR SURPLUS PRODUCTS FOR PROFIT TO CHINAMEN UNDER SOCIALISM AN INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS WILL TAKE IN HAND THE BACKWARD NATIONS WILL CLEAN OUT THEIR SEWERS AND WIPE OUT THEIR PLAGUES AND FAMINES THEIR KINGS AND THEIR CAPITALISTS THEIR IGNORANCE THEIR SUPERSTITION AND THEIR WARS IT WILL DO THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE DONEIT WILL NOT DO THEM AS A MERE PRETENCE TO COVER GREED FOR GOLD MINES AND MARKETS OUTSIDE OF MINES AND MARKETS THERE IS NO LONGER ANY CAUSE OF WAR SAVE THE OLD RACE HATREDS WHICH THESE HAVE BEGOTTEN AND RACE HATREDS ARE NOT KNOWN AMONG SOCIALISTS IN THEIR LAST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS A RUSSIAN AND A JAPANESE SHOOK HANDS UPON THE PLATFORM WHILE THEIR COUNTRYMEN WERE FLYING AT EACH OTHERS THROATS IN MANCHURIA THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT IS A WORLD MOVEMENTIT HAS BROUGHT UNDER ITS BANNERS WORKING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER MEN AND WOMEN OF ALL RELIGIONS RACES AND COLOURS WITH THEIR VICTORY AND ONLY WITH THEIR VICTORY WILL THE EFFORTS OF PEACE CONGRESSES BEAR FRUIT FINALLY WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECT OF SOCIALISM UPON THE SYSTEM IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CORRUPTION AS A SPORADIC EVENT AN ACCIDENT HERE AND THERE AND CORRUPTION AS A NATIONAL INSTITUTION IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC A WORKER MIGHT OF COURSE BRIBE HIS FOREMAN TO LET HIM CHEAT THE COMMUNITY BUT THAT WOULD BE EVERY MANS LOSS AND THERE WOULD BE EVERY INDUCEMENT TO FIND IT OUT AND MAKE IT KNOWN AND NO HINDRANCE WHATEVER TO ITS PUNISHMENT AT PRESENT HOWEVER WE HAVE CORRUPTION ORGANISED IN TOWN COUNTY CITY STATE AND NATION WITH EVERY INDUCEMENT TO KEEP IT HIDDEN AND ALMOST NO POSSIBILITY OF PUNISHING IT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT WE HAVE CORPORATIONS AND THAT THE CORPORATIONS RULE US ALL THAT EVERYBODY DOES NOT YET UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE CONTINUANCE OF THEIR RULE WOULD MEAN THE RUIN OF FREE INSTITUTIONS IN AMERICA AND ULTIMATELY THE DOWNFALL OF CIVILISATION ITSELF I HAVE OUTLINED THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS WHICH I BELIEVE WILL PREVAIL IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC THERE REMAINS TO CONSIDER WHAT INFLUENCES THESE WILL EXERT UPON THE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF MEN WHEN PEOPLE CRITICISE THE SOCIALIST PROGRAMME THEY ALWAYS THINK ABOUT GOVERNMENT CENSORS AND RED TAPE AND LIMITATIONS UPON FREE ENDEAVOUR AND SO THEY SAY THAT SOCIALISM WOULD LEAD TO A REIGN OF TAMENESS AND MEDIOCRITY THEY TELL US THAT UNDER THE NEW RGIME WE SHOULD ALL HAVE TO WEAR THE SAME KIND OF COAT AND EAT THE SAME KIND OF PIE THEY ARGUE THAT IF ALL THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION ARE OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT THERE WILL BE NO WAY FOR YOU TO GET YOUR OWN KIND OF PIE FAILING TO PERCEIVE THAT GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION NO MORE IMPLIES GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT THAN GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF THE POST OFFICE MEANS GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF THE CONTENTS OF YOUR LETTERS SAID A GOOD CLERGYMAN FRIEND OF MINE WHAT POSSIBLE PLACE FOR INSTANCE WOULD THERE BE FOR ME IN YOUR SOCIALIST SOCIETY AND I ANSWERED THERE WOULD BE JUST EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE FOR YOU THAT THERE IS AT PRESENT HOW IS IT THAT YOU GET YOUR LIVING AND YOUR FREEDOM YOU ARE MAINTAINED BY AN ASSOCIATION OF PEOPLE WHO WANT THE WORK YOU CAN DO EVERY CLERGYMAN IN THE COUNTRY IS MAINTAINED IN THAT WAYAND SO ARE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF EDITORS AUTHORS ARTISTS ACTORSSO ARE ALL OUR CLUBS SOCIETIES RESTAURANTS THEATRES AND ORCHESTRAS THE GOVERNMENT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM AT PRESENTAND THE GOVERNMENT NEED HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM UNDER SOCIALISM THE PEOPLE WHO WANT THEM SUBSCRIBE AND PAY FOR THEM UNDER OUR PRESENT SYSTEM THEY PAY THE COST TO PRIVATE PROFITSEEKERS UNDER SOCIALISM THEY WOULD PAY THE STATE IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC A MAN WILL BE ABLE TO ORDER ANYTHING HE WISHES FROM A FLYING MACHINE TO A SEVENLEGGED SPIDER MADE OF DIAMONDS AND THE ONLY QUESTION THAT ANYONE WILL EVER DREAM OF ASKING HIM WILL BE HAVE YOU GOT THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT THERE REMAINS ONLY TO ADD THAT THE SYSTEM OF WEALTHDISTRIBUTION BEING NOW ONE OF JUSTICE THAT QUESTION WILL MEAN HAVE YOU PERFORMED FOR SOCIETY THE EQUIVALENT OF THE LABOURTIME OF THE ARTICLE YOU DESIRE SOCIETY TO FURNISH YOU NINETENTHS OF THE ARGUMENT AGAINST SOCIALISM DISSOLVES INTO MIST THE MOMENT ONE STATES THAT SINGLE ALLIMPORTANT FACT THAT SOCIALISM IS A SCIENCE OF ECONOMICS FOR INSTANCE MR BRYAN HAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED IN THE CENTURY MAGAZINE AN ARTICLE ENTITLED INDIVIDUALISM VERSUS SOCIALISM AND HERE IS THE WAY HE CONTRASTS THE TWO THE INDIVIDUALIST BELIEVES THAT COMPETITION IS NOT ONLY A HELPFUL BUT A NECESSARY FORCE IN SOCIETY TO BE GUARDED AND PROTECTED THE SOCIALIST REGARDS COMPETITION AS A HURTFUL FORCE TO BE ENTIRELY EXTERMINATED NOW THERE ARE ENDLESS VARIETIES OF COMPETITION WITH WHICH SOCIALISM COULD IN NO CONCEIVABLE WAY INTERFERE THE COMPETITION OF LOVE AND OF FRIENDSHIP THE COMPETITION OF POLITICAL LIFE THE COMPETITION OF IDEALS OF MUSIC AND BOOKS OF PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE IT IS THE CLAIM OF THE SOCIALISTS THAT BY SETTING MEN FREE FROM THE MONEYGREED AND THE MONEYTERRORFROM THE NEED OF STRUGGLING TO DEPRIVE OTHER MEN OF THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE IN ORDER TO PREVENT THEM FROM DEPRIVING YOU OF THESE NECESSITIESTHE MIND OF THE RACE WOULD BE SET FREE FOR MORE VIGOROUS COMPETITION IN THESE OTHER FIELDS AND THUS THE DEVELOPMENT OF REAL INDIVIDUALITY WOULD BE FOR THE FIRST TIME MADE POSSIBLE THIS BEING THE DESIRE OF THE SOCIALIST IT SHOULD BE CLEAR HOW FUNDAMENTAL IS THE MISCONCEPTION OF MR BRYAN INDICATED BY THE BARE TITLE OF HIS ARTICLEINDIVIDUALISM VERSUS SOCIALISM SOCIALISM IS NOT OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUALISM AND TO SET THE TWO IN OPPOSITION IS LIKE THE ATTEMPT TO IMAGINE A FIGHT BETWEEN AN ELEPHANT AND A WHALE SOCIALISM IS A PROPOSITION FOR AN ECONOMIC REORGANISATION AS SUCH THE ONLY THING TO WHICH IT CAN LOGICALLY AND INTELLIGENTLY BE OPPOSED IS CAPITALISM MR BRYAN INDICATES THAT HE DISCERNS THIS IN ANOTHER PORTION OF HIS ARTICLE HE SAYS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS DISCUSSION INDIVIDUALISM WILL BE DEFINED AS THE PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION WHERE COMPETITION IS POSSIBLE LEAVING TO PUBLIC OWNERSHIP THOSE MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION IN WHICH COMPETITION IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND SOCIALISM WILL BE DEFINED AS THE COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP THROUGH THE STATE OF ALL THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION FOR GENERAL UNFAIRNESS THIS STATEMENT MAKES ME THINK OF THE STORY OF A MAN WHO WAS RIDING THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND STOPPED TO ADMIRE A FINE PAIR OF TURKEYS AND AFTER PRAISING THEM WITH ENTHUSIASM REMARKED TO THE FARMER I WILL MATCH YOU FOR THEM HEADS THEY ARE MINE AND TAILS THEY STAY YOURS MR BRYAN HAS COMPOSED A SUBTLY WORDED DEFINITION OF INDIVIDUALISM WHICH TAKES ALL THE KERNELS FROM THE SOCIALIST EAR AND LEAVES TO THE SOCIALIST ONLY THE HUSK LEAVING TO PUBLIC OWNERSHIP THOSE MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION IN WHICH COMPETITION IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL FIELD FOR CONTROVERSY AND WHAT ENDLESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPROMISE AND CONCESSION FOR ADVANCE OR RETREAT TEN YEARS AGO MR BRYAN WOULD NOT HAVE APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY OF INSERTING THIS CLAUSE INDUSTRIAL EVOLUTION HAD NOT PROCEEDED QUITE SO FAR AND ALL OUR RADICALS WERE BENDING THEIR EFFORTS TO DESTROYING THE TRUSTS IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN THAT MR BRYAN DEFINITELY COMMITTED HIMSELF TO THE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THOSE MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION IN WHICH COMPETITION IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE IF MR BRYAN WOULD ONLY PROCURE AND READ A REALLY AUTHORITATIVE TREATISE UPON MODERN SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM SAY VANDERVELDES COLLECTIVISM AND INDUSTRIAL EVOLUTION HE WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT HIS PROGRAMME IS SO CLOSE TO THAT OF THE SOCIALISTS THAT THE DIFFERENCE WOULD REQUIRE A MICROSCOPE TO DISCERN IN FACT I IMAGINE THAT THE MAJORITY OF MODERN PROLETARIAN THINKERS WOULD BE WILLING TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE PROGRAMME OF INDIVIDUALISM EXACTLY AS MR BRYAN STATES IT THE PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION WHERE COMPETITION IS POSSIBLE LEAVING TO PUBLIC OWNERSHIP THOSE MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION IN WHICH COMPETITION IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE THE ONE POINT TO BE MADE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IN THIS MATTER IS THAT THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC WILL BE AN ORGANISATION FOR THE SUPPLYING OF THE MATERIAL NECESSITIES OF HUMAN LIFE WITH THE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL AFFAIRS OF MEN IT CAN HAVE VERY LITTLE TO DO WHAT SOCIALISM PROPOSES TO ORGANISE AND SYSTEMATISE IS INDUSTRY NOT THOUGHT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRODUCTS OF INDUSTRY AND THOSE OF THOUGHT IS A FUNDAMENTAL ONE THE FORMER ARE STRICTLY LIMITED IN QUANTITY AND THE LATTER ARE INFINITE NO MAN CAN HAVE MORE THAN HIS FAIR SHARE OF THE FORMER WITHOUT DEPRIVING HIS NEIGHBOUR BUT TO A THOUGHT THERE IS NO SUCH LIMITA SINGLE POEM OR SYMPHONY MAY DO FOR A MILLION JUST AS WELL AS FOR ONE WITH THE FORMER IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ONE MAN TO GAIN CONTROL AND OPPRESS OTHERS BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MONOPOLISE THOUGHT AND IT IS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FACT THAT LAWS AND SYSTEMS ARE NECESSARY WITH THE THINGS OF THE BODY WHICH WOULD BE PREPOSTEROUS WITH THE THINGS OF THE MIND THE BODILY NEEDS OF MEN ARE PRETTY MUCH ALL ALIKE MEN NEED FOOD CLOTHING SHELTER LIGHT AIR AND HEAT AND THEY NEED THESE OF PRETTY NEARLY THE SAME QUALITY AND IN PRETTY NEARLY THE SAME QUANTITYSO THAT THEY CAN BE FURNISHED METHODICALLY YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT ACCORDING TO ORDER THIS IS BEING DONE BY OUR PRESENT INDUSTRIAL MASTERS FOR PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC IT WILL BE DONE BY THE STATE FOR USE QUITE OTHERWISE IS IT WITH THINGS IN WHICH MEN ARE NOT ALIKETHEIR RELIGIONS AND THEIR ARTS AND THEIR SCIENCES THE ONLY CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE STATE CAN WITH ANY JUSTICE OR EFFICIENCY HAVE TO DO WITH PRODUCTION IN THESE FIELDS IS AFTER MEN HAVE COME TO AGREEMENTWHEN OPINION HAS GIVEN PLACE TO KNOWLEDGE FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE IN CERTAIN FIELDS OF SCIENCE METHODS WHICH WE CAN CONSIDER AS AGREED UPON IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY POSSIBLE FOR THE STATE TO ENDOW ASTRONOMICAL INVESTIGATORS AND SEEKERS OF THE NORTH POLE AND INVENTORS OF FLYING MACHINES AND PIONEERS IN ALL THE TECHNICAL ARTS IN THE SAME WAY WE COME TO AGREE WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS WHAT IS A WORTHWHILE PLAY OR BOOK IN SO FAR AS WE AGREE WE CAN HAVE GOVERNMENT THEATRES AND PUBLISHING HOUSES GOVERNMENT NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES IF EVER SCIENCE SHOULD DISCOVER THE RATIONALE OF THE PHENOMENON OF GENIUS SO THAT WE COULD ANALYSE AND JUDGE IT WITH PRECISION WE SHOULD THEN HAVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM SOLVED YOU ARE A WRITER PERHAPS AND YOU SAY THAT YOU WOULD NOT RELISH THE IDEA OF BRINGING YOUR BOOK TO A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL TO BE JUDGED ASK YOURSELF HOWEVER IF SOME OF YOUR PREJUDICE MAY NOT BE DUE TO YOUR CONCEPTION OF A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A CLASS AND OF THE INTERESTS OF A CLASS IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC THERE WILL BE NO CLASSES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE COPERATIVE PUBLISHING HOUSE WILL HAVE NO ONE TO SERVE BUT THE PEOPLE IF THEY ARE NOT SATISFACTORY TO THE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE CAN GET RID OF THEMSOMETHING THE PEOPLE CANNOT DO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TODAY YOU THINK PERHAPS THAT YOU CHOOSE YOUR OWN GOVERNORS IN THIS COUNTRYBUT YOU DO NOT WHAT YOU DO IS TO GO TO THE POLLS AND CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO SETS OF CANDIDATES BOTH OF WHOM HAVE BEEN SELECTED BY YOUR ECONOMIC RULERS AS BEING SATISFACTORY TO THEM WHILE I DO NOT PROFESS TO BE CERTAIN I IMAGINE THAT AN AUTHOR WHO WANTED HIS BOOK PUBLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE EXPENSES OF THE PUBLICATION THIS WOULD NOT BE ANY HARDSHIP FOR WAGES IN THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC COULD NOT BE LESS THAN TEN DOLLARS FOR A DAY OF SIX HOURS WORK WITH THE RAPID IMPROVEMENT IN MACHINERY AND METHODS THAT WOULD FOLLOW THEY WOULD PROBABLY SOON BE DOUBLE THATAND OF COURSE IT WOULD REST WITH THE PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING THE WORK TO SEE THAT IT WAS DONE IN AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE WITH PLENTY OF FRESH AIR AND DUE SAFEGUARDS AGAINST ACCIDENTS UNDER THESE CONDITIONS A MAN OF REFINEMENT COULD GO TO A FACTORY TO WORK FOR PLEASURE AND EXERCISE INSTEAD OF PULLING AT ROPES IN A GYMNASIUM AS HE COMMONLY DOES NOWADAYS AND WHEN A YOUNG AUTHOR HAD EARNED THE COST OF MAKING HIS BOOK HE WOULD HAVE DONE ALL THAT HE HAD TO DO HE WOULD NOT HAVE TO ENTER INTO A RACE IN VULGAR ADVERTISING WITH EXPLOITING PRIVATE CONCERNS NOR WOULD THE PUBLIC FORM ITS IDEAS OF HIS WORK FROM CRITICISMS IN REVIEWS WHICH WERE RUN TO SECURE ADVERTISEMENTS AND WHICH GAVE THEIR SPACE TO THE BOOKS THAT WERE ADVERTISED THE MOST NEITHER WOULD HIS CRITICS BE EMPLOYED BY A CLASS TO MAINTAIN THE INTERESTS OF A CLASS AND TO KEEP DOWN THE ASPIRATIONS OF SOME OTHER CLASS ALSO THE BOOKREADING PUBLIC WOULD NO LONGER CONSISTAS OUR PRESENT SOCIETY SO LARGELY CONSISTSOF IDLE AND UNFEELING RICH AND IGNORANT DEBASED AND HUNGERDRIVEN POOR AND THEN AS I SAID THERE IS A SECOND METHODTHE METHOD OF THE CHURCHES AND CLUBS OUT IN CHICAGO THERE WAS FOUR YEARS AGO A MAN WHO THOUGHT THERE OUGHT TO BE MORE SOCIALIST BOOKS PUBLISHED THAN THERE WERE HE HAD NO MONEY BUT HE DREW UP A PROGRAMME FOR A COPERATIVE PUBLISHING HOUSE TO FURNISH SOCIALIST LITERATURE AT COST TO THOSE WHO WANTED IT HE GOT SOME TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TENDOLLAR SHARES AND SINCE THEN HE HAS BEEN TURNING OUT HALF A MILLION PIECES OF SOCIALIST LITERATURE EVERY YEAR THAT SEEMS TO ME A PERFECT ILLUSTRATION OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE NEW SOCIETY THE SECOND WAY IN WHICH BOOKS WOULD BE PUBLISHED SUCH CONCERNSFREE ASSOCIATIONS AS THEY ARE TERMED IN THE SOCIALIST VOCABULARYWOULD SPRING UP LITERALLY BY THE THOUSANDS THEY WOULD COVER EVERY FIELD THAT THE LIBERATED SOUL OF MAN MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN THEY WOULD CARE FOR EVERY TYPE OF THINKER AND ARTIST NO MATTER HOW ECCENTRIC THEY WOULD OFFER ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY MAN WHO SHOWED THE SLIGHTEST SIGN OF POWER IN ANY FIELD THE ONLY REASON WE DO NOT HAVE MANY TIMES AS MANY OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS AS WE HAVE NOW IS SIMPLY THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO REALLY CARE ABOUT THE HIGHER THINGS OF LIFE ARE ALMOST INVARIABLY POOR AND HELPLESS ONE OF THE CURIOUS THINGS WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED ABOUT THOSE WHO PICK FLAWS IN THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE SOCIALIST IS HOW SELDOM IT EVER OCCURS TO THEM TO APPLY THEIR OWN TESTS TO THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF THINGS HOW IS IT WITH ART AND LITERATURE PRODUCTION NOWARE ALL THE CONDITIONS QUITE FREE FROM OBJECTION IS THE MAN OF GENIUS ALWAYS ENCOURAGED AND PROTECTED AND SET FREE TO DEVELOP HIS POWERS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THERE APPEARED AN ARTICLE BY MRS GERTRUDE ATHERTON IN WHICH SHE SET FORTH HER OPINION THAT AMERICAN LITERATURE TODAY IS THE MOST TIMID THE MOST ANMIC THE MOST LACKING IN INDIVIDUALITIES THE MOST BOURGEOIS THAT ANY COUNTRY HAS EVER KNOWN THIS SEEMED TO PERPLEX MRS ATHERTON VERY MUCHSHE COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHY SUCH A VERY GREAT COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE A BOURGEOIS LITERATURE I REPLIED TO HER IN A PAPER WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN COLLIERS WEEKLY IN WHICH I MAINTAINED THAT AMERICAN LITERATURE IS THE MOST BOURGEOIS THAT ANY COUNTRY HAS EVER KNOWN SIMPLY BECAUSE AMERICAN LIFE IS THE MOST BOURGEOIS THAT ANY COUNTRY HAS EVER KNOWN I SHALL QUOTE A FEW PARAGRAPHS FROM THE ESSAY WHICH BEGAN WITH AN ATTEMPT TO DEFINE THE WORD BOURGEOIS IT SIGNIFIES IN A SENTENCE THAT TYPE OF CIVILISATION OF LAW AND CONVENTION WHICH WAS MADE NECESSARY BY THE ECONOMIC STRUGGLE AND WHICH IS NOW MAINTAINED BY THE ECONOMIC VICTORS FOR THEIR OWN COMFORT AND THE PERPETUATION OF THEIR POWER THE BOURGEOISIE OR MIDDLE CLASS IS THAT CLASS WHICH ALL OVER THE WORLD TAKES THE SCEPTRE OF POWER AS IT FALLS FROM THE HANDS OF THE POLITICAL ARISTOCRACY WHICH HAS THE SKILL AND CUNNING TO SURVIVE IN THE FREEFORALL COMBAT WHICH FOLLOWS UPON THE POLITICAL REVOLUTION ITS DOMINION IS BASED UPON WEALTH AND HENCE THE DETERMINING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE BOURGEOIS SOCIETY IS ITS REGARD FOR WEALTH TO IT WEALTH IS POWER IT IS THE END AND GOAL OF THINGS THE ARISTOCRAT KNEW NOTHING OF THE POSSIBILITY OF REVOLUTION AND SO HE WAS BOLD AND GAY THE BOURGEOIS DOES KNOW ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF REVOLUTION AND SO IT IS THAT MRS ATHERTON FINDS THAT OUR LITERATURE IS TIMID SHE FINDS IT ANMIC SIMPLY BECAUSE THE BOURGEOIS IDEAL KNOWS NOTHING OF THE SPIRIT AND TOLERATES INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY ONLY FOR THE ENDS OF COMMERCE AND MATERIAL WELFARE SHE FINDS ALSO THAT IT BOWS BEFORE THE FETICH OF THE BODY AND SHE IS MUCH PERPLEXED BY THE DISCOVERY SHE DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOURGEOIS REPRESENTS AN ACHIEVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THAT ALL THAT HE KNOWS IN THE WORLD IS BODY HE IS WELL FED HIMSELF HIS WIFE IS STOUT AND HIS CHILDREN ARE FINE AND VIGOROUS HE LIVES IN A BIG HOUSE AND WEARS THE LATEST THING IN CLOTHES HIS CIVILISATION FURNISHES THESE TO EVERY ONEAT LEAST TO EVERY ONE WHO AMOUNTS TO ANYTHING AND BEYOND THAT HE UNDERSTANDS NOTHINGSAVE ONLY THE DESIRE TO BE ENTERTAINED IT IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT THAT HE BUYS BOOKS AND AS ENTERTAINMENT THAT HE REGARDS THEM AND HENCE ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF THE BOURGEOIS LITERATURE IS ITS LACK OF SERIOUSNESS THE BOURGEOIS WRITER HAS A CERTAIN KIND OF SERIOUSNESS OF COURSETHE SERIOUSNESS OF A HUNGRY MAN SEEKING HIS DINNER BUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ARTIST HE DOES NOT KNOW HE WILL ROAR YOU AS GENTLY AS ANY SUCKING DOVE HE WILL ALSO WRING TEARS FROM YOUR EYES OR THRILL YOU WITH TERROR ACCORDING AS THE FASHION OF THE HOUR SUGGESTS BUT HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHY HE DOES THESE THINGS AND HE CAN DO THEM BETWEEN CHATS AT HIS CLUB IF YOU EXPECTED HIM TO ACT LIKE HIS HEROES HE WOULD THINK THAT YOU WERE MAD THE BASIS OF A BOURGEOIS SOCIETY IS CASH PAYMENT IT RECOGNISES ONLY THE ACCOMPLISHED FACT TO BE A MILTON WITH A PARADISE LOST IN YOUR POCKET IS TO BE A TRAMP TO BE A GREAT AUTHOR IN THE BOURGEOIS LITERARY WORLD IS TO HAVE SOLD A HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES AND TO HAVE SOLD THEM WITHIN MEMORYTHAT IS A YEAR OR TWO WITH THE BOURGEOIS SUCCESS IS SUCCESS AND THERE IS NO GOING BEHIND THE RETURNS TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF SUCCESS WOULD BE TO INTRODUCE NEW AND DANGEROUS DISTINCTIONS AS MR JOHN L SULLIVAN ONCE PHRASED IT A BIG MAN IS A BIG MAN IT DONT MATTER IF HES A PRIZEFIGHTER OR A PRESIDENT MR JOHN L SULLIVAN IS A BIG MAN HIMSELF SO IS MR FRANK MUNSEY AND SO WAS MR HENRY ROMEIKE AND SO WAS SENATOR HANNA SO ARE THEY ALL ALL HONOURABLE MEN AND WHEN YOU LOOK UP IN WHOS WHO YOU FIND THAT THEY ARE THERE THE BOURGEOIS IDEAL IS A PERFECTLY DEFINITE AND CONCRETE ONE IT HAS MOSTLY ALL BEEN ATTAINEDTHERE ARE ONLY A FEW SMALL DETAILS LEFT TO BE ATTENDED TO SUCH AS THE CLEANING OF THE STREETS AND THE SUPPRESSING OF THE LABOUR UNIONS THUS THERE IS NO CALL FOR PERPLEXITY AND NO USE FOR ANYTHING HARD TO UNDERSTAND ORIGINALITY IS SUPERFLUOUS AND ECCENTRICITY IS ANATHEMA THE WORLD IS AS IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND HUMAN NATURE WILL ALWAYS BE AS IT IS THE THING TO DO IS TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PUBLIC LIKES THE PUBLIC LIKES PATHOS AND THE HOMELY VIRTUES AND SO WE GIVE IT EBEN HOLDEN AND DAVID HARUM THE PUBLIC LIKES HIGH LIFE AND SO WE GIVE IT RICHARD HARDING DAVIS AND MARIE CORELLI THE PUBLIC DOES NOT LIKE PASSION IT LIKES SENTIMENT HOWEVERIT EVEN LIKES HEROICS PROVIDED THEY ARE CONVENTIONALISED AND SO TO AMUSE IT WE TURN ALL HISTORY INTO A SUGARCOATED ROMANCE THE PUBLICS STRONG POINT IS LOVE AND WE LAY MUCH STRESS UPON THE LOVEELEMENTTHOUGH WITH LIMITATIONS NEEDLESS TO SAY THE IDEA OF LOVE AS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AMONG MEN AND WOMEN IS DISMISSED BECAUSE THE SOCIAL ORGANISATION ENABLES US TO SATISFY OUR PASSIONS WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF THE POOR OUR OWN DAUGHTERS KNOW NOTHING ABOUT PASSION AND WE OURSELVES KNOW IT ONLY AS AN ITEM IN OUR BANK ACCOUNTS TO THE BOURGEOIS YOUNG LADYTHE GIBSON GIRL AS SHE IS OTHERWISE KNOWNLITERARY LOVE IS A SENTIMENT RANKING WITH A BOX OF BONBONS AND ACTUAL LOVE IS A CLASS MARRIAGE WITH AN ARTIFICIALLY RESTRICTED PROGENY THESE WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED ARE THE POSITIVE AND MORE GENIAL ASPECTS OF THE BOURGEOIS CIVILISATION THE SAVAGE AND TERRIBLE REMAIN TO BE MENTIONED FOR IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS CIVILISATION OF COMFORT AND RESPECTABILITY FURNISHES ITS GOOD THINGS ONLY TO A CLASS AND TO AN EXCEEDINGLY SMALL CLASS THE MAJORITY OF MANKIND IT PENS UP IN FILTHY HOVELS AND TENEMENTS TO FEED UPON HUSKS AND ROT IN MISERY THIS WAS ONCE EASY BUT NOW IT IS GROWING HARDERAND THUS LITTLE BY LITTLE THE BOURGEOISIE IS LOSING ITS TEMPER JUST NOW IT IS LIKE A FAT POODLE BY A STOVEYOU THINK IT IS ASLEEP AND VENTURE TO TOUCH IT WHEN QUICK AS A FLASH IT HAS PUT ITS FANGS IN YOU TO THE BONE THE BOURGEOIS CIVILISATION IS IN ONE WORD AN ORGANISED SYSTEM OF REPRESSION IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD IT HAS THE POLICE AND THE MILITIA THE BLUDGEON THE BULLET AND THE JAIL IN THE WORLD OF IDEAS IT HAS THE POLITICAL PLATFORM THE SCHOOL THE COLLEGE THE PRESS THE CHURCHAND LITERATURE THE BOURGEOIS CONTROLS THESE THINGS PRECISELY AS HE CONTROLS THE LABOUR OF SOCIETY BY HIS CONTROL OF THE PURSESTRINGS UNLESS PROPER CANDIDATES ARE NAMED BY POLITICAL PARTIES THERE ARE NO CAMPAIGN FUNDS UNLESS PROPER TEACHERS AND COLLEGE PRESIDENTS ARE CHOSEN THERE ARE NO ENDOWMENTS THUS IT HAPPENS THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT A POLITICAL ECONOMY CAREFULLY DIVORCED NOT MERELY FROM HUMANITY BUT ALSO FROM SCIENCE HISTORY AND SENSE ANY OTHER KIND OF POLITICAL ECONOMY THE STUDENT SOMETIMES DESPISESMORE COMMONLY HE DOES NOT EVEN KNOW THAT IT EXISTS AND IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH THE CHURCHES AND WITH THEOLOGY WE HAVE AT PRESENT ESTABLISHED IN THIS LAND A RELIGION WHICH EXISTS IN THE NAME OF THE WORLDS GREATEST REVOLUTIONIST THE FOUNDER OF THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT THIS MAN DENOUNCED THE BOURGEOIS AND THE BOURGEOIS IDEAL MORE VEHEMENTLY THAN EVER IT HAS SINCE BEEN DENOUNCEDDECLARING IN PLAIN WORDS THAT NO BOURGEOIS COULD GET INTO HEAVEN AND YET HIS CHURCH IS TODAY IN ALL ITS FORMS AND IN EVERY CIVILISED LAND THE MAIN PILLAR OF BOURGEOIS SOCIETY WITH THE PRESS THE BOURGEOIS HAS A STILL MORE DIRECT METHOD THAN ENDOWMENT THE PRESS HE OWNS ALL THE DAILY NEWSPAPERS IN NEW YORK FOR INSTANCE ARE THE PROPERTY OF MILLIONAIRES AND ARE RUN BY THEM IN THEIR OWN INTERESTS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THEIR STABLES OR THEIR CUISINE THAT DOES NOT MEAN OF COURSE THAT MANY OF THEIR JOURNALISTIC MENIALS ARE NOT SINCEREIT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE COLLEGE PRESIDENTS AND CLERGYMEN MAY NOT BE SINCERE ONE OF THE QUAINTEST THINGS ABOUT THE BOURGEOIS EDITOR THE BOURGEOIS COLLEGE PRESIDENT THE BOURGEOIS CLERGYMAN IS THE WHOLESOULED NAVET WITH WHICH HE TAKES IT FOR GRANTED THAT JUST AS ALL CIVILISATION EXISTS FOR THE COMFORT OF THE BOURGEOIS SO ALSO ALL TRUTH MUST NECESSARILY BE SUCH AS THE BOURGEOIS WOULD DESIRE IT TO BE AND THEN THERE IS LITERATURE THE BOURGEOIS RECOGNISES THE NOVELIST AND THE POET AS A MEANS OF AMUSEMENT SOMEWHAT ABOVE THE PROSTITUTE AND ABOUT ON A LEVEL WITH THE MUSICHALL ARTIST HE RECOGNISES THE ESSAYIST THE HISTORIAN AND THE PUBLICIST AS AGENTS OF BOURGEOIS REPRESSION EQUALLY AS NECESSARY AS THE CLERGYMAN AND THE EDITOR TO ALL OF THEM HE GRANTS THE GOOD THINGS OF THE BOURGEOIS LIFE A BOURGEOIS HOME WITH SERVANTS WHO KNOW THEIR PLACES AND A BOURGEOIS CLUB WITH SMILING AND OBSEQUIOUS WAITERS THEY MAY EVEN ON STATE OCCASIONS BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE BOURGEOIS MAGNATES AND TOUCH THE GRACIOUS FINGERS OF THE MAGNATES PUDGY WIVES THERE IS ONLY ONE CONDITION SO OBVIOUS THAT IT HARDLY NEEDS TO BE MENTIONEDTHEY MUST BE BOURGEOIS THEY MUST SEE LIFE FROM THE BOURGEOIS POINT OF VIEW BEYOND THAT THERE IS NOT THE LEAST RESTRICTION THE NOVELIST FOR INSTANCE MAY ROAM THE WHOLE OF SPACE AND TIMETHERE IS NOTHING IN LIFE THAT HE MAY NOT TREAT PROVIDED ONLY THAT HE BE BOURGEOIS IN HIS TREATMENT HE MAY SHOW US THE OLDEN TIME WITH NOBLE DAMES AND GALLANT GENTLEMEN DALLYING WITH GRACEFUL SENTIMENT HE MAY ENTERTAIN US WITH PICTURES OF THE MODERN WORLD MAY DAZZLE US WITH VISIONS OF HIGH SOCIETY IN ALL ITS SPLENDOURS MAY AWE US WITH THE WONDERS OF MODERN CIVILISATION OF STEAM AND ELECTRICITY THE FLYING MACHINE AND THE AUTOMOBILE HE MAY THRILL US WITH BATTLE MURDER AND SHERLOCK HOLMES HE MAY BRING TEARS TO OUR EYES AT THE THOUGHT OF THE OLD FOLKS AT HOME OR AT HIS PICTURES OF THE HONESTY HUMILITY AND SOBRIETY OF THE COMMON MAN HE MAY EVEN GO TO THE SLUMS AND SHOW US THE WAYS OF MRS WIGGS HER PATIENT FRUGALITY AND BEAUTIFUL CONTENTMENT IN THAT STATE OF LIFE TO WHICH IT HAS PLEASED GOD TO CALL HER IN ANY OF THESE FIELDS THE AUTHOR IF HE IS WORTH HIS SALT MAY BE ENTERTAININGAND SO THE ROYALTIES WILL COME IN IF THERE IS ANY ONE WHOM THIS DOES NOT SUITWHO IS SO PERVERSE THAT THE BOURGEOIS DO NOT PLEASE HIM OR SO OBSTINATE THAT HE WILL NOT LEARN TO PLEASE THE BOURGEOISWE SEND AFTER HIM OUR LITERARY POLICEMAN THE BOURGEOIS REVIEWER AND BLUDGEON HIM INTO SILENCE OR BETTER YET WE SIMPLY LEAVE HIM ALONE AND HE MOVES INTO A GARRET THE BOURGEOIS GARRETS RESEMBLE THE BOURGEOIS EXCURSION STEAMERS THEY ARE NEVER SO CROWDED THAT THERE IS NOT ROOM FOR AS MANY MORE AS WANT TO COME ON BOARD AND ANY YOUNG AUTHOR WHO IMAGINES THAT HE CAN BEAR TO STARVE LONGER THAN THE WORLD CAN BEAR TO LET HIM STARVE IS WELCOME TO TRY IT LETTING THINGS STARVE IS THE SPECIALTY OF THE BOURGEOIS SOCIETYTHE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CREATURES IN IT ARE STARVING ALL THE TIME SO MUCH FOR THINGS AS THEY ARE THE REVOLUTION WILL OF COURSE NOT CHANGE OUR PRESENT BOURGEOIS PEOPLEEXCEPT THAT IT WILL SCARE THEM THOROUGHLY AND MAKE THEM TEACHABLE BUT IT WILL BRING TO THE FRONT AN ENORMOUS CLASS OF PEOPLE TO WHOM LIFE IS A NEW AND WONDROUS THING AND THEIR CHILDREN ALSO WILL GROW UP IN A DIFFERENT WORLD AND WITH A DIFFERENT IDEAL AND SO A GENERATION FROM NOW THERE WILL BE A NEW ART PUBLIC THE PEOPLE WHO COMPOSE IT WILL NOT HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CONSIDER MONEY THE ONLY THING IN LIFE THE SOLE TEST OF EXCELLENCE AND POWER THEY WILL NOT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP ON THE MOTTO DO OTHERS OR THEY WILL DO YOU THEY WILL HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN A WORLD IN WHICH NO MAN IS ABLE TO DO ANOTHER MAN AND IN WHICH ALL MEN STAND AS EQUALS AS REGARDS MONEY THEY WILL HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN A WORLD IN WHICH WORK AND A DECENT LIFE ARE THE RIGHT AND DUTY OF EVERY MAN AND ARE TAKEN FOR GRANTED WITH EVERY MAN IN WHICH INFLUENCE REPUTATION AND COMMAND ARE GIVEN FOR OTHER THINGS THAN MONEY IF IT BE TRUE THAT FAITH HOPE AND CHARITY ARE GREATER THINGS THAN WEALTH IT IS PERHAPS NOT ALTOGETHER UTOPIAN TO SUPPOSE THAT THESE WILL BE THE THINGS THAT THE NEW PUBLIC WILL HONOUR AND WILL CONTRIVE TO PROMOTE THE BEST WAY IN WHICH ONE CAN BE SURE ABOUT THIS IS TO STUDY THE WRITERS WHO ARE SHAPING THE IDEALS OF SOCIALISMSUCH MEN AS WHITMAN AND THOREAU RUSKIN AND WILLIAM MORRIS KROPOTKIN AND CARPENTER AND GORKY ABOVE ALL I WISH THAT I COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THE READERS LOOKING INTO ONE BOOK IN WHICH ONE OF THE MASTERSPIRITS OF OUR TIME HAS MADE AN ATTEMPT TO PICTURE THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD THAT IS TO BE WHEN I MET MR H G WELLS LAST YEAR I HAD NOT READ ANY OF HIS BOOKS SO HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS MODERN UTOPIA GRACIOUSLY INSCRIBING IT TO THE MOST HOPEFUL OF SOCIALISTS FROM THE NEXT MOST HOPEFUL AFTERWARD I WAS ASKED BY LIFE TO NAME THE BOOK WHICH HAD GIVEN ME THE MOST PLEASURE DURING THE LAST YEAR AND I NAMED THIS ONE IT IS IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE GREAT WORKS OF OUR LITERATURE IT IS WORTHY TO BE PLACED WITH THE VISIONS OF PLATO AND SIR THOMAS MORE IT HAS THREE GREAT VIRTUES WHICH ARE RARELY IF EVER FOUND IN COMBINATION IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS CHARACTERISED BY A NOBILITY AND LOFTINESS OF SPIRIT WHICH MAKES ITS READING A RELIGIOUS EXERCISE IN THE SECOND PLACE IT IS THE WORK OF AN ENGINEER A MAN WITH THE MODERN SENSE OF REALITY AND ACQUAINTED WITH THE WHOLE FIELD OF SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENT IN THE THIRD PLACE IT IS WRITTEN IN A A LITERARY STYLE WHICH MAKES THE READING OF EACH PARAGRAPH A DELIGHT IN ITSELF IT IS A BOOK TO LOVE AND TO CHERISH ONE LEAVES IT REFRESHED AND STRENGTHENED TO WAIT WITH PATIENCE AND CHEERFULNESS THE HOUR OF THE GREAT CHANGE CHAPTER VIII THE COPERATIVE HOME IN ALL THAT I HAVE OUTLINED CONCERNING THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC I HAVE TRIED TO INDICATE MY BELIEF THAT IT WILL BE THE CREATION OF NO MANS WILL BUT A PRODUCT OF EVOLUTIONTHE RESULT OF MANY FORCES WHICH ARE NOW AT WORK IN OUR SOCIETY THESE FORCES WE CAN STUDY AND ANALYSE AND IN PICTURING THEIR FINAL PRODUCT WE ARE NOT SIMPLY INDULGING IN FANTASTIC SPECULATION BUT ARE MAKING SCIENTIFIC DEDUCTIONS I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE NOW IN OUR PRESENT WORLD THE HALFDEVELOPED EMBRYO OF EVERYTHING WHICH I HAVE PICTURED IN THE FUTURE THE REVOLUTION WHICH COMES SUDDENLY AND IN THE MIDST OF STRAIN AND AGONY IS PRECISELY THE PARALLEL OF A CHILDBIRTH IN OUR PRESENT TRUSTS FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE PERFECT EXAMPLES OF THE CENTRALISING AND SYSTEMATISING OF PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION ABSOLUTELY THE ONLY THING NEEDED TO FIT THEM INTO THE WORLD I HAVE PICTURED IS A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP AGAIN IN THE LABOUR UNIONS WE SEE THE BUILDING UP OF THE MACHINERY OF INDUSTRIAL SELFGOVERNMENT AND SIMILARLY IN OUR CHURCHES AND CLUBS OUR BENEVOLENT AND ARTISTIC AND SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATIONS WE HAVE THE GERMS OF ALL THE COPERATIVE ACTIVITIES OF THE FUTURE IN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WE HAVE A COMPLETE AND PERFECT PIECE OF PRACTICAL SOCIALISM READY TO FIT INTO THE STRUCTURE OF OUR INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC IN OUR POST OFFICE WE HAVE STILL ANOTHER WHILE IN THE ARMY AND NAVY WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF INDUSTRIAL PATERNALISM WHICH NEED ONLY THE BREATH OF A NEW IDEAL TO MAKE THEM INDISPENSABLE FOR ALL TIME WE SAW AFTER THE SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE THE REAL USE OF STANDING ARMIES AND FOR SUCH PURPOSES THEY WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST LONG AFTER WAR SHALL HAVE BECOME A NIGHTMARE MEMORY IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME THAT IN CONCLUDING MY ARGUMENT IT MIGHT BE WELL TO TELL OF ANOTHER SUCH SEED OF THE FUTURE IN THE PLANTING OF WHICH I MYSELF HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF ASSISTING I REFER TO THE HELICON HOME COLONY AT ENGLEWOOD NEW JERSEY WHERE I HAVE BEEN LIVING WHILE WRITING THIS BOOK OUR INDUSTRIES ARE ORGANISED AT PRESENT UNDER THE COMPETITIVE SYSTEM AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY COPERATIVE METHOD OF PRODUCTION CAN DRIVE HUMAN BEINGS TO THE SAME PITCH OF EFFORT AS THEY ARE DRIVEN BY THE LASH OF WAGESLAVERY SO I CONSIDER THAT ANY FORM OF COPERATION IN PRODUCTION IS DOOMED TO FAILURE UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS AND I SHOULD PREFER TO WATCH FROM THE OUTSIDE ANY ATTEMPT TO FOUND COLONIES OF THE BROOK FARM AND RUSKIN TYPE THE CASE IS QUITE OTHERWISE HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO COPERATION IN DISTRIBUTION IN THE EXPENDITURE OF ONES INCOME WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH HUNDREDS OF FORMS OF THAT SORT OF ASSOCIATIONCOPERATIVE STORES BENEVOLENT FRATERNITIES SOCIAL CLUBS AND CHURCHES THE PRACTICABILITY OF ANY SUCH ENTERPRISE DEPENDS UPON TWO QUESTIONS FIRST ARE THERE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WANT THE SAME THING AND SECOND CAN THEY GET IT MORE EFFECTIVELY IN COMBINATION THAN OTHERWISE THE IDEA OF COPERATION IN DOMESTIC INDUSTRY HAS BEEN WELL WORKED OUT IN THEORYNOTABLY IN MRS GILMANS BOOK THE HOME THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO REALISE IT IN PRACTICE SO FAR AS I KNOW IS THE HELICON HOME COLONY THE PLAN WAS BROACHED IN AN ARTICLE WHICH I PUBLISHED IN THE INDEPENDENT IN JUNE OF IN THE COURSE OF THE ARTICLE I OUTLINED THE SITUATION AS FOLLOWS HERE AM I ON MY LITTLE FARM LIVING AS MY ANCESTORS LIVEDLIKE A CAVE MAN OR A FEUDAL BARON I HAVE MY LITTLE CASTLE AND MY RETAINERS AND DEPENDANTS TO ATTEND ME AND WE PRACTISE A HUNDRED DIFFERENT TRADES THE TRADE OF SERVING MEALS AND THE TRADE OF CLEANING DISHES THE TRADE OF WASHING AND IRONING CLOTHES OF KILLING AND DRESSING MEAT OF CHURNING BUTTER OF BAKING BREAD OF GRINDING MEAL OF RAISING CHICKENS OF CUTTING WOOD OF PRESERVING FRUIT OF HEATING A HOUSE OF DECORATING ROOMS OF TRAINING CHILDREN AND OF WRITING BOOKS AND ALL THESE CROWDED INTO ONE ESTABLISHMENT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY AND ALL JARRING AND CLASHING WITH EACH OTHER AND ALL CARRIED ON IN THE MOST PRIMITIVE AND BARBAROUS FASHION UPON A SMALL SCALE AND BY UNSKILLED HAND LABOUR IT TAKES A HUNDRED COOKS TO PREPARE A HUNDRED MEALS BADLY WHILE TWENTY COOKS COULD PREPARE ONE MEAL FOR A HUNDRED FAMILIES AND DO IT PERFECTLY IT COSTS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUILD AND EQUIP A HUNDRED KITCHENS IT WOULD COST ONLY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUILD ONE KITCHEN BUT OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE LARGESCALE COOKING AT PRESENT YOU CAN ONLY HAVE IT UNDER CAPITALIST AUSPICES AND SO IT IS ASSOCIATED IN YOUR MINDS WITH UNCLEANNESS AND BAD SERVICE AND HIGH PRICES IT TAKES A HUNDRED CHURNS AND A HUNDRED ACHING BACKS TO MAKE A THOUSAND POUNDS OF BUTTER IT WOULD TAKE ONLY ONE MACHINE AND A MAN TO TEND IT TO MAKE THE SAME THOUSAND POUNDS AND THE COST OF MAKING IT WOULD BE CUT NINETYFIVE PER CENT BUT OF COURSE YOU CANNOT HAVE LARGESCALE BUTTERMAKING EXCEPT IT IS DONE FOR PROFITAND THAT MEANS ADULTERATION AND POISONING IT TAKES A HUNDRED IGNORANT NURSEMAIDS TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN OF A HUNDRED FAMILIES AND DEVELOP EVERY KIND OF UGLINESS AND BADNESS IN THEM IT WOULD TAKE ONLY TWENTY OR THIRTY TRAINED NURSES AND KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS TO TAKE CARE OF THEM COPERATIVELY AND BRING THEM UP ACCORDING TO THE TEACHINGS OF SCIENCE ONE COULD SHOW THIS SAME THING IN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT FORMS IF IT WERE NECESSARY BUT IT HAS ALL BEEN REASONED OUT IN CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMANS BOOK THE HOME AND ANYONE TO WHOM THE IDEA IS NEW MAY READ IT THERE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS NOT TO PERSUADE ANYONE BUT TO MOVE TO ACTION THOSE ALREADY PERSUADED THERE MUST BE IN AND NEAR NEW YORK THOUSANDS OF MEN AND WOMEN OF LIBERAL SYMPATHIES WHO UNDERSTAND THIS SITUATION CLEARLY AND ARE HANDICAPPED BY ITS MISERIES IN THEIR OWN LIVESAUTHORS ARTISTS AND MUSICIANS EDITORS AND TEACHERS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN WHO ABHOR BOARDING HOUSES AND APARTMENT HOTELS AND YET SHRINK FROM MANAGING SERVANTS WHO HAVE LONELY AND PEEVISH CHILDREN LIKE MY OWN AND ARE NO FONDER OF EATING POISONS OR OF WASTING THEIR TIME AND STRENGTH THAN I AM THERE MUST BE A FEW WHO LIKE MYSELF HAVE REALISED THAT IT IS A QUESTION OF DRAGGING THROUGH LIFE A CONSTANTLY INCREASING BURDEN OF CARE OR MAKING AN INTELLIGENT EFFORT AND SOLVING THE PROBLEM ONCE FOR ALL TO SUCH I OFFER MY COPERATION I AM NOT A BUSINESS MAN BUT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE FORCED ME TO TAKE UP THIS PROBLEM AND I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO FAILING IN WHAT I UNDERTAKE I HAVE SAID THAT SOCIALISM IS NOT AN EXPERIMENT IN GOVERNMENT BUT AN ACT OF WILL AND I SAY THE SAME OF THIS PLAN HAVING GOTTEN THE FIGURES FROM EXPERTS AND FOUND OUT EXACTLY WHAT WE CAN DO THE ONE THING REMAINING IS TO GO AHEAD AND DO IT I SUPPOSE THAT THE AVERAGE PROFESSIONAL MAN INVESTS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A HOME OR ELSE PAYS RENT EQUAL TO INTEREST UPON THAT SUM AND THAT HE PAYS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR LIVING EXPENSES FOR HIS FAMILY LET A HUNDRED SUCH FAMILIES COMBINE TO FOUND A COPERATIVE HOME AND THERE WOULD BE A MILLION DOLLARS FOR BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR RUNNING EXPENSES I BELIEVE THAT FOR HALF THE OUTLAY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE COULD LIVE AND ENJOY COMFORTS AT PRESENT POSSIBLE ONLY TO MILLIONAIRES I HAVE HOWEVER NO INTENTION OF ASKING ANYONE TO RISK HIS MONEY UPON SUCH A GUESS I WRITE THIS TO FIND OUT IF THERE ARE PEOPLE DISPOSED TO CONSIDER THE PROJECT AND IF THERE ARE ENOUGH I WILL HAVE THE PLAN FIGURED UPON BY ARCHITECTS CONTRACTORS STEWARDS AND OTHER QUALIFIED EXPERTS AND HAVE PREPARED A DEFINITE BUSINESS PROPOSITION AND A PLAN OF ORGANISATION FOR A STOCK COMPANY THE FOLLOWING EMBODIES MY OWN CONCEPTION OF WHAT SUCH A HOME COLONY SHOULD BE IT WOULD BE LOCATED WITHIN AN HOUR OF NEW YORK AND WOULD HAVE ONE HUNDRED FAMILIES AND THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED ACRES OF LAND HEALTHFULLY LOCATED NEAR SOME BODY OF WATER AND AS UNSPOILED BY THE HAND OF MAN AS POSSIBLE IT SHOULD HAVE AN ABUNDANT WATER SUPPLY AND A FILTERING PLANT AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER PLANT AND A LARGE GARDEN AND FARM RAISING ITS OWN STOCK MEAT POULTRY FRUIT AND VEGETABLES AND CANNING THE LAST FOR WINTER USE IT SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS SALARIED EXPERTS SHOULD BE EMPLOYED MACHINERY SHOULD BE INSTALLED WHEREVER IT COULD BE MADE TO PAY AND THE BEST MODERN METHODS SHOULD BE APPLIED IN EVERY INDUSTRY ALL ITS PURCHASES SHOULD BE IN BULK AND TESTED FOR QUALITY AND SO FAR AS THE PREPARATION AND SERVING OF FOOD IS CONCERNED THE PROCESSES SHOULD BE KEPT AS ASEPTIC AS A SURGICAL OPERATION WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING OUR BUILDINGS FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES ENDOWED BY PERSONS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND FEW IDEALS AND SO WE CONSUME MUCH SPACE AND MATERIAL AND ACCOMPLISH LITTLE EXACTLY TYPIFYING OUR CIVILISATION THE BUILDINGS OF THIS HOME COLONY SHOULD BE OF FRAME AT THE OUTSET OF SIMPLE AND EXPRESSIVE DESIGN EACH STRUCTURE EXACTLY ADAPTED TO ITS SPECIFIC PURPOSE THE BUILDINGS SHOULD BE CONVENIENTLY GROUPEDTHOSE FOR THE CHILDREN IN ONE PLACE THOSE FOR COOKING AND EATING IN ANOTHER THOSE FOR READING FOR MUSIC AND SOCIAL INTERCOURSE FOR RECREATION AND EXERCISE IN STILL OTHER PLACES THE GREATER PART OF THE LAND WOULD OF COURSE BE GIVEN UP TO FARM AND WOODLAND AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS OF THE FAMILIES THE GROUND AVAILABLE FOR THIS LATTER PURPOSE SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO LOTS PRICED ACCORDING TO SIZE AND LOCATION AND EASED TO STOCKHOLDERS FOR LONG TERMS EACH WOULD ERECT HIS OWN HOME ACCORDING TO HIS OWN TASTEA HOME OF COURSE OF A KIND HITHERTO UNKNOWN WITH NO PROVISION FOR THE COOKING OF FOOD OR THE TRAINING OF CHILDREN OR OTHER TRADES AND PROFESSIONS IT WOULD BE A PLACE WHERE THE FAMILY MET TO REST AND PLAY AND SLEEP IT MIGHT BE LARGE OR SMALL ANYTHING THAT THE OWNER CHOSE TO MAKE ITMY OWN WOULD BE A FOUR OR FIVEROOM COTTAGE OF RUSTIC DESIGN AND IT WOULD COST FROM SIX TO EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS BESIDES THESE THERE SHOULD BE APARTMENT BUILDINGS OWNED BY THE COLONY AND DORMITORIES WITH ROOMS FOR SINGLE MEN AND WOMEN AS TO THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS THERE SHOULD BE A LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL DINING HALL AND A MODERN SCIENTIFICALLY CONSTRUCTED KITCHEN THERE SHOULD BE SEPARATE TABLES FOR EACH FAMILY OR FOR CONGENIAL GROUPS OF PEOPLE THE SERVICE SHOULD BE UNEXCEPTIONABLE THE FOOD SIMPLE BUT PERFECT IN QUALITY AND PREPARATION THERE SHOULD BE A VEGETARIAN SERVICE FOR THOSE WHO PREFER THIS CHEAPER MODE OF LIFE AND THE CHARGE FOR BOARD SHOULD BE BASED UPON THE COST OF THE SERVICE AS TO WHAT THE COST WOULD BE WITH A COLONY RAISING NEARLY ALL ITS OWN FOOD UPON THE PREMISES I CAN ONLY SUBMIT THREE EXPERIENCES OF MY OWN FIRST IT COST ME FOR MY FAMILY OF THREE TO BOARD IN NEW YORK CITY IN ONE ROOM AND IN THE CHEAPEST WAY A THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SECOND IT COST US LIVING IN A THREEROOM COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRY DOING OUR OWN WORK AND BUYING OUR FOOD FROM A FARMER AT WHOLESALE PRICES SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR THIRD IT COST US LIVING UPON A SIXTYACRE FARM WHICH REPRESENTED A TOTAL INVESTMENT OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS DOING NO WORK OURSELVES BUT THE MANAGING PAYING A MAN AND WOMAN FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS A YEAR HAVING A HORSE AND CARRIAGE AND FEEDING FIVE PERSONS INSTEAD OF THREE A TOTAL OF LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR LEST THIS SHOULD BE UNBELIEVABLE I PUT IT IN ANOTHER FORMTHE TOTAL EXPENSES OF THE FARM INCLUDING LABOUR WERE LESS THAN TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THE INCOME WAS SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THE NET LOSS OR THE COST TO US OF A YEARS LIVING WAS LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED AND THESE FIGURES IT SHOULD BE EXPLAINED INCLUDED NOT MERELY BOARD BUT ALSO HOUSEHOLD SUPPLIES AND REPAIRS OF ALL SORTS ITEMS WHICH WOULD APPEAR IN OTHER PLACES IN THE COMMUNITYS ACCOUNTS I WILL PROBABLY BE LAUGHED AT BUT I BELIEVE THAT GRANTING THE LAND HORSES AND MACHINERY BUILDINGS EQUIPMENT AND CAPITAL THE MEMBERS OF SUCH A COLONY AS I DESCRIBE COULD BE PROVIDED WITH PERFECT SERVICE AND AN ABUNDANCE OF FOOD OF THE BEST QUALITY AT A TOTAL COST OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR PER PERSON SO MUCH FOR THE COPERATIVE PREPARATION OF FOOD AND NOW FOR THE CARING FOR CHILDREN THERE SHOULD BE TWO SEPARATE ESTABLISHMENTS ONE FOR INFANTS WHO LIKE TO SLEEP AND ONE FOR CHILDREN WHO LIKE TO RUN AND SHOUT BOTH SHOULD BE SCIENTIFICALLY CONSTRUCTED AND VENTILATED AND KEPT AS CLEAN AS AN UPTODATE HOSPITAL THE FOOD SHOULD BE PREPARED UNDER THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF A PHYSICIAN NO BUILDING FOR CHILDREN SHOULD BE OVER TWO STORIES HIGH AND THE UPPER WINDOWS SHOULD BE BEYOND THE REACH OF CHILDREN NO MATCHES OR EXPOSED FIRE SHOULD BE PERMITTED AND THERE SHOULD BE A NIGHT WATCHMAN FIRE EXTINGUISHERS AND AN AUTOMATIC SPRINKLING APPARATUS THESE ESTABLISHMENTS SHOULD BE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A BOARD OF WOMEN DIRECTORS AND THE ACTUAL WORK OF CARING FOR THE CHILDREN WASHING DRESSING AND FEEDING THEM PLAYING WITH THEM AND TEACHING THEM SHOULD BE DONE BY TRAINED NURSES AND KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS WHO LIVE IN THE COLONY AS THE FRIENDS AND SOCIAL EQUALS OF ITS MEMBERS IN OTHER WORDS IT IS MY IDEA THAT THE CARING FOR CHILDREN SHOULD BE RECOGNISED AS A PROFESSION AND THAT SERVANTS SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT IT IS MY IDEA THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE IN A PLACE BUILT FOR THE PURPOSE WITH FLOORS FOR BABIES TO CRAWL WHERE THERE IS NO DIRT FOR THEM TO EAT WITH PLAYGROUNDS FOR CHILDREN WHERE THERE ARE NO STOVES AND NO BOILING WATER NO STAIRCASES AND WELLS NO CATS AND DOGS NO WORKBASKETS LAMPS PIANOS SEWING MACHINES JAM CLOSETS INKSTANDS AND AUTHORS WRITING TABLES INSTEAD THERE SHOULD BE SLEEPING ROOMS AND BEDROOMS AND SUN PARLOURS FOR NURSING MOTHERS A SEPARATE BUILDING FOR THE SICK KINDERGARTEN ROOMS AND INDOOR PLAYGROUNDS FOR BAD WEATHER AND A BIG ALLOUTDOORS ROMPING GROUND WITH SUNNY PLACES AND SHADY PLACES SWINGS ROCKING HORSES SAND PILES AND ALL OTHER ACCESSORIES OF A CHILDRENS HEAVEN OF COURSE ANY MOTHER SHOULD COME AND PLAY WITH OR CARE FOR HER OWN CHILDREN JUST AS MUCH AS SHE PLEASED OR TAKE THEM HOME AS SHE CHOSE THOUGH I THINK THAT NO ONE WOULD CARE TO ASSIST THIS PLAN WHO DID NOT BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE CARED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE AND PRESERVED FROM THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF GRANDMOTHERS AND AUNTS OF COURSE ANY MOTHER WHO BELIEVED THAT HER WORK IN THE WORLD WAS CARING FOR CHILDREN AND WHO WISHED TO CARE FOR HER OWN AND OTHERS ACCORDING TO THE METHODS OF THE COMMONWEALTH WOULD BE FREE TO DO SO AND TO EARN HER LIVING BY DOING IT I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED THAT I SHOULD NOT REGARD THIS AS AN EXPERIMENT IN SOCIALISM BUT I DO THINK THAT THOSE WHO UNDERTOOK IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IN SYMPATHY WITH THE SPIRIT OF SOCIALISM WHICH IS THE SPIRIT OF BROTHERHOOD AND DEMOCRACY WHENEVER I HAVE MENTIONED THIS PLAN TO FRIENDS THEY HAVE ALWAYS SAID THE GREAT DIFFICULTY WOULD BE TO GET TOGETHER A COMMUNITY OF CONGENIAL PEOPLE IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME THAT THIS WOULD BE A DIFFICULTY AT ALL EVERY MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE HIS OWN HOME TO WHICH HE WOULD INVITE HIS PERSONAL FRIENDS AS HE CHOSE AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY HE WOULD MEET IN THE SAME WAY THAT HE MEETS ACQUAINTANCES IN BUSINESS AND POLITICS IN THEATRES RESTAURANTS AND CLUBS I MYSELF AM THE MOST UNSOCIABLE OF HUMAN BEINGS WHEN I AM BUSY AND HAVE NO IDEA OF GIVING UP MY HERMITS TASTES IN A COLONY OF A HUNDRED FAMILIES THERE OUGHT TO BE PERSONS OF EVERY KIND OF INCLINATION AND IT WOULD NOT BE IN THE LEAST NECESSARY FOR ANYONE TO ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE WHO WERE NOT CONGENIAL OF COURSE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHOM WE SHOULD NOT WANT NEAR US AT ALL BUT SUCH PEOPLE I THINK WOULD NOT CARE TO JOIN OUR COLONY VULGAR AND SNOBBISH PEOPLE GET ALONG VERY WELL IN THE WORLD AS IT IS AND DO NOT FIND IT A TASK TO GIVE ORDERS TO SERVANTS THOSE WHO WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SUCH A PLAN WOULD BE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WISHED TO PRACTISE PLAIN LIVING AND HIGH THINKING AND THEY WOULD NATURALLY WISH TO GET AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM EVERY SUGGESTION OF OSTENTATION AND CONVENTIONALITY THEY WOULD ESTABLISH THE SHIRTWAIST AND THE SHORT SKIRT AS EN RGLE AND WOULD I TRUST ALLOW ME IN WITHOUT A DRESS SUIT THEY WOULD BE ALL HARDWORKING PEOPLE THEMSELVES AND THEY WOULD NOT LOOK DOWN UPON HONEST LABOUR THIS SPIRIT IF WISELY AND EARNESTLY CULTIVATED WOULD SOLVE THE SERVANT PROBLEM FOR THE COLONY AND SOLVE THE HEALTH PROBLEM FOR ITS MEMBERS AS WELL I KNOW BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN WHO WHEN THEY NEED EXERCISE HAVE TO GO DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT AND LIFT WEIGHTS AND PULL AT RUBBER STRAPS AND THEY ENVY ME MY FARM WHERE I CAN HOE THE GARDEN OR PITCH HAY OR PICK FRUIT AND NOT MERELY BENEFIT MY BODY BUT ALSO PUT MONEY IN MY PURSE IN THIS COMMUNITY EVERY MEMBER WOULD BE CREDITED FOR THE TIME HE WORKED AND IT OUGHT TO BECOME THE CUSTOM FOR THE MEN TO HELP WITH THE HARVESTS AND THE WOMEN WITH THE PRESERVING OF FRUIT AND THE CHILDREN WITH THE BERRY PICKING AND THE WEEDING OF THE GARDENS I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN NEW YORK CITY STUDENTS OF ART AND MUSIC AND THE PROFESSIONS WHO WOULD BE GLAD OF A CHANCE TO EARN THEIR WAY IN A COMMUNITY WHERE CLASS FEELING DID NOT MAKE LABOUR DEGRADING I APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF SUCH A PROJECT THE CHANCES AT PRESENT ARE AGAINST A COALHEAVERS BEING A SOCIALLY POSSIBLE PERSON AND I AM NOT INSISTING THAT THE DAY LABOURERS SHOULD SHARE IN THE PRIVILEGES OF THE COMMUNITY BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS SHOULD CERTAINLY BE THE CASE WITH THOSE WHOM WE SELECT TO CARE FOR AND TEACH OUR CHILDREN AND ALSO IF POSSIBLE WITH THOSE WHOM WE PERMIT TO PREPARE AND SERVE OUR FOOD IF I AM NOT WILLING TO SHAKE A MANS HAND OR SIT NEXT TO HIM IN A READINGROOM I DO NOT SEE WHY I SHOULD BE WILLING TO EAT WHAT HE HAS COOKED I PERSONALLY KNOW A YOUNG MAN WHO IS STUDYING ART AND WHO EARNS HIS LIVING BY WASHING DISHES IN A DOWNTOWN RESTAURANT BECAUSE IT TAKES ONLY TWO OR THREE HOURS A DAY OF HIS TIME IN MEMORIAL HALL AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY IN THE SANITARIUM AT BATTLE CREEK AND IN MANY OTHER PLACES I MIGHT NAME THOSE WHO WAIT UPON THE TABLES ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND ANYONE WHO KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE WHICH THERE IS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF SUCH A DINING HALL KNOWS WHAT I SHOULD WISH TO ATTAIN THE ABOVE ARTICLE BROUGHT ME REPLIES FROM FOUR OR FIVE HUNDRED PERSONS AND COMMITTEES WERE NAMED WHICH MET ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS OF THE PLAN IN OCTOBER OF THE SAME YEAR THE PURCHASE OF HELICON HALL WAS MADE AND THE COLONY BEGAN ITS CAREER SIX MONTHS AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF MY FIRST ARTICLE I CONTRIBUTED TO THE INDEPENDENT AN ACCOUNT OF HOW THE EXPERIMENT WAS SUCCEEDING I QUOTE FROM IT THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS WE MADE MANY MISTAKES I SHALL TELL ABOUT SOME OF THEM IN DUE COURSE FOR THE BENEFIT OF FUTURE PIONEERS BUT THERE IS ONE THING TO BE SAID HERE AT THE START WE MADE NO MISTAKE IN BELIEVING IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IT WAS A POINT ABOUT WHICH THE CRITICS OF OUR PLAN WERE ALL AGREED THAT IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY WORK BECAUSE PEOPLE COULD NEVER DECIDE WHAT THEY WANTED THAT DREADFUL BUGABOO CALLED HUMAN NATURE WOULD WRECK US IN THE END I FOR MY PART BELIEVED THAT PEOPLE IN AMERICA WERE USED TO THE METHODS OF MAJORITY GOVERNMENT AND I BELIEVED THAT IF WE SHOULD APPLY THOSE SAME METHODS IN A COPERATIVE HOME A GROUP OF INTELLIGENT AND SINCERE PEOPLE COULD MANAGE TO SOLVE ALL THEIR PROBLEMS FROM THE BEGINNING OUR POLICY WAS PUBLICITY AND DEMOCRACY AND FROM THE BEGINNING IT BROUGHT US THROUGH AT THE COMMITTEE MEETINGS EVERYONE HAD HIS SAY AND LITTLE BY LITTLE YOU WOULD SEE A MAJORITY OPINION TAKING SHAPE ON THE QUESTION AT ISSUE UNTIL FINALLY WHEN ALL HAD BEEN HEARD THE MATTER WAS PUT TO A VOTE THERE WAS NO CASE WHERE THE MINORITY DID NOT GIVE WAY WITH ALL COURTESY AND NOW THAT THE COLONY REALLY EXISTS WE SIT ROUND THE FIRESIDE AND TALK OUT OUR QUESTIONS AND AS A RULE WE DO NOT EVEN HAVE TO TAKE A VOTEAN INFORMAL DISCUSSION IS ENOUGH TO MAKE CLEAR TO EVERYONE WHAT IS FAIR AND RIGHT I AM A BELIEVER IN THE MATERIALISTIC CONCEPTION OF HISTORY I AM ACCUSTOMED TO INTERPRET THE CHARACTERS OF MEN FROM THIS POSITIONTO SAY THAT COMPETITION HAS MADE THEM SELFISH AND DECEITFUL AND THAT COPERATION WILL MAKE THEM BEAUTIFUL AND SINCERE I THINK THAT I CAN SEE IT WORKING OUT IN THIS COLONY WE HAVE FOUNDED IT UPON JUSTICE AND TRUTH SOCIALLY WE STAND UPON TERMS OF EQUALITY AND ECONOMICALLY WE PAY FOR EXACTLY WHAT WE GET THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES WE HAVE BUILT UPON AND ALL TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED AND NO OTHER IDEA EVER ENTERS THEIR THOUGHT ILLUSTRATION PHOTOGRAPH BY JESSIE TARBOX BEALS N Y HELICON HALL BUT WILL THIS LAST YOU ASK I DO NOT SEE HOW IT CAN FAIL TO LAST AND TO GROWADMITTING OF COURSE THAT MY ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSE IS CORRECT WE DID NOT START OUT WITH ANY ENTHUSIASMS AND RELIGIOUS ECSTASIES WE HAD SIMPLY COLD COMMON SENSE WE EMPLOYED LAWYERS AND BUSINESS MEN TO PUT US ON A SOUND BASIS OUR ONLY REAL PERIL WAS AT THE BEGINNING BEFORE THE COLONY SPIRIT WAS WELL DEVELOPED IN OUR MEMBERS AND SOME OF US WERE TIRED AND OVERWORKED AND EVEN THEN THERE WERE NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT A LITTLE DISCUSSION COULD NOT CLEAR UP NOW THINGS ARE BEGINNING TO RUN SMOOTHLY AND WE ARE REALISING SOME OF THE BENEFITS WE ARE AS YET IN OUR INFANCY OF COURSE THERE IS NO ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IN WHICH WE DO NOT INTEND TO MAKE NUMEROUS IMPROVEMENTS BUT WE HAVE GOT OVER THE ROUGHEST PARTS OF THE ROAD AND WE CAN BEGIN TO LOOK ABOUT US A LITTLE WE ARE LIVING IN WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SUBURBAN TOWN NEAR NEW YORK WE HAVE NINE AND A HALF ACRES OF LAND SLOPING DOWN FROM THE WESTERN BROW OF THE PALISADES AND COMMANDING A VIEW OF THIRTY MILES AND WE HAVE ONLY HALF A MILE TO WALK TO COME OUT UPON THE HUDSON WHERE THERE IS SCENERY WHICH TOURISTS WOULD TRAVEL MANY MILES TO LOOK AT IF THEY ONLY KNEW ABOUT IT THE HALL ITSELF HAS NEARLY SIX THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF FLOOR SPACE ON THE GROUND FLOOR ALONE DEVOTED TO ROOMS FOR SOCIAL PURPOSES THERE IS A CENTRAL COURT FILLED WITH PALMS AND RUBBER TREES WHICH HAVE GROWN TO THE VERY TOP OF THE THREESTORY BUILDING WE HAVE A LARGE PIPEORGAN A SWIMMING POOL AND BOWLING ALLEY A THEATRE AND A BILLIARD ROOM WE HAVE THIRTYFIVE BEDROOMS RANGED IN GALLERIES ABOUT THE COURT SO THAT WE CAN LOOK OUT OF OUR WINDOWS IN THE MORNING AND SEE THE SUN RISE AND THEN LOOK OUT OF OUR DOOR AND SEE THE TROPICS WE HAVE THE FINEST HEATING SYSTEM IN THE WORLDWE PUMP FRESH AIR IN FROM OUTSIDE HEAT IT IN A THREETHOUSANDFOOT STEAM COIL AND THEN DISTRIBUTE IT TO ALL THE ROOMS WITH THE RESULT THAT WE FEEL AS WELL ALL THE TIME AS OTHER PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY TAKE A TRIP TO ARIZONA OR THE ADIRONDACKS IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS WE HAVE A COMFORTABLE BEDROOM OR STUDY WHERE WE CAN GO AND BE BY OURSELVES AND NEVER BE DISTURBED FOR A WEEK AND DOWNSTAIRS WE HAVE A HUGE FIREPLACE WHERE IF WE HAPPEN TO FEEL IN A SOCIABLE HUMOUR WE CAN SIT AND TALK WITH OUR FRIENDS AND ALSO WE HAVE A DININGROOM WHERE A GROUP OF CULTIVATED PEOPLE MEET THREE TIMES A DAY TO PARTAKE OF WHOLESOME AND PLEASANTTASTING FOOD PREPARED BY OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR BIG FAMILY WHOSE CLEANLINESS AND HONESTY ARE MATTERS OF COMMON KNOWLEDGE TO US THIS LASTNAMED PRIVILEGE COSTS US A WEEK OR IF WE ONLY EAT TWO MEALS AND WE DO NOT HAVE TO ADD TO THIS PRICE ANY CARE OR WORRY BECAUSE THE PRICE INCLUDES THE SALARY OF A SUPERINTENDENT AND A MANAGER WHO WORK SIXTEEN HOURS A DAY EACH TO STRAIGHTEN OUT ALL THE KINKS AND KEEP THE MACHINE RUNNING FINALLY THIS MAGICAL BUILDING CONTAINS A DORMITORY AND A CHILDRENS DININGROOM AND PLAYROOM WHERE TEN HAPPY AND HEALTHY CHILDREN RECEIVE THEIR LESSONS IN PRACTICAL COPERATION AT A COST OF FOUR DOLLARS A WEEK FOR EACH CHILD IT WAS OVER THESE INSTITUTIONALISED INFANTS OF OURS THAT THE CRITICS OF OUR PLAN WERE MOST INCENSED SEVERAL DEAR LADIES WHO HAD READ MY BOOKS AND CONCEIVED A LIKING FOR ME SAT DOWN AND WROTE ME TEARFUL LETTERS TO POINT OUT THE WICKEDNESS OF SEPARATING THE MOTHER FROM HER CHILDREN AS A MATTER OF FACT WE HAVE FIVE MOTHERS IN THE COLONY AND THE WORK OF CARING FOR THE CHILDREN IS DIVIDED AMONG FOUR OF THEM THE FIFTH IS STUDYING MEDICINE IN NEW YORK BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF COMBINING THE CARE OF THE TEN CHILDREN WE ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING RESULTS FIRST THE LABOUR AND TROUBLE OF CARING FOR EACH CHILD IS REDUCED ABOUT TWOTHIRDS SECOND THE CHILD HAS PLAYMATES AND IS HAPPY ALL DAY LONG THIRD WE CAN AFFORD TO KEEP THE CHILD IN A MORE HYGIENIC PLACE THAN THE AVERAGE NURSERYWE HAVE A PUMP DRIVING FRESH AIR INTO HIS PLAYROOM ALL DAY AND FOURTH WE CAN DISPENSE WITH THE SERVICES OF NURSE MAIDS AND GO AWAY LEAVING THE CHILD IN THE CARE OF A FRIEND OF COURSE WE CANNOT HAVE EVERYTHING THAT WE SHOULD LIKE IN THE CHILDRENS DEPARTMENT WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR MORE COLONISTS FOR THAT WITH ONLY TEN CHILDREN WE HAVE TO DISPENSE WITH A RESIDENT PHYSICIAN WE CANNOT EVEN AFFORD A KINDERGARTEN AND OF COURSE WE HAVE NOT THE SCIENTIFICALLY CONSTRUCTED DORMITORY OF WHICH WE DREAM WE HAVE ONLY A CONVERTED THEATRE AND INSTEAD OF THE UNIFORM COTS AND THE DUSTPROOF WALLS AND ALL THE REST WE HAVE TO MAKE APOLOGIES TO VISITORS HOWEVER OUR CHILDREN ARE ALL ENJOYING IT MEANTIME AND OUR FIVE MOTHERS ARE HOLDING MEETINGS AND LEARNING TO COPERATE THE OTHER BIG PROBLEM WHICH WE PROMISED TO TACKLE IS THE SERVANT PROBLEM ALL THE WORLD IS WAITING TO HEAR ABOUT THIS SO WE ARE TOLD EVEN THE ARISTOCRACY OF ENGLEWOOD IS WAITING THE LADIES COME IN AND TELL US THEIR TROUBLES AND ASK IF WE WILL FEED THEM IN CASES OF EMERGENCY THEY WERE EVEN GOING TO INVITE ME TO LECTURE THEM ABOUT ITUNTIL ONE OF THEM RECOLLECTED THAT I WAS A SOCIALIST OF A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS TYPE WE HAVE BEEN ONLY A FEW MONTHS AT IT AND WE HAVE STILL A GREAT DEAL LEFT TO ACCOMPLISH BUT WE THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT FAR ENOUGH TO CLAIM TO HAVE PROVEN OUR THESISTHAT BY MEANS OF COPERATION WITH THE SAVING WHICH IT IMPLIES THE INTRODUCTION OF SYSTEM AND OF LABOURSAVING MACHINERY HOUSEHOLD LABOUR CAN BE LIFTED TO THE RANK OF A PROFESSION AND PEOPLE FOUND TO DO IT WHO CAN BE ADMITTED TO THE COLONY AS MEMBERS THOSE WHO WISH TO MAKE FUN OF THE IDEA HAVE ASSUMED THIS TO MEAN THAT WE INSIST UPON COLLEGE DIPLOMAS FROM OUR COOKS AND CHAMBERMAIDS IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT AT ALL AS A MATTER OF FACT WE PREFER TO EMPLOY PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALWAYS EARNED THEIR LIVING BY DOING THE WORK THEY DO FOR US IT MEANS SIMPLY THAT WE LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CLEANLY AND COURTEOUS AND HONEST AND THAT THEN WHEN THEY COME INTO THE COLONY WE TREAT THEM SIMPLY AND AS A MATTER OF COURSE EXACTLY AS WE TREAT EVERYONE ELSE SO FAR AS I KNOW THERE IS NO ONE HERE WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THE LEAST DIFFICULTY OR UNPLEASANTNESS IN CONSEQUENCE THERE REMAINS TO EXPLAIN THE FINANCIAL ORGANISATION OF THE COLONY THE PROPERTY IS OWNED BY THE HOME COLONY COMPANY A SEPARATE CORPORATION WHICH WAS FORMED TO RAISE THE NECESSARY CAPITAL THE COMPANY PUTS THE BUILDING IN THOROUGH REPAIR AND EQUIPS IT FOR USE AS A RESIDENCE AND THE COLONY RENTS IT UPON A THREEYEAR LEASE ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INTEREST ON THE MORTGAGES THE INSURANCE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES AND PAYING EIGHT PER CENT DIVIDENDS UPON THE COMPANY STOCK THE OWNERSHIP OF STOCK IS THUS ENTIRELY OPTIONAL ONE MAY LIVE IN THE COLONY WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING ANY CAPITAL THE HELICON HOME COLONY IS A MEMBERSHIP CORPORATION IT IS GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS ELECTED EVERY SIX MONTHS BY SECRET BALLOT THE ONLY CONDITIONS TO RESIDENCE IN THE COLONY ARE CONGENIALITY AND FREEDOM FROM CONTAGIOUS DISEASE ONE MAY RESIDE IN THE COLONY INDEFINITELY WITHOUT BECOMING A MEMBER BUT ONLY MEMBERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE THE CONDITIONS OF MEMBERSHIP ARE ONE MONTHS RESIDENCE ELECTION BY A FOURFIFTHS VOTE AND THE PAYMENT OF AN INITIATION FEE OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COLONY PROVIDES FOR INITIATIVE REFERENDUM AND RECALL OF MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALSO FOR A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF THE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS OF THE COLONY TO BE RENDERED EVERY THREE MONTHS I HAVE QUOTED THIS AT LENGTH BECAUSE AS I SAID BEFORE I BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE SEED FROM WHICH MIGHTY FORESTS ARE DESTINED TO GROW WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN THE TIME AND STRENGTH WHICH WE HAVE GIVEN TO THIS EXPERIMENT BUT FOR OUR CERTAINTY THAT ALL THE WORLD WILL SOME DAY BE FOLLOWING IN OUR FOOTSTEPS WE ARE LIVING IN A COPERATIVE HOME BECAUSE WE WISH TO DO ITBUT SOME DAY YOU WILL BE DOING IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO YOU GET ALONG BADLY ENOUGH WITH YOUR SERVANTS YOU ADMIT STILL YOU GET ALONG SOMEHOW OR OTHER BUT HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU WHAT YOUR PLIGHT WOULD BE IF WHEN YOU WENT TO THE INTELLIGENCEOFFICE INSTEAD OF GETTING A BAD SERVANT YOU GOT NO SERVANT AT ALL WHEN THAT TIME COMES YOU WILL BE GRATEFUL TO US PIONEER HOMECOLONISTS IT IS A MOST INTERESTING THING TO WATCH IT IS THE INDUSTRIAL REPUBLIC IN THE MAKING WE CARE NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT THE INTELLECTUAL OPINIONS OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO LIVE IN THE COLONY BUT I HAVE OBSERVED THAT NEARLY EVERY NONSOCIALIST WHO HAS COME HERE HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A SOCIALIST IN THE COURSE OF A MONTH OR TWO AND THAT IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARGUE WITH HIM OR BOTHER HIM IT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE FACTS ARE FACTS WHAT BECOMES OF THE OLD SHOPWORN ARGUMENT THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO CHANGE HUMAN NATUREWHEN HUMAN NATURE IS SUDDENLY DISCOVERED TO BE SO KINDLY AND CONSIDERATE AS IT IS IN THIS BIG HOME OF OURS AND WHAT BECOMES OF THE PONDEROUS PLATITUDES ABOUT SOCIALISM VERSUS INDIVIDUALISM IN A PLACE WHERE SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE DEVELOPING THEIR INDIVIDUALITIES I AM OFTEN MOVED TO USE THIS EXPERIMENT OF OURS AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF WHAT I SAID IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER CONCERNING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MATERIAL AND INTELLECTUAL PRODUCTION HERE IN HELICON HALL WE HAVE ALL THE DREADFUL MACHINERY OF PATERNALISM WHICH FRIGHTENS OUR CAPITALIST EDITORS AND COLLEGE PRESIDENTS WHENEVER THEY CONTEMPLATE SOCIALISM WE SUBMIT OURSELVES TO THE BLIND RULE OF MAJORITIESWE ALLOW A MAJORITY TO DECIDE WHAT WE SHALL PAY FOR OUR ROOMS AND WHEN WE SHALL PAY IT TO LAY OUT OUR MENU AND REFUSE TO GIVE US PIE FOR BREAKFAST TO FORBID OUR GIVING TIPS OR WHISTLING IN THE HALLS OR DANCING AFTER A CERTAIN HOUR AT NIGHT AND WE HAVE ALL THE SYMBOLS OF OPPRESSIONCONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS AND BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGERS AND YET SOMEHOW WE ARE FREER THAN WE EVER WERE IN THE WORLD BEFORE BECAUSE BY MEANS OF THESE LITTLE CONCESSIONS WE HAVE MADE POSSIBLE A SYSTEMAND SO FLUNG FROM OUR SHOULDERS ALL AT ONCE THE BURDEN OF CARE WHICH USED TO WEAR THE LIFE OUT OF US AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR EXPERIENCE WE FIND OURSELVES REALLY FREE WITH REGARD TO THE REAL THINGS OF LIFE WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOT A CONVENTION IN THE PLACE WE DO AS WE PLEASE AND WE WEAR WHAT WE PLEASE WE ARE FREE TO COME AND GO WHERE WE PLEASE AND WHENEVER WE PLEASE WE HAVE EACH OUR OWN ROOMS OR APARTMENTS TO WHICH WE RETIRE AND IT NEVER COMES INTO ANYONES MIND TO ASK WHAT WE ARE DOING THERE WE MAY WORK ALL NIGHT AND SLEEP ALL DAY IF WE FEEL LIKE ITSO LITTLE DO WE BOTHER WITH EACH OTHERS AFFAIRS THAT I HAVE KNOWN PEOPLE TO BE AWAY FOR A DAY OR TWO WITHOUT BEING MISSED AND ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE FEEL LIKE COMPANY WE CAN HAVE IT THERE IS ALWAYS A GROUP AROUND OUR WONDERFUL FOURSIDED FIREPLACE IN THE EVENING AND YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND SOMEONE WILLING TO PLAY BILLIARDS OR GO FOR A WALK AND AS FOR OUR INTELLECTUAL FREEDOMYOU SHOULD SEE THE SPARKS SCATTER WHEN OUR HALFSCORE ASSORTED VARIETIES OF FABIANS AND IMPOSSIBILISTS INDIVIDUALISTS AND COMMUNISTANARCHISTS ALL GET TOGETHER AFTER DINNER THERE ARE SO MANY TYPEWRITERS IN HELICON HALL THAT AS YOU WANDER ABOUT THE GALLERIES IN THE MORNING YOU CAN FANCY YOU HEAR A DISTANT BATTLE WITH RAPIDFIRING GUNS AND THE PRODUCTS OF THE INDUSTRY VARY FROM DISCUSSIONS OF YOGI PHILOSOPHY AND MODERN PSYCHIC RESEARCH TO MAGAZINE FICTION WOMANS SUFFRAGE DEBATES AND JUNGLE MUCKRAKING AND YET ALL THESE PEOPLE SHARE AMICABLY IN THE OWNERSHIP OF THE FIREPLACE AND THE SWIMMINGPOOL AND THE TENNISCOURT PROVIDING THEREBY A MOST BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATION OF THE WORKING OUT OF THE FORMULA LAID DOWN BY KAUTSKY FOR THE SOCIETY OF THE FUTURE COMMUNISM IN MATERIAL PRODUCTION ANARCHISM IN INTELLECTUAL IT IS WORKING OUT SO BEAUTIFULLY THAT THE SPIRIT OF IT HAS GOT HOLD OF EVEN OUR CHILDREN AND THEY ARE HOLDING MEETINGS AND DECIDING THINGS OF OUR NINE YOUNGSTERS SEVEN ARE UNDER SIX YEARS OF AGE AND LAST NIGHT I ATTENDED A MEETING OF THE WHOLE NINE AT WHICH A GRAVE QUESTION WAS GRAVELY DISCUSSED WHEN A CHILD WAKES UP EARLY IN THE DORMITORY IS IT PROPER TO WAKE THE OTHER CHILDREN OR SHOULD THE CHILD LIE STILL AFTER A LONG DEBATE MASTER DAVID AGED FIVE REMARKED ALL IN FAVOUR PLEASE SAY AYE EVERYBODY SAID AYE THE ABOVE WAS WRITTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER ON MARCH AT FOUR OCLOCK IN THE MORNING HELICON HALL WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND AND FORTYSIX ADULTS AND FIFTEEN CHILDREN WERE TURNED OUT HOMELESS
