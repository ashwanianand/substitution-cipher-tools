WOLF LAY WITH HER BIG GRAY NOSE DROPPED ACROSS HER FOUR TUMBLING SQUEALING CUBS AND THE MOON SHONE INTO THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE WHERE THEY ALL LIVED AUGRH SAID FATHER WOLF IT IS TIME TO HUNT AGAIN HE

CHILDREN THAT THEY MAY NEVER FORGET THE HUNGRY IN THIS WORLD IT WAS THE JACKALTABAQUI THE DISHLICKERAND THE WOLVES OF INDIA DESPISE TABAQUI BECAUSE HE RUNS ABOUT MAKING MISCHIEF AND TELLING TALES AND EATING RAGS AND PIECES OF LEATHER FROM THE VILLAGE RUBBISHHEAPS BUT THEY ARE AFRAID OF HIM TOO BECAUSE TABAQUI MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE JUNGLE IS APT TO GO MAD AND THEN HE FORGETS THAT HE WAS EVER AFRAID OF ANYONE AND RUNS THROUGH THE FOREST BITING EVERYTHING IN HIS WAY EVEN THE TIGER RUNS AND HIDES WHEN LITTLE TABAQUI GOES MAD FOR MADNESS IS THE MOST DISGRACEFUL THING THAT CAN OVERTAKE A WILD CREATURE WE CALL IT HYDROPHOBIA BUT THEY CALL IT DEWANEETHE MADNESSAND RUN ENTER THEN AND LOOK SAID FATHER WOLF STIFFLY BUT THERE IS NO FOOD HERE FOR A WOLF NO SAID TABAQUI BUT FOR SO MEAN A PERSON AS MYSELF A DRY BONE IS A GOOD FEAST WHO ARE WE THE GIDURLOG THE JACKAL PEOPLE TO PICK AND CHOOSE HE SCUTTLED TO THE BACK OF THE CAVE WHERE HE FOUND THE BONE OF A BUCK WITH SOME MEAT ON IT AND SAT CRACKING THE END MERRILY ALL THANKS FOR THIS GOOD MEAL HE SAID LICKING HIS LIPS HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE NOBLE CHILDREN HOW LARGE ARE THEIR EYES AND SO YOUNG TOO INDEED INDEED I MIGHT HAVE REMEMBERED THAT THE CHILDREN OF KINGS ARE MEN FROM THE BEGINNING NOW TABAQUI KNEW AS WELL AS ANYONE ELSE THAT THERE IS NOTHING SO UNLUCKY AS TO COMPLIMENT CHILDREN TO THEIR FACES IT PLEASED HIM TO SEE MOTHER AND FATHER WOLF LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE TABAQUI SAT STILL REJOICING IN THE MISCHIEF THAT HE HAD MADE AND THEN HE SAID SPITEFULLY SHERE KHAN THE BIG ONE HAS SHIFTED HIS HUNTING GROUNDS HE WILL HUNT AMONG THESE HILLS FOR THE NEXT MOON SO HE HAS TOLD ME SHERE KHAN WAS THE TIGER WHO LIVED NEAR THE WAINGUNGA RIVER TWENTY MILES AWAY HE HAS NO RIGHT FATHER WOLF BEGAN ANGRILYBY THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE HE HAS NO RIGHT TO CHANGE HIS QUARTERS WITHOUT DUE WARNING HE WILL FRIGHTEN EVERY HEAD OF GAME WITHIN TEN MILES AND II HAVE TO KILL FOR TWO THESE DAYS HIS MOTHER DID NOT CALL HIM LUNGRI THE LAME ONE FOR NOTHING SAID MOTHER WOLF QUIETLY HE HAS BEEN LAME IN ONE FOOT FROM HIS BIRTH THAT IS WHY HE HAS ONLY KILLED CATTLE NOW THE VILLAGERS OF THE WAINGUNGA ARE ANGRY WITH HIM AND HE HAS COME HERE TO MAKE OUR VILLAGERS ANGRY THEY WILL SCOUR THE JUNGLE FOR HIM WHEN HE IS FAR AWAY AND WE AND OUR CHILDREN MUST RUN WHEN THE GRASS IS SET ALIGHT INDEED WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO SHERE KHAN SHALL I TELL HIM OF YOUR GRATITUDE SAID TABAQUI OUT SNAPPED FATHER WOLF OUT AND HUNT WITH THY MASTER THOU HAST DONE HARM ENOUGH FOR ONE NIGHT I GO SAID TABAQUI QUIETLY YE CAN HEAR SHERE KHAN BELOW IN THE THICKETS I MIGHT HAVE SAVED MYSELF THE MESSAGE FATHER WOLF LISTENED AND BELOW IN THE VALLEY THAT RAN DOWN TO A LITTLE RIVER HE HEARD THE DRY ANGRY SNARLY SINGSONG WHINE OF A TIGER WHO HAS CAUGHT NOTHING AND DOES NOT CARE IF ALL THE JUNGLE KNOWS IT THE FOOL SAID FATHER WOLF TO BEGIN A NIGHTS WORK WITH THAT NOISE DOES HE THINK THAT OUR BUCK ARE LIKE HIS FAT WAINGUNGA BULLOCKS HSH IT IS NEITHER BULLOCK NOR BUCK HE HUNTS TONIGHT SAID MOTHER WOLF IT IS MAN THE WHINE HAD CHANGED TO A SORT OF HUMMING PURR THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM EVERY QUARTER OF THE COMPASS IT WAS THE NOISE THAT BEWILDERS WOODCUTTERS AND GYPSIES SLEEPING IN THE OPEN AND MAKES THEM RUN SOMETIMES INTO THE VERY MOUTH OF THE TIGER MAN SAID FATHER WOLF SHOWING ALL HIS WHITE TEETH FAUGH ARE THERE NOT ENOUGH BEETLES AND FROGS IN THE TANKS THAT HE MUST EAT MAN AND ON OUR GROUND TOO THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE WHICH NEVER ORDERS ANYTHING WITHOUT A REASON FORBIDS EVERY BEAST TO EAT MAN EXCEPT WHEN HE IS KILLING TO SHOW HIS CHILDREN HOW TO KILL AND THEN HE MUST HUNT OUTSIDE THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF HIS PACK OR TRIBE THE REAL REASON FOR THIS IS THAT MANKILLING MEANS SOONER OR LATER THE ARRIVAL OF WHITE MEN ON ELEPHANTS WITH GUNS AND HUNDREDS OF BROWN MEN WITH GONGS AND ROCKETS AND TORCHES THEN EVERYBODY IN THE JUNGLE SUFFERS THE REASON THE BEASTS GIVE AMONG THEMSELVES IS THAT MAN IS THE WEAKEST AND MOST DEFENSELESS OF ALL LIVING THINGS AND IT IS UNSPORTSMANLIKE TO TOUCH HIM THEY SAY TOOAND IT IS TRUETHAT MANEATERS BECOME MANGY AND LOSE THEIR TEETH THE PURR GREW LOUDER AND ENDED IN THE FULLTHROATED AAARH OF THE TIGERS CHARGE THEN THERE WAS A HOWLAN UNTIGERISH HOWLFROM SHERE KHAN HE HAS MISSED SAID MOTHER WOLF WHAT IS IT FATHER WOLF RAN OUT A FEW PACES AND HEARD SHERE KHAN MUTTERING AND MUMBLING SAVAGELY AS HE TUMBLED ABOUT IN THE SCRUB THE FOOL HAS HAD NO MORE SENSE THAN TO JUMP AT A WOODCUTTERS CAMPFIRE AND HAS BURNED HIS FEET SAID FATHER WOLF WITH A GRUNT TABAQUI IS WITH HIM SOMETHING IS COMING UPHILL SAID MOTHER WOLF TWITCHING ONE EAR GET READY THE BUSHES RUSTLED A LITTLE IN THE THICKET AND FATHER WOLF DROPPED WITH HIS HAUNCHES UNDER HIM READY FOR HIS LEAP THEN IF YOU HAD BEEN WATCHING YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THE MOST WONDERFUL THING IN THE WORLDTHE WOLF CHECKED IN MIDSPRING HE MADE HIS BOUND BEFORE HE SAW WHAT IT WAS HE WAS JUMPING AT AND THEN HE TRIED TO STOP HIMSELF THE RESULT WAS THAT HE SHOT UP STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR FOR FOUR OR FIVE FEET LANDING ALMOST WHERE HE LEFT GROUND MAN HE SNAPPED A MANS CUB LOOK DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM HOLDING ON BY A LOW BRANCH STOOD A NAKED BROWN BABY WHO COULD JUST WALKAS SOFT AND AS DIMPLED A LITTLE ATOM AS EVER CAME TO A WOLFS CAVE AT NIGHT HE LOOKED UP INTO FATHER WOLFS FACE AND LAUGHED IS THAT A MANS CUB SAID MOTHER WOLF I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE BRING IT HERE A WOLF ACCUSTOMED TO MOVING HIS OWN CUBS CAN IF NECESSARY MOUTH AN EGG WITHOUT BREAKING IT AND THOUGH FATHER WOLFS JAWS CLOSED RIGHT ON THE CHILDS BACK NOT A TOOTH EVEN SCRATCHED THE SKIN AS HE LAID IT DOWN AMONG THE CUBS HOW LITTLE HOW NAKED ANDHOW BOLD SAID MOTHER WOLF SOFTLY THE BABY WAS PUSHING HIS WAY BETWEEN THE CUBS TO GET CLOSE TO THE WARM HIDE AHAI HE IS TAKING HIS MEAL WITH THE OTHERS AND SO THIS IS A MANS CUB NOW WAS THERE EVER A WOLF THAT COULD BOAST OF A MANS CUB AMONG HER CHILDREN I HAVE HEARD NOW AND AGAIN OF SUCH A THING BUT NEVER IN OUR PACK OR IN MY TIME SAID FATHER WOLF HE IS ALTOGETHER WITHOUT HAIR AND I COULD KILL HIM WITH A TOUCH OF MY FOOT BUT SEE HE LOOKS UP AND IS NOT AFRAID THE MOONLIGHT WAS BLOCKED OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE FOR SHERE KHANS GREAT SQUARE HEAD AND SHOULDERS WERE THRUST INTO THE ENTRANCE TABAQUI BEHIND HIM WAS SQUEAKING MY LORD MY LORD IT WENT IN HERE SHERE KHAN DOES US GREAT HONOR SAID FATHER WOLF BUT HIS EYES WERE VERY ANGRY WHAT DOES SHERE KHAN NEED MY QUARRY A MANS CUB WENT THIS WAY SAID SHERE KHAN ITS PARENTS HAVE RUN OFF GIVE IT TO ME SHERE KHAN HAD JUMPED AT A WOODCUTTERS CAMPFIRE AS FATHER WOLF HAD SAID AND WAS FURIOUS FROM THE PAIN OF HIS BURNED FEET BUT FATHER WOLF KNEW THAT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE WAS TOO NARROW FOR A TIGER TO COME IN BY EVEN WHERE HE WAS SHERE KHANS SHOULDERS AND FOREPAWS WERE CRAMPED FOR WANT OF ROOM AS A MANS WOULD BE IF HE TRIED TO FIGHT IN A BARREL THE WOLVES ARE A FREE PEOPLE SAID FATHER WOLF THEY TAKE ORDERS FROM THE HEAD OF THE PACK AND NOT FROM ANY STRIPED CATTLEKILLER THE MANS CUB IS OURSTO KILL IF WE CHOOSE YE CHOOSE AND YE DO NOT CHOOSE WHAT TALK IS THIS OF CHOOSING BY THE BULL THAT I KILLED AM I TO STAND NOSING INTO YOUR DOGS DEN FOR MY FAIR DUES IT IS I SHERE KHAN WHO SPEAK THE TIGERS ROAR FILLED THE CAVE WITH THUNDER MOTHER WOLF SHOOK HERSELF CLEAR OF THE CUBS AND SPRANG FORWARD HER EYES LIKE TWO GREEN MOONS IN THE DARKNESS FACING THE BLAZING EYES OF SHERE KHAN AND IT IS I RAKSHA THE DEMON WHO ANSWERS THE MANS CUB IS MINE LUNGRIMINE TO ME HE SHALL NOT BE KILLED HE SHALL LIVE TO RUN WITH THE PACK AND TO HUNT WITH THE PACK AND IN THE END LOOK YOU HUNTER OF LITTLE NAKED CUBSFROGEATERFISHKILLERHE SHALL HUNT THEE NOW GET HENCE OR BY THE SAMBHUR THAT I KILLED I EAT NO STARVED CATTLE BACK THOU GOEST TO THY MOTHER BURNED BEAST OF THE JUNGLE LAMER THAN EVER THOU CAMEST INTO THE WORLD GO FATHER WOLF LOOKED ON AMAZED HE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DAYS WHEN HE WON MOTHER WOLF IN FAIR FIGHT FROM FIVE OTHER WOLVES WHEN SHE RAN IN THE PACK AND WAS NOT CALLED THE DEMON FOR COMPLIMENTS SAKE SHERE KHAN MIGHT HAVE FACED FATHER WOLF BUT HE COULD NOT STAND UP AGAINST MOTHER WOLF FOR HE KNEW THAT WHERE HE WAS SHE HAD ALL THE ADVANTAGE OF THE GROUND AND WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH SO HE BACKED OUT OF THE CAVE MOUTH GROWLING AND WHEN HE WAS CLEAR HE SHOUTED EACH DOG BARKS IN HIS OWN YARD WE WILL SEE WHAT THE PACK WILL SAY TO THIS FOSTERING OF MANCUBS THE CUB IS MINE AND TO MY TEETH HE WILL COME IN THE END O BUSHTAILED THIEVES MOTHER WOLF THREW HERSELF DOWN PANTING AMONG THE CUBS AND FATHER WOLF SAID TO HER GRAVELY SHERE KHAN SPEAKS THIS MUCH TRUTH THE CUB MUST BE SHOWN TO THE PACK WILT THOU STILL KEEP HIM MOTHER KEEP HIM SHE GASPED HE CAME NAKED BY NIGHT ALONE AND VERY HUNGRY YET HE WAS NOT AFRAID LOOK HE HAS PUSHED ONE OF MY BABES TO ONE SIDE ALREADY AND THAT LAME BUTCHER WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM AND WOULD HAVE RUN OFF TO THE WAINGUNGA WHILE THE VILLAGERS HERE HUNTED THROUGH ALL OUR LAIRS IN REVENGE KEEP HIM ASSUREDLY I WILL KEEP HIM LIE STILL LITTLE FROG O THOU MOWGLIFOR MOWGLI THE FROG I WILL CALL THEETHE TIME WILL COME WHEN THOU WILT HUNT SHERE KHAN AS HE HAS HUNTED THEE BUT WHAT WILL OUR PACK SAY SAID FATHER WOLF THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE LAYS DOWN VERY CLEARLY THAT ANY WOLF MAY WHEN HE MARRIES WITHDRAW FROM THE PACK HE BELONGS TO BUT AS SOON AS HIS CUBS ARE OLD ENOUGH TO STAND ON THEIR FEET HE MUST BRING THEM TO THE PACK COUNCIL WHICH IS GENERALLY HELD ONCE A MONTH AT FULL MOON IN ORDER THAT THE OTHER WOLVES MAY IDENTIFY THEM AFTER THAT INSPECTION THE CUBS ARE FREE TO RUN WHERE THEY PLEASE AND UNTIL THEY HAVE KILLED THEIR FIRST BUCK NO EXCUSE IS ACCEPTED IF A GROWN WOLF OF THE PACK KILLS ONE OF THEM THE PUNISHMENT IS DEATH WHERE THE MURDERER CAN BE FOUND AND IF YOU THINK FOR A MINUTE YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS MUST BE SO FATHER WOLF WAITED TILL HIS CUBS COULD RUN A LITTLE AND THEN ON THE NIGHT OF THE PACK MEETING TOOK THEM AND MOWGLI AND MOTHER WOLF TO THE COUNCIL ROCKA HILLTOP COVERED WITH STONES AND BOULDERS WHERE A HUNDRED WOLVES COULD HIDE AKELA THE GREAT GRAY LONE WOLF WHO LED ALL THE PACK BY STRENGTH AND CUNNING LAY OUT AT FULL LENGTH ON HIS ROCK AND BELOW HIM SAT FORTY OR MORE WOLVES OF EVERY SIZE AND COLOR FROM BADGERCOLORED VETERANS WHO COULD HANDLE A BUCK ALONE TO YOUNG BLACK THREEYEAROLDS WHO THOUGHT THEY COULD THE LONE WOLF HAD LED THEM FOR A YEAR NOW HE HAD FALLEN TWICE INTO A WOLF TRAP IN HIS YOUTH AND ONCE HE HAD BEEN BEATEN AND LEFT FOR DEAD SO HE KNEW THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF MEN THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING AT THE ROCK THE CUBS TUMBLED OVER EACH OTHER IN THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE WHERE THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS SAT AND NOW AND AGAIN A SENIOR WOLF WOULD GO QUIETLY UP TO A CUB LOOK AT HIM CAREFULLY AND RETURN TO HIS PLACE ON NOISELESS FEET SOMETIMES A MOTHER WOULD PUSH HER CUB FAR OUT INTO THE MOONLIGHT TO BE SURE THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN OVERLOOKED AKELA FROM HIS ROCK WOULD CRY YE KNOW THE LAWYE KNOW THE LAW LOOK WELL O WOLVES AND THE ANXIOUS MOTHERS WOULD TAKE UP THE CALL LOOKLOOK WELL O WOLVES AT LASTAND MOTHER WOLFS NECK BRISTLES LIFTED AS THE TIME CAMEFATHER WOLF PUSHED MOWGLI THE FROG AS THEY CALLED HIM INTO THE CENTER WHERE HE SAT LAUGHING AND PLAYING WITH SOME PEBBLES THAT GLISTENED IN THE MOONLIGHT AKELA NEVER RAISED HIS HEAD FROM HIS PAWS BUT WENT ON WITH THE MONOTONOUS CRY LOOK WELL A MUFFLED ROAR CAME UP FROM BEHIND THE ROCKSTHE VOICE OF SHERE KHAN CRYING THE CUB IS MINE GIVE HIM TO ME WHAT HAVE THE FREE PEOPLE TO DO WITH A MANS CUB AKELA NEVER EVEN TWITCHED HIS EARS ALL HE SAID WAS LOOK WELL O WOLVES WHAT HAVE THE FREE PEOPLE TO DO WITH THE ORDERS OF ANY SAVE THE FREE PEOPLE LOOK WELL THERE WAS A CHORUS OF DEEP GROWLS AND A YOUNG WOLF IN HIS FOURTH YEAR FLUNG BACK SHERE KHANS QUESTION TO AKELA WHAT HAVE THE FREE PEOPLE TO DO WITH A MANS CUB NOW THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE LAYS DOWN THAT IF THERE IS ANY DISPUTE AS TO THE RIGHT OF A CUB TO BE ACCEPTED BY THE PACK HE MUST BE SPOKEN FOR BY AT LEAST TWO MEMBERS OF THE PACK WHO ARE NOT HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WHO SPEAKS FOR THIS CUB SAID AKELA AMONG THE FREE PEOPLE WHO SPEAKS THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND MOTHER WOLF GOT READY FOR WHAT SHE KNEW WOULD BE HER LAST FIGHT IF THINGS CAME TO FIGHTING THEN THE ONLY OTHER CREATURE WHO IS ALLOWED AT THE PACK COUNCILBALOO THE SLEEPY BROWN BEAR WHO TEACHES THE WOLF CUBS THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE OLD BALOO WHO CAN COME AND GO WHERE HE PLEASES BECAUSE HE EATS ONLY NUTS AND ROOTS AND HONEYROSE UPON HIS HIND QUARTERS AND GRUNTED THE MANS CUBTHE MANS CUB HE SAID I SPEAK FOR THE MANS CUB THERE IS NO HARM IN A MANS CUB I HAVE NO GIFT OF WORDS BUT I SPEAK THE TRUTH LET HIM RUN WITH THE PACK AND BE ENTERED WITH THE OTHERS I MYSELF WILL TEACH HIM WE NEED YET ANOTHER SAID AKELA BALOO HAS SPOKEN AND HE IS OUR TEACHER FOR THE YOUNG CUBS WHO SPEAKS BESIDES BALOO A BLACK SHADOW DROPPED DOWN INTO THE CIRCLE IT WAS BAGHEERA THE BLACK PANTHER INKY BLACK ALL OVER BUT WITH THE PANTHER MARKINGS SHOWING UP IN CERTAIN LIGHTS LIKE THE PATTERN OF WATERED SILK EVERYBODY KNEW BAGHEERA AND NOBODY CARED TO CROSS HIS PATH FOR HE WAS AS CUNNING AS TABAQUI AS BOLD AS THE WILD BUFFALO AND AS RECKLESS AS THE WOUNDED ELEPHANT BUT HE HAD A VOICE AS SOFT AS WILD HONEY DRIPPING FROM A TREE AND A SKIN SOFTER THAN DOWN O AKELA AND YE THE FREE PEOPLE HE PURRED I HAVE NO RIGHT IN YOUR ASSEMBLY BUT THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE SAYS THAT IF THERE IS A DOUBT WHICH IS NOT A KILLING MATTER IN REGARD TO A NEW CUB THE LIFE OF THAT CUB MAY BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE AND THE LAW DOES NOT SAY WHO MAY OR MAY NOT PAY THAT PRICE AM I RIGHT GOOD GOOD SAID THE YOUNG WOLVES WHO ARE ALWAYS HUNGRY LISTEN TO BAGHEERA THE CUB CAN BE BOUGHT FOR A PRICE IT IS THE LAW KNOWING THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO SPEAK HERE I ASK YOUR LEAVE SPEAK THEN CRIED TWENTY VOICES TO KILL A NAKED CUB IS SHAME BESIDES HE MAY MAKE BETTER SPORT FOR YOU WHEN HE IS GROWN BALOO HAS SPOKEN IN HIS BEHALF NOW TO BALOOS WORD I WILL ADD ONE BULL AND A FAT ONE NEWLY KILLED NOT HALF A MILE FROM HERE IF YE WILL ACCEPT THE MANS CUB ACCORDING TO THE LAW IS IT DIFFICULT THERE WAS A CLAMOR OF SCORES OF VOICES SAYING WHAT MATTER HE WILL DIE IN THE WINTER RAINS HE WILL SCORCH IN THE SUN WHAT HARM CAN A NAKED FROG DO US LET HIM RUN WITH THE PACK WHERE IS THE BULL BAGHEERA LET HIM BE ACCEPTED AND THEN CAME AKELAS DEEP BAY CRYING LOOK WELLLOOK WELL O WOLVES MOWGLI WAS STILL DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE PEBBLES AND HE DID NOT NOTICE WHEN THE WOLVES CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM ONE BY ONE AT LAST THEY ALL WENT DOWN THE HILL FOR THE DEAD BULL AND ONLY AKELA BAGHEERA BALOO AND MOWGLIS OWN WOLVES WERE LEFT SHERE KHAN ROARED STILL IN THE NIGHT FOR HE WAS VERY ANGRY THAT MOWGLI HAD NOT BEEN HANDED OVER TO HIM AY ROAR WELL SAID BAGHEERA UNDER HIS WHISKERS FOR THE TIME WILL COME WHEN THIS NAKED THING WILL MAKE THEE ROAR TO ANOTHER TUNE OR I KNOW NOTHING OF MAN IT WAS WELL DONE SAID AKELA MEN AND THEIR CUBS ARE VERY WISE HE MAY BE A HELP IN TIME TRULY A HELP IN TIME OF NEED FOR NONE CAN HOPE TO LEAD THE PACK FOREVER SAID BAGHEERA AKELA SAID NOTHING HE WAS THINKING OF THE TIME THAT COMES TO EVERY LEADER OF EVERY PACK WHEN HIS STRENGTH GOES FROM HIM AND HE GETS FEEBLER AND FEEBLER TILL AT LAST HE IS KILLED BY THE WOLVES AND A NEW LEADER COMES UPTO BE KILLED IN HIS TURN TAKE HIM AWAY HE SAID TO FATHER WOLF AND TRAIN HIM AS BEFITS ONE OF THE FREE PEOPLE AND THAT IS HOW MOWGLI WAS ENTERED INTO THE SEEONEE WOLF PACK FOR THE PRICE OF A BULL AND ON BALOOS GOOD WORD NOW YOU MUST BE CONTENT TO SKIP TEN OR ELEVEN WHOLE YEARS AND ONLY GUESS AT ALL THE WONDERFUL LIFE THAT MOWGLI LED AMONG THE WOLVES BECAUSE IF IT WERE WRITTEN OUT IT WOULD FILL EVER SO MANY BOOKS HE GREW UP WITH THE CUBS THOUGH THEY OF COURSE WERE GROWN WOLVES ALMOST BEFORE HE WAS A CHILD AND FATHER WOLF TAUGHT HIM HIS BUSINESS AND THE MEANING OF THINGS IN THE JUNGLE TILL EVERY RUSTLE IN THE GRASS EVERY BREATH OF THE WARM NIGHT AIR EVERY NOTE OF THE OWLS ABOVE HIS HEAD EVERY SCRATCH OF A BATS CLAWS AS IT ROOSTED FOR A WHILE IN A TREE AND EVERY SPLASH OF EVERY LITTLE FISH JUMPING IN A POOL MEANT JUST AS MUCH TO HIM AS THE WORK OF HIS OFFICE MEANS TO A BUSINESS MAN WHEN HE WAS NOT LEARNING HE SAT OUT IN THE SUN AND SLEPT AND ATE AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN WHEN HE FELT DIRTY OR HOT HE SWAM IN THE FOREST POOLS AND WHEN HE WANTED HONEY BALOO TOLD HIM THAT HONEY AND NUTS WERE JUST AS PLEASANT TO EAT AS RAW MEAT HE CLIMBED UP FOR IT AND THAT BAGHEERA SHOWED HIM HOW TO DO BAGHEERA WOULD LIE OUT ON A BRANCH AND CALL COME ALONG LITTLE BROTHER AND AT FIRST MOWGLI WOULD CLING LIKE THE SLOTH BUT AFTERWARD HE WOULD FLING HIMSELF THROUGH THE BRANCHES ALMOST AS BOLDLY AS THE GRAY APE HE TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE COUNCIL ROCK TOO WHEN THE PACK MET AND THERE HE DISCOVERED THAT IF HE STARED HARD AT ANY WOLF THE WOLF WOULD BE FORCED TO DROP HIS EYES AND SO HE USED TO STARE FOR FUN AT OTHER TIMES HE WOULD PICK THE LONG THORNS OUT OF THE PADS OF HIS FRIENDS FOR WOLVES SUFFER TERRIBLY FROM THORNS AND BURS IN THEIR COATS HE WOULD GO DOWN THE HILLSIDE INTO THE CULTIVATED LANDS BY NIGHT AND LOOK VERY CURIOUSLY AT THE VILLAGERS IN THEIR HUTS BUT HE HAD A MISTRUST OF MEN BECAUSE BAGHEERA SHOWED HIM A SQUARE BOX WITH A DROP GATE SO CUNNINGLY HIDDEN IN THE JUNGLE THAT HE NEARLY WALKED INTO IT AND TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS A TRAP HE LOVED BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO GO WITH BAGHEERA INTO THE DARK WARM HEART OF THE FOREST TO SLEEP ALL THROUGH THE DROWSY DAY AND AT NIGHT SEE HOW BAGHEERA DID HIS KILLING BAGHEERA KILLED RIGHT AND LEFT AS HE FELT HUNGRY AND SO DID MOWGLIWITH ONE EXCEPTION AS SOON AS HE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THINGS BAGHEERA TOLD HIM THAT HE MUST NEVER TOUCH CATTLE BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN BOUGHT INTO THE PACK AT THE PRICE OF A BULLS LIFE ALL THE JUNGLE IS THINE SAID BAGHEERA AND THOU CANST KILL EVERYTHING THAT THOU ART STRONG ENOUGH TO KILL BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE BULL THAT BOUGHT THEE THOU MUST NEVER KILL OR EAT ANY CATTLE YOUNG OR OLD THAT IS THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE MOWGLI OBEYED FAITHFULLY AND HE GREW AND GREW STRONG AS A BOY MUST GROW WHO DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE IS LEARNING ANY LESSONS AND WHO HAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD TO THINK OF EXCEPT THINGS TO EAT MOTHER WOLF TOLD HIM ONCE OR TWICE THAT SHERE KHAN WAS NOT A CREATURE TO BE TRUSTED AND THAT SOME DAY HE MUST KILL SHERE KHAN BUT THOUGH A YOUNG WOLF WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED THAT ADVICE EVERY HOUR MOWGLI FORGOT IT BECAUSE HE WAS ONLY A BOYTHOUGH HE WOULD HAVE CALLED HIMSELF A WOLF IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK IN ANY HUMAN TONGUE SHERE KHAN WAS ALWAYS CROSSING HIS PATH IN THE JUNGLE FOR AS AKELA GREW OLDER AND FEEBLER THE LAME TIGER HAD COME TO BE GREAT FRIENDS WITH THE YOUNGER WOLVES OF THE PACK WHO FOLLOWED HIM FOR SCRAPS A THING AKELA WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED IF HE HAD DARED TO PUSH HIS AUTHORITY TO THE PROPER BOUNDS THEN SHERE KHAN WOULD FLATTER THEM AND WONDER THAT SUCH FINE YOUNG HUNTERS WERE CONTENT TO BE LED BY A DYING WOLF AND A MANS CUB THEY TELL ME SHERE KHAN WOULD SAY THAT AT COUNCIL YE DARE NOT LOOK HIM BETWEEN THE EYES AND THE YOUNG WOLVES WOULD GROWL AND BRISTLE BAGHEERA WHO HAD EYES AND EARS EVERYWHERE KNEW SOMETHING OF THIS AND ONCE OR TWICE HE TOLD MOWGLI IN SO MANY WORDS THAT SHERE KHAN WOULD KILL HIM SOME DAY MOWGLI WOULD LAUGH AND ANSWER I HAVE THE PACK AND I HAVE THEE AND BALOO THOUGH HE IS SO LAZY MIGHT STRIKE A BLOW OR TWO FOR MY SAKE WHY SHOULD I BE AFRAID IT WAS ONE VERY WARM DAY THAT A NEW NOTION CAME TO BAGHEERABORN OF SOMETHING THAT HE HAD HEARD PERHAPS IKKI THE PORCUPINE HAD TOLD HIM BUT HE SAID TO MOWGLI WHEN THEY WERE DEEP IN THE JUNGLE AS THE BOY LAY WITH HIS HEAD ON BAGHEERAS BEAUTIFUL BLACK SKIN LITTLE BROTHER HOW OFTEN HAVE I TOLD THEE THAT SHERE KHAN IS THY ENEMY AS MANY TIMES AS THERE ARE NUTS ON THAT PALM SAID MOWGLI WHO NATURALLY COULD NOT COUNT WHAT OF IT I AM SLEEPY BAGHEERA AND SHERE KHAN IS ALL LONG TAIL AND LOUD TALKLIKE MAO THE PEACOCK BUT THIS IS NO TIME FOR SLEEPING BALOO KNOWS IT I KNOW IT THE PACK KNOW IT AND EVEN THE FOOLISH FOOLISH DEER KNOW TABAQUI HAS TOLD THEE TOO HO HO SAID MOWGLI TABAQUI CAME TO ME NOT LONG AGO WITH SOME RUDE TALK THAT I WAS A NAKED MANS CUB AND NOT FIT TO DIG PIGNUTS BUT I CAUGHT TABAQUI BY THE TAIL AND SWUNG HIM TWICE AGAINST A PALMTREE TO TEACH HIM BETTER MANNERS THAT WAS FOOLISHNESS FOR THOUGH TABAQUI IS A MISCHIEFMAKER HE WOULD HAVE TOLD THEE OF SOMETHING THAT CONCERNED THEE CLOSELY OPEN THOSE EYES LITTLE BROTHER SHERE KHAN DARE NOT KILL THEE IN THE JUNGLE BUT REMEMBER AKELA IS VERY OLD AND SOON THE DAY COMES WHEN HE CANNOT KILL HIS BUCK AND THEN HE WILL BE LEADER NO MORE MANY OF THE WOLVES THAT LOOKED THEE OVER WHEN THOU WAST BROUGHT TO THE COUNCIL FIRST ARE OLD TOO AND THE YOUNG WOLVES BELIEVE AS SHERE KHAN HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT A MANCUB HAS NO PLACE WITH THE PACK IN A LITTLE TIME THOU WILT BE A MAN AND WHAT IS A MAN THAT HE SHOULD NOT RUN WITH HIS BROTHERS SAID MOWGLI I WAS BORN IN THE JUNGLE I HAVE OBEYED THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE AND THERE IS NO WOLF OF OURS FROM WHOSE PAWS I HAVE NOT PULLED A THORN SURELY THEY ARE MY BROTHERS BAGHEERA STRETCHED HIMSELF AT FULL LENGTH AND HALF SHUT HIS EYES LITTLE BROTHER SAID HE FEEL UNDER MY JAW MOWGLI PUT UP HIS STRONG BROWN HAND AND JUST UNDER BAGHEERAS SILKY CHIN WHERE THE GIANT ROLLING MUSCLES WERE ALL HID BY THE GLOSSY HAIR HE CAME UPON A LITTLE BALD SPOT THERE IS NO ONE IN THE JUNGLE THAT KNOWS THAT I BAGHEERA CARRY THAT MARKTHE MARK OF THE COLLAR AND YET LITTLE BROTHER I WAS BORN AMONG MEN AND IT WAS AMONG MEN THAT MY MOTHER DIEDIN THE CAGES OF THE KINGS PALACE AT OODEYPORE IT WAS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT I PAID THE PRICE FOR THEE AT THE COUNCIL WHEN THOU WAST A LITTLE

NOT KILLED IN THE COUNCIL BUT WHYBUT WHY SHOULD ANY WISH TO KILL ME SAID MOWGLI LOOK AT ME SAID BAGHEERA AND MOWGLI LOOKED AT HIM STEADILY BETWEEN THE EYES THE BIG PANTHER TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY IN HALF A MINUTE THAT IS WHY HE SAID SHIFTING HIS PAW ON THE LEAVES NOT EVEN I CAN LOOK THEE BETWEEN THE EYES AND I WAS BORN AMONG MEN AND I LOVE THEE LITTLE BROTHER THE OTHERS THEY HATE THEE BECAUSE THEIR EYES CANNOT MEET THINE BECAUSE THOU ART WISE BECAUSE THOU HAST PULLED OUT THORNS FROM THEIR FEETBECAUSE THOU ART A MAN I DID NOT KNOW THESE THINGS SAID MOWGLI SULLENLY AND HE FROWNED UNDER HIS HEAVY BLACK EYEBROWS WHAT IS THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE STRIKE FIRST AND THEN GIVE TONGUE BY THY VERY CARELESSNESS THEY KNOW THAT THOU ART A MAN BUT BE WISE IT IS IN MY HEART THAT WHEN AKELA MISSES HIS NEXT

FAR AND FAR THROUGH THE FOREST RUNNING HARD AND HIS HEART WAS HOT IN HIM HE CAME TO THE CAVE AS THE EVENING MIST ROSE AND DREW BREATH AND LOOKED DOWN THE VALLEY THE CUBS WERE OUT BUT MOTHER WOLF AT THE BACK OF THE CAVE KNEW BY HIS BREATHING THAT SOMETHING WAS TROUBLING HER FROG WHAT IS IT SON SHE SAID SOME BATS CHATTER OF SHERE KHAN HE CALLED BACK I HUNT AMONG THE PLOWED FIELDS TONIGHT AND HE PLUNGED DOWNWARD THROUGH THE BUSHES TO THE STREAM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY THERE HE CHECKED FOR HE HEARD THE YELL OF THE PACK HUNTING HEARD THE BELLOW OF A HUNTED SAMBHUR AND THE SNORT AS THE BUCK TURNED AT BAY THEN THERE WERE WICKED BITTER HOWLS FROM THE YOUNG WOLVES AKELA AKELA LET THE LONE WOLF SHOW HIS STRENGTH ROOM FOR THE LEADER OF THE PACK SPRING AKELA THE LONE WOLF MUST HAVE SPRUNG AND MISSED HIS HOLD FOR MOWGLI HEARD THE SNAP OF HIS TEETH AND THEN A YELP AS THE SAMBHUR KNOCKED HIM OVER WITH HIS FOREFOOT HE DID NOT WAIT FOR ANYTHING MORE BUT DASHED ON AND THE YELLS GREW FAINTER BEHIND HIM AS HE RAN INTO THE CROPLANDS WHERE THE VILLAGERS LIVED BAGHEERA SPOKE TRUTH HE PANTED AS HE NESTLED DOWN IN SOME CATTLE FODDER BY THE WINDOW OF A HUT TOMORROW IS ONE DAY BOTH FOR AKELA AND FOR ME THEN HE PRESSED HIS FACE CLOSE TO THE WINDOW AND WATCHED THE FIRE ON THE HEARTH HE SAW THE HUSBANDMANS WIFE GET UP AND FEED IT IN THE NIGHT WITH BLACK LUMPS AND WHEN THE MORNING CAME AND THE MISTS WERE ALL WHITE AND COLD HE SAW THE MANS CHILD PICK UP A WICKER POT PLASTERED INSIDE WITH EARTH FILL IT WITH LUMPS OF REDHOT CHARCOAL PUT IT UNDER HIS BLANKET AND GO OUT TO TEND THE COWS IN THE BYRE IS THAT ALL SAID MOWGLI IF A CUB CAN DO IT THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR SO HE STRODE ROUND THE CORNER AND MET THE BOY TOOK THE POT FROM HIS HAND AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE MIST WHILE THE BOY HOWLED

THOSE MYSTERIOUS THINGS THAT ARE CALLED MEN HUNTINGSONG OF THE SEEONEE PACK AS THE DAWN WAS BREAKING THE SAMBHUR BELLED ONCE TWICE AND AGAIN AND A DOE LEAPED UP AND A DOE LEAPED UP FROM THE POND IN THE WOOD WHERE THE WILD DEER SUP THIS I SCOUTING ALONE BEHELD ONCE TWICE AND AGAIN AS THE DAWN WAS BREAKING THE SAMBHUR BELLED ONCE TWICE AND AGAIN AND A WOLF STOLE BACK AND A WOLF STOLE BACK TO CARRY THE WORD TO THE WAITING PACK AND WE SOUGHT AND WE FOUND AND WE BAYED ON HIS TRACK ONCE TWICE AND AGAIN AS THE DAWN WAS BREAKING THE WOLF PACK YELLED ONCE TWICE AND AGAIN FEET IN THE JUNGLE THAT LEAVE NO MARK EYES THAT CAN SEE IN THE DARKTHE DARK TONGUEGIVE TONGUE TO IT HARK O HARK ONCE TWICE AND AGAIN KAAS HUNTING HIS SPOTS ARE THE JOY OF THE LEOPARD HIS HORNS ARE THE BUFFALOS PRIDE BE CLEAN FOR THE STRENGTH OF THE HUNTER IS KNOWN BY THE GLOSS OF HIS HIDE IF YE FIND THAT THE BULLOCK CAN TOSS YOU OR THE HEAVYBROWED SAMBHUR CAN GORE YE NEED NOT STOP WORK TO INFORM US WE KNEW IT TEN SEASONS BEFORE OPPRESS NOT THE CUBS OF THE STRANGER BUT HAIL THEM AS SISTER AND BROTHER FOR THOUGH THEY ARE LITTLE AND FUBSY IT MAY BE THE BEAR IS THEIR MOTHER THERE IS NONE LIKE TO ME SAYS THE CUB IN THE PRIDE OF HIS EARLIEST KILL BUT THE JUNGLE IS LARGE AND THE CUB HE IS SMALL LET HIM THINK AND BE STILL MAXIMS OF BALOO ALL THAT IS TOLD HERE HAPPENED SOME TIME BEFORE MOWGLI WAS TURNED OUT OF THE SEEONEE WOLF PACK OR REVENGED HIMSELF ON SHERE KHAN THE TIGER IT WAS IN THE DAYS WHEN BALOO WAS TEACHING HIM THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE THE BIG SERIOUS OLD BROWN BEAR WAS DELIGHTED TO HAVE SO QUICK A PUPIL FOR THE YOUNG WOLVES WILL ONLY LEARN AS MUCH OF THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE AS APPLIES TO THEIR OWN PACK AND TRIBE AND RUN AWAY AS SOON AS THEY CAN REPEAT THE HUNTING VERSEFEET THAT MAKE NO NOISE EYES THAT CAN SEE IN THE DARK EARS THAT CAN HEAR THE WINDS IN THEIR LAIRS AND SHARP WHITE TEETH ALL THESE THINGS ARE THE MARKS OF OUR BROTHERS EXCEPT TABAQUI THE JACKAL AND THE HYAENA WHOM WE HATE BUT MOWGLI AS A MANCUB HAD TO LEARN A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THIS SOMETIMES BAGHEERA THE BLACK PANTHER WOULD COME LOUNGING THROUGH THE JUNGLE TO SEE HOW HIS PET WAS GETTING ON AND WOULD PURR WITH HIS HEAD AGAINST A TREE WHILE MOWGLI RECITED THE DAYS LESSON TO BALOO THE BOY COULD CLIMB ALMOST AS WELL AS HE COULD SWIM AND SWIM ALMOST AS WELL AS HE COULD RUN SO BALOO THE TEACHER OF THE LAW TAUGHT HIM THE WOOD AND WATER LAWS HOW TO TELL A ROTTEN BRANCH FROM A SOUND ONE HOW TO SPEAK POLITELY TO THE WILD BEES WHEN HE CAME UPON A HIVE OF THEM FIFTY FEET ABOVE GROUND WHAT TO SAY TO MANG THE BAT WHEN HE DISTURBED HIM IN THE BRANCHES AT MIDDAY AND HOW TO WARN THE WATERSNAKES IN THE POOLS BEFORE HE SPLASHED DOWN AMONG THEM NONE OF THE JUNGLE PEOPLE LIKE BEING DISTURBED AND ALL ARE VERY READY TO FLY AT AN INTRUDER THEN TOO MOWGLI WAS TAUGHT THE STRANGERS HUNTING CALL WHICH MUST BE REPEATED ALOUD TILL IT IS ANSWERED WHENEVER ONE OF THE JUNGLEPEOPLE HUNTS OUTSIDE HIS OWN GROUNDS IT MEANS TRANSLATED GIVE ME LEAVE TO HUNT HERE BECAUSE I AM HUNGRY AND THE ANSWER IS HUNT THEN FOR FOOD BUT NOT FOR PLEASURE ALL THIS WILL SHOW YOU HOW MUCH MOWGLI HAD TO LEARN BY HEART AND HE GREW VERY TIRED OF SAYING THE SAME THING OVER A HUNDRED TIMES BUT AS BALOO SAID TO BAGHEERA ONE DAY WHEN MOWGLI HAD BEEN CUFFED AND RUN OFF IN A TEMPER A MANS CUB IS A MANS CUB AND HE MUST LEARN ALL THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE BUT THINK HOW SMALL HE IS SAID THE BLACK PANTHER WHO WOULD HAVE SPOILED MOWGLI IF HE HAD HAD HIS OWN WAY HOW CAN HIS LITTLE HEAD CARRY ALL THY LONG TALK IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE JUNGLE TOO LITTLE TO BE KILLED NO THAT IS WHY I TEACH HIM THESE THINGS AND THAT IS WHY I HIT HIM VERY SOFTLY WHEN HE FORGETS SOFTLY WHAT DOST THOU KNOW OF SOFTNESS OLD IRONFEET BAGHEERA GRUNTED HIS FACE IS ALL BRUISED TODAY BY THYSOFTNESS UGH BETTER HE SHOULD BE BRUISED FROM HEAD TO FOOT BY ME WHO LOVE HIM THAN THAT HE SHOULD COME TO HARM THROUGH IGNORANCE BALOO ANSWERED VERY EARNESTLY I AM NOW TEACHING HIM THE MASTER WORDS OF THE JUNGLE THAT SHALL PROTECT HIM WITH THE BIRDS AND THE SNAKE PEOPLE AND ALL THAT HUNT ON FOUR FEET EXCEPT HIS OWN PACK HE CAN NOW CLAIM PROTECTION IF HE WILL ONLY REMEMBER THE WORDS FROM ALL IN THE JUNGLE IS NOT THAT WORTH A LITTLE BEATING WELL LOOK TO IT THEN THAT THOU DOST NOT KILL THE MANCUB HE IS NO TREE TRUNK TO SHARPEN THY BLUNT CLAWS UPON BUT WHAT ARE THOSE MASTER WORDS I AM MORE LIKELY TO GIVE HELP THAN TO ASK ITBAGHEERA STRETCHED OUT ONE PAW AND ADMIRED THE STEELBLUE RIPPINGCHISEL TALONS AT THE END OF ITSTILL I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW I WILL CALL MOWGLI AND HE SHALL SAY THEMIF HE WILL COME LITTLE BROTHER MY HEAD IS RINGING LIKE A BEE TREE SAID A SULLEN LITTLE VOICE OVER THEIR HEADS AND MOWGLI SLID DOWN A TREE TRUNK VERY ANGRY AND INDIGNANT ADDING AS HE REACHED THE GROUND I COME FOR BAGHEERA AND NOT FOR THEE FAT OLD BALOO THAT IS ALL ONE TO ME SAID BALOO THOUGH HE WAS HURT AND GRIEVED TELL BAGHEERA THEN THE MASTER WORDS OF THE JUNGLE THAT I HAVE TAUGHT THEE THIS DAY MASTER WORDS FOR WHICH PEOPLE SAID MOWGLI DELIGHTED TO SHOW OFF THE JUNGLE HAS MANY TONGUES I KNOW THEM ALL A LITTLE THOU KNOWEST BUT NOT MUCH SEE O BAGHEERA THEY NEVER THANK THEIR TEACHER NOT ONE SMALL WOLFLING HAS EVER COME BACK TO THANK OLD BALOO FOR HIS TEACHINGS SAY THE WORD FOR THE HUNTINGPEOPLE THENGREAT SCHOLAR WE BE OF ONE BLOOD YE AND I SAID MOWGLI GIVING THE WORDS THE BEAR ACCENT WHICH ALL THE HUNTING PEOPLE USE GOOD NOW FOR THE BIRDS MOWGLI REPEATED WITH THE KITES WHISTLE AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE NOW FOR THE SNAKEPEOPLE SAID BAGHEERA THE ANSWER WAS A PERFECTLY INDESCRIBABLE HISS AND MOWGLI KICKED UP HIS FEET BEHIND CLAPPED HIS HANDS TOGETHER TO APPLAUD HIMSELF AND JUMPED ON TO BAGHEERAS BACK WHERE HE SAT SIDEWAYS DRUMMING WITH HIS HEELS ON THE GLOSSY SKIN AND MAKING THE WORST FACES HE COULD THINK OF AT BALOO THERETHERE THAT WAS WORTH A LITTLE BRUISE SAID THE BROWN BEAR TENDERLY SOME DAY THOU WILT REMEMBER ME THEN HE TURNED ASIDE TO TELL BAGHEERA HOW HE HAD BEGGED THE MASTER WORDS FROM HATHI THE WILD ELEPHANT WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT THESE THINGS AND HOW HATHI HAD TAKEN MOWGLI DOWN TO A POOL TO GET THE SNAKE WORD FROM A WATERSNAKE BECAUSE BALOO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE IT AND HOW MOWGLI WAS NOW REASONABLY SAFE AGAINST ALL ACCIDENTS IN THE JUNGLE BECAUSE NEITHER SNAKE BIRD NOR BEAST WOULD HURT HIM NO ONE THEN IS TO BE FEARED BALOO WOUND UP PATTING HIS BIG FURRY STOMACH WITH PRIDE EXCEPT HIS OWN TRIBE SAID BAGHEERA UNDER HIS BREATH AND THEN ALOUD TO MOWGLI HAVE A CARE FOR MY RIBS LITTLE BROTHER WHAT IS ALL THIS DANCING UP AND DOWN MOWGLI HAD BEEN TRYING TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD BY PULLING AT BAGHEERAS SHOULDER FUR AND KICKING HARD WHEN THE TWO LISTENED TO HIM HE WAS SHOUTING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE AND SO I SHALL HAVE A TRIBE OF MY OWN AND LEAD THEM THROUGH THE BRANCHES ALL DAY LONG WHAT IS THIS NEW FOLLY LITTLE DREAMER OF DREAMS SAID BAGHEERA YES AND THROW BRANCHES AND DIRT AT OLD BALOO MOWGLI WENT ON THEY HAVE PROMISED ME THIS AH WHOOF BALOOS BIG PAW SCOOPED MOWGLI OFF BAGHEERAS BACK AND AS THE BOY LAY BETWEEN THE BIG FOREPAWS HE COULD SEE THE BEAR WAS ANGRY MOWGLI SAID BALOO THOU HAST BEEN TALKING WITH THE BANDARLOGTHE MONKEY PEOPLE MOWGLI LOOKED AT BAGHEERA TO SEE IF THE PANTHER WAS ANGRY TOO AND BAGHEERAS EYES WERE AS HARD AS JADE STONES THOU HAST BEEN WITH THE MONKEY PEOPLETHE GRAY APESTHE PEOPLE WITHOUT A LAWTHE EATERS OF EVERYTHING THAT IS GREAT SHAME WHEN BALOO HURT MY HEAD SAID MOWGLI HE WAS STILL ON HIS BACK I WENT AWAY AND THE GRAY APES CAME DOWN FROM THE TREES AND HAD PITY ON ME NO ONE ELSE CARED HE SNUFFLED A LITTLE THE PITY OF THE MONKEY PEOPLE BALOO SNORTED THE STILLNESS OF THE MOUNTAIN STREAM THE COOL OF THE SUMMER SUN AND THEN MANCUB AND THEN AND THEN THEY GAVE ME NUTS AND PLEASANT THINGS TO EAT AND THEYTHEY CARRIED ME IN THEIR ARMS UP TO THE TOP OF THE TREES AND SAID I WAS THEIR BLOOD BROTHER EXCEPT THAT I HAD NO TAIL AND SHOULD BE THEIR LEADER SOME DAY THEY HAVE NO LEADER SAID BAGHEERA THEY LIE THEY HAVE ALWAYS LIED THEY WERE VERY KIND AND BADE ME COME AGAIN WHY HAVE I NEVER BEEN TAKEN AMONG THE MONKEY PEOPLE THEY STAND ON THEIR FEET AS I DO THEY DO NOT HIT ME WITH THEIR HARD PAWS THEY PLAY ALL DAY LET ME GET UP BAD BALOO LET ME UP I WILL PLAY WITH THEM AGAIN LISTEN MANCUB SAID THE BEAR AND HIS VOICE RUMBLED LIKE THUNDER ON A HOT NIGHT I HAVE TAUGHT THEE ALL THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE FOR ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE JUNGLEEXCEPT THE MONKEYFOLK WHO LIVE IN THE TREES THEY HAVE NO LAW THEY ARE OUTCASTS THEY HAVE NO SPEECH OF THEIR OWN BUT USE THE STOLEN WORDS WHICH THEY OVERHEAR WHEN THEY LISTEN AND PEEP AND WAIT UP ABOVE IN THE BRANCHES THEIR WAY IS NOT OUR WAY THEY ARE WITHOUT LEADERS THEY HAVE NO REMEMBRANCE THEY BOAST AND CHATTER AND PRETEND THAT THEY ARE A GREAT PEOPLE ABOUT TO DO GREAT AFFAIRS IN THE JUNGLE BUT THE FALLING OF A NUT TURNS THEIR MINDS TO LAUGHTER AND ALL IS FORGOTTEN WE OF THE JUNGLE HAVE NO DEALINGS WITH THEM WE DO NOT DRINK WHERE THE MONKEYS DRINK WE DO NOT GO WHERE THE MONKEYS GO WE DO NOT HUNT WHERE THEY HUNT WE DO NOT DIE WHERE THEY DIE HAST THOU EVER HEARD ME SPEAK OF THE BANDARLOG TILL TODAY NO SAID MOWGLI IN A WHISPER FOR THE FOREST WAS VERY STILL NOW BALOO HAD FINISHED THE JUNGLEPEOPLE PUT THEM OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS AND OUT OF THEIR MINDS THEY ARE VERY MANY EVIL DIRTY SHAMELESS AND THEY DESIRE IF THEY HAVE ANY FIXED DESIRE TO BE NOTICED BY THE JUNGLE PEOPLE BUT WE DO NOT NOTICE THEM EVEN WHEN THEY THROW NUTS AND FILTH ON OUR HEADS HE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN WHEN A SHOWER OF NUTS AND TWIGS SPATTERED DOWN THROUGH THE BRANCHES AND THEY COULD HEAR COUGHINGS AND HOWLINGS AND ANGRY JUMPINGS HIGH UP IN THE AIR AMONG THE THIN BRANCHES THE MONKEYPEOPLE ARE FORBIDDEN SAID BALOO FORBIDDEN TO THE JUNGLEPEOPLE REMEMBER FORBIDDEN SAID BAGHEERA BUT I STILL THINK BALOO SHOULD HAVE WARNED THEE AGAINST THEM II HOW WAS I TO GUESS HE WOULD PLAY WITH SUCH DIRT THE MONKEY PEOPLE FAUGH A FRESH SHOWER CAME DOWN ON THEIR HEADS AND THE TWO TROTTED AWAY TAKING MOWGLI WITH THEM WHAT BALOO HAD SAID ABOUT THE MONKEYS WAS PERFECTLY TRUE THEY BELONGED TO THE TREETOPS AND AS BEASTS VERY SELDOM LOOK UP THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THE MONKEYS AND THE JUNGLEPEOPLE TO CROSS EACH OTHERS PATH BUT WHENEVER THEY FOUND A SICK WOLF OR A WOUNDED TIGER OR BEAR THE MONKEYS WOULD TORMENT HIM AND WOULD THROW STICKS AND NUTS AT ANY BEAST FOR FUN AND IN THE HOPE OF BEING NOTICED THEN THEY WOULD HOWL AND SHRIEK SENSELESS SONGS AND INVITE THE JUNGLEPEOPLE TO CLIMB UP THEIR TREES AND FIGHT THEM OR WOULD START FURIOUS BATTLES OVER NOTHING AMONG THEMSELVES AND LEAVE THE DEAD MONKEYS WHERE THE JUNGLEPEOPLE COULD SEE THEM THEY WERE ALWAYS JUST GOING TO HAVE A LEADER AND LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF THEIR OWN BUT THEY NEVER DID BECAUSE THEIR MEMORIES WOULD NOT HOLD OVER FROM DAY TO DAY AND SO THEY COMPROMISED THINGS BY MAKING UP A SAYING WHAT THE BANDARLOG THINK NOW THE JUNGLE WILL THINK LATER AND THAT COMFORTED THEM A GREAT DEAL NONE OF THE BEASTS COULD REACH THEM BUT ON THE OTHER HAND NONE OF THE BEASTS WOULD NOTICE THEM AND THAT WAS WHY THEY WERE SO PLEASED WHEN MOWGLI CAME TO PLAY WITH THEM AND THEY HEARD HOW ANGRY BALOO WAS THEY NEVER MEANT TO DO ANY MORETHE BANDARLOG NEVER MEAN ANYTHING AT ALL BUT ONE OF THEM INVENTED WHAT SEEMED TO HIM A BRILLIANT IDEA AND HE TOLD ALL THE OTHERS THAT MOWGLI WOULD BE A USEFUL PERSON TO KEEP IN THE TRIBE BECAUSE HE COULD WEAVE STICKS TOGETHER FOR PROTECTION FROM THE WIND SO IF THEY CAUGHT HIM THEY COULD MAKE HIM TEACH THEM OF COURSE MOWGLI AS A WOODCUTTERS CHILD INHERITED ALL SORTS OF INSTINCTS AND USED TO MAKE LITTLE HUTS OF FALLEN BRANCHES WITHOUT THINKING HOW HE CAME TO DO IT THE MONKEYPEOPLE WATCHING IN THE TREES CONSIDERED HIS PLAY MOST WONDERFUL THIS TIME THEY SAID THEY WERE REALLY GOING TO HAVE A LEADER AND BECOME THE WISEST PEOPLE IN THE JUNGLESO WISE THAT EVERYONE ELSE WOULD NOTICE AND ENVY THEM THEREFORE THEY FOLLOWED BALOO AND BAGHEERA AND MOWGLI THROUGH THE JUNGLE VERY QUIETLY TILL IT WAS TIME FOR THE MIDDAY NAP AND MOWGLI WHO WAS VERY MUCH ASHAMED OF HIMSELF SLEPT BETWEEN THE PANTHER AND THE BEAR RESOLVING TO HAVE NO MORE TO DO WITH THE MONKEY PEOPLE THE NEXT THING HE REMEMBERED WAS FEELING HANDS ON HIS LEGS AND ARMSHARD STRONG LITTLE HANDSAND THEN A SWASH OF BRANCHES IN HIS FACE AND THEN HE WAS STARING DOWN THROUGH THE SWAYING BOUGHS AS BALOO WOKE THE JUNGLE WITH HIS DEEP CRIES AND BAGHEERA BOUNDED UP THE TRUNK WITH EVERY TOOTH BARED THE BANDARLOG HOWLED WITH TRIUMPH AND SCUFFLED AWAY TO THE UPPER BRANCHES WHERE BAGHEERA DARED NOT FOLLOW SHOUTING HE HAS NOTICED US BAGHEERA HAS NOTICED US ALL THE JUNGLEPEOPLE ADMIRE US FOR OUR SKILL AND OUR CUNNING THEN THEY BEGAN THEIR FLIGHT AND THE FLIGHT OF THE MONKEYPEOPLE THROUGH TREELAND IS ONE OF THE THINGS NOBODY CAN DESCRIBE THEY HAVE THEIR REGULAR ROADS AND CROSSROADS UP HILLS AND DOWN HILLS ALL LAID OUT FROM FIFTY TO SEVENTY OR A HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND AND BY THESE THEY CAN TRAVEL EVEN AT NIGHT IF NECESSARY TWO OF THE STRONGEST MONKEYS CAUGHT MOWGLI UNDER THE ARMS AND SWUNG OFF WITH HIM THROUGH THE TREETOPS TWENTY FEET AT A BOUND HAD THEY BEEN ALONE THEY COULD HAVE GONE TWICE AS FAST BUT THE BOYS WEIGHT HELD THEM BACK SICK AND GIDDY AS MOWGLI WAS HE COULD NOT HELP ENJOYING THE WILD RUSH THOUGH THE GLIMPSES OF EARTH FAR DOWN BELOW FRIGHTENED HIM AND THE TERRIBLE CHECK AND JERK AT THE END OF THE SWING OVER NOTHING BUT EMPTY AIR BROUGHT HIS HEART BETWEEN HIS TEETH HIS ESCORT WOULD RUSH HIM UP A TREE TILL HE FELT THE THINNEST TOPMOST BRANCHES CRACKLE AND BEND UNDER THEM AND THEN WITH A COUGH AND A WHOOP WOULD FLING THEMSELVES INTO THE AIR OUTWARD AND DOWNWARD AND BRING UP HANGING BY THEIR HANDS OR THEIR FEET TO THE LOWER LIMBS OF THE NEXT TREE SOMETIMES HE COULD SEE FOR MILES AND MILES ACROSS THE STILL GREEN JUNGLE AS A MAN ON THE TOP OF A MAST CAN SEE FOR MILES ACROSS THE SEA AND THEN THE BRANCHES AND LEAVES WOULD LASH HIM ACROSS THE FACE AND HE AND HIS TWO GUARDS WOULD BE ALMOST DOWN TO EARTH AGAIN SO BOUNDING AND CRASHING AND WHOOPING AND YELLING THE WHOLE TRIBE OF BANDARLOG SWEPT ALONG THE TREEROADS WITH MOWGLI THEIR PRISONER FOR A TIME HE WAS AFRAID OF BEING DROPPED THEN HE GREW ANGRY BUT KNEW BETTER THAN TO STRUGGLE AND THEN HE BEGAN TO THINK THE FIRST THING WAS TO SEND BACK WORD TO BALOO AND BAGHEERA FOR AT THE PACE THE MONKEYS WERE GOING HE KNEW HIS FRIENDS WOULD BE LEFT FAR BEHIND IT WAS USELESS TO LOOK DOWN FOR HE COULD ONLY SEE THE TOPSIDES OF THE BRANCHES SO HE STARED UPWARD AND SAW FAR AWAY IN THE BLUE RANN THE KITE BALANCING AND WHEELING AS HE KEPT WATCH OVER THE JUNGLE WAITING FOR THINGS TO DIE RANN SAW THAT THE MONKEYS WERE CARRYING SOMETHING AND DROPPED A FEW HUNDRED YARDS TO FIND OUT WHETHER THEIR LOAD WAS GOOD TO EAT HE WHISTLED WITH SURPRISE WHEN HE SAW MOWGLI BEING DRAGGED UP TO A TREETOP AND HEARD HIM GIVE THE KITE CALL FORWE BE OF ONE BLOOD THOU AND I THE WAVES OF THE BRANCHES CLOSED OVER THE BOY BUT RANN BALANCED AWAY TO THE NEXT TREE IN TIME TO SEE THE LITTLE BROWN FACE COME UP AGAIN MARK MY TRAIL MOWGLI SHOUTED TELL BALOO OF THE SEEONEE PACK AND BAGHEERA OF THE COUNCIL ROCK IN WHOSE NAME BROTHER RANN HAD NEVER SEEN MOWGLI BEFORE THOUGH OF COURSE HE HAD HEARD OF HIM MOWGLI THE FROG MANCUB THEY CALL ME MARK MY TRAIL THE LAST WORDS WERE SHRIEKED AS HE WAS BEING SWUNG THROUGH THE AIR BUT RANN NODDED AND ROSE UP TILL HE LOOKED NO BIGGER THAN A SPECK OF DUST AND THERE HE HUNG WATCHING WITH HIS TELESCOPE EYES THE SWAYING OF THE TREETOPS AS MOWGLIS ESCORT WHIRLED ALONG THEY NEVER GO FAR HE SAID WITH A CHUCKLE THEY NEVER DO WHAT THEY SET OUT TO DO ALWAYS PECKING AT NEW THINGS ARE THE BANDARLOG THIS TIME IF I HAVE ANY EYESIGHT THEY HAVE PECKED DOWN TROUBLE FOR THEMSELVES FOR BALOO IS NO FLEDGLING AND BAGHEERA CAN AS I KNOW KILL MORE THAN GOATS SO HE ROCKED ON HIS WINGS HIS FEET GATHERED UP UNDER HIM AND WAITED MEANTIME BALOO AND BAGHEERA WERE FURIOUS WITH RAGE AND GRIEF BAGHEERA CLIMBED AS HE HAD NEVER CLIMBED BEFORE BUT THE THIN BRANCHES BROKE BENEATH HIS WEIGHT AND HE SLIPPED DOWN HIS CLAWS FULL OF BARK WHY DIDST THOU NOT WARN THE MANCUB HE ROARED TO POOR BALOO WHO HAD SET OFF AT A CLUMSY TROT IN THE HOPE OF OVERTAKING THE MONKEYS WHAT WAS THE USE OF HALF SLAYING HIM WITH BLOWS IF THOU DIDST NOT WARN HIM HASTE O HASTE WEWE MAY CATCH THEM YET BALOO PANTED AT THAT SPEED IT WOULD NOT TIRE A WOUNDED COW TEACHER OF THE LAWCUBBEATERA MILE OF THAT ROLLING TO AND FRO WOULD BURST THEE OPEN SIT STILL AND THINK MAKE A PLAN THIS IS NO TIME FOR CHASING THEY MAY DROP HIM IF WE FOLLOW TOO CLOSE ARRULA WHOO THEY MAY HAVE DROPPED HIM ALREADY BEING TIRED OF CARRYING HIM WHO CAN TRUST THE BANDARLOG PUT DEAD BATS ON MY HEAD GIVE ME BLACK BONES TO EAT ROLL ME INTO THE HIVES OF THE WILD BEES THAT I MAY BE STUNG TO DEATH AND BURY ME WITH THE HYAENA FOR I AM MOST MISERABLE OF BEARS ARULALA WAHOOA O MOWGLI MOWGLI WHY DID I NOT WARN THEE AGAINST THE MONKEYFOLK INSTEAD OF BREAKING THY HEAD NOW PERHAPS I MAY HAVE KNOCKED THE DAYS LESSON OUT OF HIS MIND AND HE WILL BE ALONE IN THE JUNGLE WITHOUT THE MASTER WORDS BALOO CLASPED HIS PAWS OVER HIS EARS AND ROLLED TO AND FRO MOANING AT LEAST HE GAVE ME ALL THE WORDS CORRECTLY A LITTLE TIME AGO SAID BAGHEERA IMPATIENTLY BALOO THOU HAST NEITHER MEMORY NOR RESPECT WHAT WOULD THE JUNGLE THINK IF I THE BLACK PANTHER CURLED MYSELF UP LIKE IKKI THE PORCUPINE AND HOWLED WHAT DO I CARE WHAT THE JUNGLE THINKS HE MAY BE DEAD BY NOW UNLESS AND UNTIL THEY DROP HIM FROM THE BRANCHES IN SPORT OR KILL HIM OUT OF IDLENESS I HAVE NO FEAR FOR THE MANCUB HE IS WISE AND WELL TAUGHT AND ABOVE ALL HE HAS THE EYES THAT MAKE THE JUNGLEPEOPLE AFRAID BUT AND IT IS A GREAT EVIL HE IS IN THE POWER OF THE BANDARLOG AND THEY BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN TREES HAVE NO FEAR OF ANY OF OUR PEOPLE BAGHEERA LICKED ONE FOREPAW

THE SHORTEST ROAD WITH HIS STEADY EYES AND KEEPING TO IT IN THE COLD LAIRS THE MONKEYPEOPLE WERE NOT THINKING OF MOWGLIS FRIENDS AT ALL THEY HAD BROUGHT THE BOY TO THE LOST CITY AND WERE VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES FOR THE TIME MOWGLI HAD NEVER SEEN AN INDIAN CITY BEFORE AND THOUGH THIS WAS ALMOST A HEAP OF RUINS IT SEEMED VERY WONDERFUL AND SPLENDID SOME KING HAD BUILT IT LONG AGO ON A LITTLE HILL YOU COULD STILL TRACE THE STONE CAUSEWAYS THAT LED UP TO THE RUINED GATES WHERE THE LAST SPLINTERS OF WOOD HUNG TO THE WORN RUSTED HINGES TREES HAD GROWN INTO AND OUT OF THE WALLS THE BATTLEMENTS WERE TUMBLED DOWN AND DECAYED AND WILD CREEPERS HUNG OUT OF THE WINDOWS OF THE TOWERS ON THE WALLS IN BUSHY HANGING CLUMPS A GREAT ROOFLESS PALACE CROWNED THE HILL AND THE MARBLE OF THE COURTYARDS AND THE FOUNTAINS WAS SPLIT AND STAINED WITH RED AND GREEN AND THE VERY COBBLESTONES IN THE COURTYARD WHERE THE KINGS ELEPHANTS USED TO LIVE HAD BEEN THRUST UP AND APART BY GRASSES AND YOUNG TREES FROM THE PALACE YOU COULD SEE THE ROWS AND ROWS OF ROOFLESS HOUSES THAT MADE UP THE CITY LOOKING LIKE EMPTY HONEYCOMBS FILLED WITH BLACKNESS THE SHAPELESS BLOCK OF STONE THAT HAD BEEN AN IDOL IN THE SQUARE WHERE FOUR ROADS MET THE PITS AND DIMPLES AT STREET CORNERS WHERE THE PUBLIC WELLS ONCE STOOD AND THE SHATTERED DOMES OF TEMPLES WITH WILD FIGS SPROUTING ON THEIR SIDES THE MONKEYS CALLED THE PLACE THEIR CITY AND PRETENDED TO DESPISE THE JUNGLEPEOPLE BECAUSE THEY LIVED IN THE FOREST AND YET THEY NEVER KNEW WHAT THE BUILDINGS WERE MADE FOR NOR HOW TO USE THEM THEY WOULD SIT IN CIRCLES ON THE HALL OF THE KINGS COUNCIL CHAMBER AND SCRATCH FOR FLEAS AND PRETEND TO BE MEN OR THEY WOULD RUN IN AND OUT OF THE ROOFLESS HOUSES AND COLLECT PIECES OF PLASTER AND OLD BRICKS IN A CORNER AND FORGET WHERE THEY HAD HIDDEN THEM AND FIGHT AND CRY IN SCUFFLING CROWDS AND THEN BREAK OFF TO PLAY UP AND DOWN THE TERRACES OF THE KINGS GARDEN WHERE THEY WOULD SHAKE THE ROSE TREES AND THE ORANGES IN SPORT TO SEE THE FRUIT AND FLOWERS FALL THEY EXPLORED ALL THE PASSAGES AND DARK TUNNELS IN THE PALACE AND THE HUNDREDS OF LITTLE DARK ROOMS BUT THEY NEVER REMEMBERED WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AND WHAT THEY HAD NOT AND SO DRIFTED ABOUT IN ONES AND TWOS OR CROWDS TELLING EACH OTHER THAT THEY WERE DOING AS MEN DID THEY DRANK AT THE TANKS AND MADE THE WATER ALL MUDDY AND THEN THEY FOUGHT OVER IT AND THEN THEY WOULD ALL RUSH TOGETHER IN MOBS AND SHOUT THERE IS NO ONE IN THE JUNGLE SO WISE AND GOOD AND CLEVER AND STRONG AND GENTLE AS THE BANDARLOG THEN ALL WOULD BEGIN AGAIN TILL THEY GREW TIRED OF THE CITY AND WENT BACK TO THE TREETOPS HOPING THE JUNGLEPEOPLE WOULD NOTICE THEM MOWGLI WHO HAD BEEN TRAINED UNDER THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE DID NOT LIKE OR UNDERSTAND THIS KIND OF LIFE THE MONKEYS DRAGGED HIM INTO THE COLD LAIRS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND INSTEAD OF GOING TO SLEEP AS MOWGLI WOULD HAVE DONE AFTER A LONG JOURNEY THEY JOINED HANDS AND DANCED ABOUT AND SANG THEIR FOOLISH SONGS ONE OF THE MONKEYS MADE A SPEECH AND TOLD HIS COMPANIONS THAT MOWGLIS CAPTURE MARKED A NEW THING IN THE HISTORY OF THE BANDARLOG FOR MOWGLI WAS GOING TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE STICKS AND CANES TOGETHER AS A PROTECTION AGAINST RAIN AND COLD MOWGLI PICKED UP SOME CREEPERS AND BEGAN TO WORK THEM IN AND OUT AND THE MONKEYS TRIED TO IMITATE BUT IN A VERY FEW MINUTES THEY LOST INTEREST AND BEGAN TO PULL THEIR FRIENDS TAILS OR JUMP UP AND DOWN ON ALL FOURS COUGHING I WISH TO EAT SAID MOWGLI I AM A STRANGER IN THIS PART OF THE JUNGLE BRING ME FOOD OR GIVE ME LEAVE TO HUNT HERE TWENTY OR THIRTY MONKEYS BOUNDED AWAY TO BRING HIM NUTS AND WILD PAWPAWS BUT THEY FELL TO FIGHTING ON THE ROAD AND IT WAS TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO GO BACK WITH WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE FRUIT MOWGLI WAS SORE AND ANGRY AS WELL AS HUNGRY AND HE ROAMED THROUGH THE EMPTY CITY GIVING THE STRANGERS HUNTING CALL FROM TIME TO TIME BUT NO ONE ANSWERED HIM AND MOWGLI FELT THAT HE HAD REACHED A VERY BAD PLACE INDEED ALL THAT BALOO HAS SAID ABOUT THE BANDARLOG IS TRUE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THEY HAVE NO LAW NO HUNTING CALL AND NO LEADERSNOTHING BUT FOOLISH WORDS AND LITTLE PICKING THIEVISH HANDS SO IF I AM STARVED OR KILLED HERE IT WILL BE ALL MY OWN FAULT BUT I MUST TRY TO RETURN TO MY OWN JUNGLE BALOO WILL SURELY BEAT ME BUT THAT IS BETTER THAN CHASING SILLY ROSE LEAVES WITH THE BANDARLOG NO SOONER HAD HE WALKED TO THE CITY WALL THAN THE MONKEYS PULLED HIM BACK TELLING HIM THAT HE DID NOT KNOW HOW HAPPY HE WAS AND PINCHING HIM TO MAKE HIM GRATEFUL HE SET HIS TEETH AND SAID NOTHING BUT WENT WITH THE SHOUTING MONKEYS TO A TERRACE ABOVE THE RED SANDSTONE RESERVOIRS THAT WERE HALFFULL OF RAIN WATER THERE WAS A RUINED SUMMERHOUSE OF WHITE MARBLE IN THE CENTER OF THE TERRACE BUILT FOR QUEENS DEAD A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE DOMED ROOF HAD HALF FALLEN IN AND BLOCKED UP THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE FROM THE PALACE BY WHICH THE QUEENS USED TO ENTER BUT THE WALLS WERE MADE OF SCREENS OF MARBLE TRACERYBEAUTIFUL MILKWHITE FRETWORK SET WITH AGATES AND CORNELIANS AND JASPER AND LAPIS LAZULI AND AS THE MOON CAME UP BEHIND THE HILL IT SHONE THROUGH THE OPEN WORK CASTING SHADOWS ON THE GROUND LIKE BLACK VELVET EMBROIDERY SORE SLEEPY AND HUNGRY AS HE WAS MOWGLI COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING WHEN THE BANDARLOG BEGAN TWENTY AT A TIME TO TELL HIM HOW GREAT AND WISE AND STRONG AND GENTLE THEY WERE AND HOW FOOLISH HE WAS TO WISH TO LEAVE THEM WE ARE GREAT WE ARE FREE WE ARE WONDERFUL WE ARE THE MOST WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN ALL THE JUNGLE WE ALL SAY SO AND SO IT MUST BE TRUE THEY SHOUTED NOW AS YOU ARE A NEW LISTENER AND CAN CARRY OUR WORDS BACK TO THE JUNGLEPEOPLE SO THAT THEY MAY NOTICE US IN FUTURE WE WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT OUR MOST EXCELLENT SELVES MOWGLI MADE NO OBJECTION AND THE MONKEYS GATHERED BY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS ON THE TERRACE TO LISTEN TO THEIR OWN SPEAKERS SINGING THE PRAISES OF THE BANDARLOG AND WHENEVER A SPEAKER STOPPED FOR WANT OF BREATH THEY WOULD ALL SHOUT TOGETHER THIS IS TRUE WE ALL SAY SO MOWGLI NODDED AND BLINKED AND SAID YES WHEN THEY ASKED HIM A QUESTION AND HIS HEAD SPUN WITH THE NOISE TABAQUI THE JACKAL MUST HAVE BITTEN ALL THESE PEOPLE HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND NOW THEY HAVE MADNESS CERTAINLY THIS IS DEWANEE THE MADNESS DO THEY NEVER GO TO SLEEP NOW THERE IS A CLOUD COMING TO COVER THAT MOON IF IT WERE ONLY A BIG ENOUGH CLOUD I MIGHT TRY TO RUN AWAY IN THE DARKNESS BUT I AM TIRED THAT SAME CLOUD WAS BEING WATCHED BY TWO GOOD FRIENDS IN THE RUINED DITCH BELOW THE CITY WALL FOR BAGHEERA AND KAA KNOWING WELL HOW DANGEROUS THE MONKEYPEOPLE WERE IN LARGE NUMBERS DID NOT WISH TO RUN ANY RISKS THE MONKEYS NEVER FIGHT UNLESS THEY ARE A HUNDRED TO ONE AND FEW IN THE JUNGLE CARE FOR THOSE ODDS I WILL GO TO THE WEST WALL KAA WHISPERED AND COME DOWN SWIFTLY WITH THE SLOPE OF THE GROUND IN MY FAVOR THEY WILL NOT THROW THEMSELVES UPON MY BACK IN THEIR HUNDREDS BUT I KNOW IT SAID BAGHEERA WOULD THAT BALOO WERE HERE BUT WE MUST DO WHAT WE CAN WHEN THAT CLOUD COVERS THE MOON I SHALL GO TO THE TERRACE THEY HOLD SOME SORT OF COUNCIL THERE OVER THE BOY GOOD HUNTING SAID KAA GRIMLY AND GLIDED AWAY TO THE WEST WALL THAT HAPPENED TO BE THE LEAST RUINED OF ANY AND THE BIG SNAKE WAS DELAYED AWHILE BEFORE HE COULD FIND A WAY UP THE STONES THE CLOUD HID THE MOON AND AS MOWGLI WONDERED WHAT WOULD COME NEXT HE HEARD BAGHEERAS LIGHT FEET ON THE TERRACE THE BLACK PANTHER HAD RACED UP THE SLOPE ALMOST WITHOUT A SOUND AND WAS STRIKINGHE KNEW BETTER THAN TO WASTE TIME IN BITINGRIGHT AND LEFT AMONG THE MONKEYS WHO WERE SEATED ROUND MOWGLI IN CIRCLES FIFTY AND SIXTY DEEP THERE WAS A HOWL OF FRIGHT AND RAGE AND THEN AS BAGHEERA TRIPPED ON THE ROLLING KICKING BODIES BENEATH HIM A MONKEY SHOUTED THERE IS ONLY ONE HERE KILL HIM KILL A SCUFFLING MASS OF MONKEYS BITING SCRATCHING TEARING AND PULLING CLOSED OVER BAGHEERA WHILE FIVE OR SIX LAID HOLD OF MOWGLI DRAGGED HIM UP THE WALL OF THE SUMMERHOUSE AND PUSHED HIM THROUGH THE HOLE OF THE BROKEN DOME A MANTRAINED BOY WOULD HAVE BEEN BADLY BRUISED FOR THE FALL WAS A GOOD FIFTEEN FEET BUT MOWGLI FELL AS BALOO HAD TAUGHT HIM TO FALL AND LANDED ON HIS FEET STAY THERE SHOUTED THE MONKEYS TILL WE HAVE KILLED THY FRIENDS AND LATER WE WILL PLAY WITH THEEIF THE POISONPEOPLE LEAVE THEE ALIVE WE BE OF ONE BLOOD YE AND I SAID MOWGLI QUICKLY GIVING THE SNAKES CALL HE COULD HEAR RUSTLING AND HISSING IN THE RUBBISH ALL ROUND HIM AND GAVE THE CALL A SECOND TIME TO MAKE SURE EVEN SSSO DOWN HOODS ALL SAID HALF A DOZEN LOW VOICES EVERY RUIN IN INDIA BECOMES SOONER OR LATER A DWELLING PLACE OF SNAKES AND THE OLD SUMMERHOUSE WAS ALIVE WITH COBRAS STAND STILL LITTLE BROTHER FOR THY FEET MAY DO US HARM MOWGLI STOOD AS QUIETLY AS HE COULD PEERING THROUGH THE OPEN WORK AND LISTENING TO THE FURIOUS DIN OF THE FIGHT ROUND THE BLACK PANTHERTHE YELLS AND CHATTERINGS AND SCUFFLINGS AND BAGHEERAS DEEP HOARSE COUGH AS HE BACKED AND BUCKED AND TWISTED AND PLUNGED UNDER THE HEAPS OF HIS ENEMIES FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE WAS BORN BAGHEERA WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE BALOO MUST BE AT HAND BAGHEERA WOULD NOT HAVE COME ALONE MOWGLI THOUGHT AND THEN HE CALLED ALOUD TO THE TANK BAGHEERA ROLL TO THE WATER TANKS ROLL AND PLUNGE GET TO THE WATER BAGHEERA HEARD AND THE CRY THAT TOLD HIM MOWGLI WAS SAFE GAVE HIM NEW COURAGE HE WORKED HIS WAY DESPERATELY INCH BY INCH STRAIGHT FOR THE RESERVOIRS HALTING IN SILENCE THEN FROM THE RUINED WALL NEAREST THE JUNGLE ROSE UP THE RUMBLING WARSHOUT OF BALOO THE OLD BEAR HAD DONE HIS BEST BUT HE COULD NOT COME BEFORE BAGHEERA HE SHOUTED I AM HERE I CLIMB I HASTE AHUWORA THE STONES SLIP UNDER MY FEET WAIT MY COMING O MOST INFAMOUS BANDARLOG HE PANTED UP THE TERRACE ONLY TO DISAPPEAR TO THE HEAD IN A WAVE OF MONKEYS BUT HE THREW HIMSELF SQUARELY ON HIS HAUNCHES AND SPREADING OUT HIS FOREPAWS HUGGED AS MANY AS HE COULD HOLD AND THEN BEGAN TO HIT WITH A REGULAR BATBATBAT LIKE THE FLIPPING STROKES OF A PADDLE WHEEL A CRASH AND A SPLASH TOLD MOWGLI THAT BAGHEERA HAD FOUGHT HIS WAY TO THE TANK WHERE THE MONKEYS COULD NOT FOLLOW THE PANTHER LAY GASPING FOR BREATH HIS HEAD JUST OUT OF THE WATER WHILE THE MONKEYS STOOD THREE DEEP ON THE RED STEPS DANCING UP AND DOWN WITH RAGE READY TO SPRING UPON HIM FROM ALL SIDES IF HE CAME OUT TO HELP BALOO IT WAS THEN THAT BAGHEERA LIFTED UP HIS DRIPPING CHIN AND IN DESPAIR GAVE THE SNAKES CALL FOR PROTECTIONWE BE OF ONE BLOOD YE AND IFOR HE BELIEVED THAT KAA HAD TURNED TAIL AT THE LAST MINUTE EVEN BALOO HALF SMOTHERED UNDER THE MONKEYS ON THE EDGE OF THE TERRACE COULD NOT HELP CHUCKLING AS HE HEARD THE BLACK PANTHER ASKING FOR HELP KAA HAD ONLY JUST WORKED HIS WAY OVER THE WEST WALL LANDING WITH A WRENCH THAT DISLODGED A COPING STONE INTO THE DITCH HE HAD NO INTENTION OF LOSING ANY ADVANTAGE OF THE GROUND AND COILED AND UNCOILED HIMSELF ONCE OR TWICE TO BE SURE THAT EVERY FOOT OF HIS LONG BODY WAS IN WORKING ORDER ALL THAT WHILE THE FIGHT WITH BALOO WENT ON AND THE MONKEYS YELLED IN THE TANK ROUND BAGHEERA AND MANG THE BAT FLYING TO AND FRO CARRIED THE NEWS OF THE GREAT BATTLE OVER THE JUNGLE TILL EVEN HATHI THE WILD ELEPHANT TRUMPETED AND FAR AWAY SCATTERED BANDS OF THE MONKEYFOLK WOKE AND CAME LEAPING ALONG THE TREEROADS TO HELP THEIR COMRADES IN THE COLD LAIRS AND THE NOISE OF THE FIGHT ROUSED ALL THE DAY BIRDS FOR MILES ROUND THEN KAA CAME STRAIGHT QUICKLY AND ANXIOUS TO KILL THE FIGHTING STRENGTH OF A PYTHON IS IN THE DRIVING BLOW OF HIS HEAD BACKED BY ALL THE STRENGTH AND WEIGHT OF HIS BODY IF YOU CAN IMAGINE A LANCE OR A BATTERING RAM OR A HAMMER WEIGHING NEARLY HALF A TON DRIVEN BY A COOL QUIET MIND LIVING IN THE HANDLE OF IT YOU CAN ROUGHLY IMAGINE WHAT KAA WAS LIKE WHEN HE FOUGHT A PYTHON FOUR OR FIVE FEET LONG CAN KNOCK A MAN DOWN IF HE HITS HIM FAIRLY IN THE CHEST AND KAA WAS THIRTY FEET LONG AS YOU KNOW HIS FIRST STROKE WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HEART OF THE CROWD ROUND BALOO IT WAS SENT HOME WITH SHUT MOUTH IN SILENCE AND THERE WAS NO NEED OF A SECOND THE MONKEYS SCATTERED WITH CRIES OFKAA IT IS KAA RUN RUN GENERATIONS OF MONKEYS HAD BEEN SCARED INTO GOOD BEHAVIOR BY THE STORIES THEIR ELDERS TOLD THEM OF KAA THE NIGHT THIEF WHO COULD SLIP ALONG THE BRANCHES AS QUIETLY AS MOSS GROWS AND STEAL AWAY THE STRONGEST MONKEY THAT EVER LIVED OF OLD KAA WHO COULD MAKE HIMSELF LOOK SO LIKE A DEAD BRANCH OR A ROTTEN STUMP THAT THE WISEST WERE DECEIVED TILL THE BRANCH CAUGHT THEM KAA WAS EVERYTHING THAT THE MONKEYS FEARED IN THE JUNGLE FOR NONE OF THEM KNEW THE LIMITS OF HIS POWER NONE OF THEM COULD LOOK HIM IN THE FACE AND NONE HAD EVER COME ALIVE OUT OF HIS HUG AND SO THEY RAN STAMMERING WITH TERROR TO THE WALLS AND THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES AND BALOO DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF HIS FUR WAS MUCH THICKER THAN BAGHEERAS BUT HE HAD SUFFERED SORELY IN THE FIGHT THEN KAA OPENED HIS MOUTH FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SPOKE ONE LONG HISSING WORD AND THE FARAWAY MONKEYS HURRYING TO THE DEFENSE OF THE COLD LAIRS STAYED WHERE THEY WERE COWERING TILL THE LOADED BRANCHES BENT AND CRACKLED UNDER THEM THE MONKEYS ON THE WALLS AND THE EMPTY HOUSES STOPPED THEIR CRIES AND IN THE STILLNESS THAT FELL UPON THE CITY MOWGLI HEARD BAGHEERA SHAKING HIS WET SIDES AS HE CAME UP FROM THE TANK THEN THE CLAMOR BROKE OUT AGAIN THE MONKEYS LEAPED HIGHER UP THE WALLS THEY CLUNG AROUND THE NECKS OF THE BIG STONE IDOLS AND SHRIEKED AS THEY SKIPPED ALONG THE BATTLEMENTS WHILE MOWGLI DANCING IN THE SUMMERHOUSE PUT HIS

FIRST TALE WHEN MOWGLI LEFT THE WOLFS CAVE AFTER THE FIGHT WITH THE PACK AT THE COUNCIL ROCK HE WENT DOWN TO THE PLOWED LANDS WHERE THE VILLAGERS LIVED BUT HE WOULD NOT STOP THERE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO NEAR TO THE JUNGLE AND HE KNEW THAT HE HAD MADE AT LEAST ONE BAD ENEMY AT THE COUNCIL SO HE HURRIED ON KEEPING TO THE ROUGH ROAD THAT RAN DOWN THE VALLEY AND FOLLOWED IT AT A STEADY JOGTROT FOR NEARLY TWENTY MILES TILL HE CAME TO A COUNTRY THAT HE DID NOT KNOW THE VALLEY OPENED OUT INTO A GREAT PLAIN DOTTED OVER WITH ROCKS AND CUT UP BY RAVINES AT ONE END STOOD A LITTLE VILLAGE AND AT THE OTHER THE THICK JUNGLE CAME DOWN IN A SWEEP TO THE GRAZINGGROUNDS AND STOPPED THERE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN CUT OFF WITH A HOE ALL OVER THE PLAIN CATTLE AND BUFFALOES WERE GRAZING AND WHEN THE LITTLE BOYS IN CHARGE OF THE HERDS SAW MOWGLI THEY SHOUTED AND RAN AWAY AND THE YELLOW PARIAH DOGS THAT HANG ABOUT EVERY INDIAN VILLAGE BARKED MOWGLI WALKED ON FOR HE WAS FEELING HUNGRY AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE VILLAGE GATE HE SAW THE BIG THORNBUSH THAT WAS DRAWN UP BEFORE THE GATE AT TWILIGHT PUSHED TO ONE SIDE UMPH HE SAID FOR HE HAD COME ACROSS MORE THAN ONE SUCH BARRICADE IN HIS NIGHT RAMBLES AFTER THINGS TO EAT SO MEN ARE AFRAID OF THE PEOPLE OF THE JUNGLE HERE ALSO HE SAT DOWN BY THE GATE AND WHEN A MAN CAME OUT HE STOOD UP OPENED HIS MOUTH AND POINTED DOWN IT TO SHOW THAT HE WANTED FOOD THE MAN STARED AND RAN BACK UP THE ONE STREET OF THE VILLAGE SHOUTING FOR THE PRIEST WHO WAS A BIG FAT MAN DRESSED IN WHITE WITH A RED AND YELLOW MARK ON HIS FOREHEAD THE PRIEST CAME TO THE GATE AND WITH HIM AT LEAST A HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO STARED AND TALKED AND SHOUTED AND POINTED AT MOWGLI THEY HAVE NO MANNERS THESE MEN FOLK SAID MOWGLI TO HIMSELF ONLY THE GRAY APE WOULD BEHAVE AS THEY DO SO HE THREW BACK HIS LONG HAIR AND FROWNED AT THE CROWD WHAT IS THERE TO BE AFRAID OF SAID THE PRIEST LOOK AT THE MARKS ON HIS ARMS AND LEGS THEY ARE THE BITES OF WOLVES HE IS BUT A WOLFCHILD RUN AWAY FROM THE JUNGLE OF COURSE IN PLAYING TOGETHER THE CUBS HAD OFTEN NIPPED MOWGLI HARDER THAN THEY INTENDED AND THERE WERE WHITE SCARS ALL OVER HIS ARMS AND LEGS BUT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD TO CALL THESE BITES FOR HE KNEW WHAT REAL BITING MEANT ARRE ARRE SAID TWO OR THREE WOMEN TOGETHER TO BE BITTEN BY WOLVES POOR CHILD HE IS A HANDSOME BOY HE HAS EYES LIKE RED FIRE BY MY HONOR MESSUA HE IS NOT UNLIKE THY BOY THAT WAS TAKEN BY THE TIGER LET ME LOOK SAID A WOMAN WITH HEAVY COPPER RINGS ON HER WRISTS AND ANKLES AND SHE PEERED AT MOWGLI UNDER THE PALM OF HER HAND INDEED HE IS NOT HE IS THINNER BUT HE HAS THE VERY LOOK OF MY BOY THE PRIEST WAS A CLEVER MAN AND HE KNEW THAT MESSUA WAS WIFE TO THE RICHEST VILLAGER IN THE PLACE SO HE LOOKED UP AT THE SKY FOR A MINUTE AND SAID SOLEMNLY WHAT THE JUNGLE HAS TAKEN THE JUNGLE HAS RESTORED TAKE THE BOY INTO THY HOUSE MY SISTER AND FORGET NOT TO HONOR THE PRIEST WHO SEES SO FAR INTO THE LIVES OF MEN BY THE BULL THAT BOUGHT ME SAID MOWGLI TO HIMSELF BUT ALL THIS TALKING IS LIKE ANOTHER LOOKINGOVER BY THE PACK WELL IF I AM A MAN A MAN I MUST BECOME THE CROWD PARTED AS THE WOMAN BECKONED MOWGLI TO HER HUT WHERE THERE WAS A RED LACQUERED BEDSTEAD A GREAT EARTHEN GRAIN CHEST WITH FUNNY RAISED PATTERNS ON IT HALF A DOZEN COPPER COOKING POTS AN IMAGE OF A HINDU GOD IN A LITTLE ALCOVE AND ON THE WALL A REAL LOOKING GLASS SUCH AS THEY SELL AT THE COUNTRY FAIRS SHE GAVE HIM A LONG DRINK OF MILK AND SOME BREAD AND THEN SHE LAID HER HAND ON HIS HEAD AND LOOKED INTO HIS EYES FOR SHE THOUGHT PERHAPS THAT HE MIGHT BE HER REAL SON COME BACK FROM THE JUNGLE WHERE THE TIGER HAD TAKEN HIM SO SHE SAID NATHOO O NATHOO MOWGLI DID NOT SHOW THAT HE KNEW THE NAME DOST THOU NOT REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN I GAVE THEE THY NEW SHOES SHE TOUCHED HIS FOOT AND IT WAS ALMOST AS HARD AS HORN NO SHE SAID SORROWFULLY THOSE FEET HAVE NEVER WORN SHOES BUT THOU ART VERY LIKE MY NATHOO AND THOU SHALT BE MY SON MOWGLI WAS UNEASY BECAUSE HE HAD NEVER BEEN UNDER A ROOF BEFORE BUT AS HE LOOKED AT THE THATCH HE SAW THAT HE COULD TEAR IT OUT ANY TIME IF HE WANTED TO GET AWAY AND THAT THE WINDOW HAD NO FASTENINGS WHAT IS THE GOOD OF A MAN HE SAID TO HIMSELF AT LAST IF HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MANS TALK NOW I AM AS SILLY AND DUMB AS A MAN WOULD BE WITH US IN THE JUNGLE I MUST SPEAK THEIR TALK IT WAS NOT FOR FUN THAT HE HAD LEARNED WHILE HE WAS WITH THE WOLVES TO IMITATE THE CHALLENGE OF BUCKS IN THE JUNGLE AND THE GRUNT OF THE LITTLE WILD PIG SO AS SOON AS MESSUA PRONOUNCED A WORD MOWGLI WOULD IMITATE IT ALMOST PERFECTLY AND BEFORE DARK HE HAD LEARNED THE NAMES OF MANY THINGS IN THE HUT THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY AT BEDTIME BECAUSE MOWGLI WOULD NOT SLEEP UNDER ANYTHING THAT LOOKED SO LIKE A PANTHER TRAP AS THAT HUT AND WHEN THEY SHUT THE DOOR HE WENT THROUGH THE WINDOW GIVE HIM HIS WILL SAID MESSUAS HUSBAND REMEMBER HE CAN NEVER TILL NOW HAVE SLEPT ON A BED IF HE IS INDEED SENT IN THE PLACE OF OUR SON HE WILL NOT RUN AWAY SO MOWGLI STRETCHED HIMSELF IN SOME LONG CLEAN GRASS AT THE EDGE OF THE FIELD BUT BEFORE HE HAD CLOSED HIS EYES A SOFT GRAY NOSE POKED HIM UNDER THE CHIN PHEW SAID GRAY BROTHER HE WAS THE ELDEST OF MOTHER WOLFS CUBS THIS IS A POOR REWARD FOR FOLLOWING THEE TWENTY MILES THOU SMELLEST OF WOOD SMOKE AND CATTLEALTOGETHER LIKE A MAN ALREADY WAKE LITTLE BROTHER I BRING NEWS ARE ALL WELL IN THE JUNGLE SAID MOWGLI HUGGING HIM ALL EXCEPT THE WOLVES THAT WERE BURNED WITH THE RED FLOWER NOW LISTEN SHERE KHAN HAS GONE AWAY TO HUNT FAR OFF TILL HIS COAT GROWS AGAIN FOR HE IS BADLY SINGED WHEN HE RETURNS HE SWEARS THAT HE WILL LAY THY BONES IN THE WAINGUNGA THERE ARE TWO WORDS TO THAT I ALSO HAVE MADE A LITTLE PROMISE BUT NEWS IS ALWAYS GOOD I AM TIRED TONIGHTVERY TIRED WITH NEW THINGS GRAY BROTHERBUT BRING ME THE NEWS ALWAYS THOU WILT NOT FORGET THAT THOU ART A WOLF MEN WILL NOT MAKE THEE FORGET SAID GRAY BROTHER ANXIOUSLY NEVER I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT I LOVE THEE AND ALL IN OUR CAVE BUT ALSO I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT I HAVE BEEN CAST OUT OF THE PACK AND THAT THOU MAYEST BE CAST OUT OF ANOTHER PACK MEN ARE ONLY MEN LITTLE BROTHER AND THEIR TALK IS LIKE THE TALK OF FROGS IN A POND WHEN I COME DOWN HERE AGAIN I WILL WAIT FOR THEE IN THE BAMBOOS AT THE EDGE OF THE GRAZINGGROUND FOR THREE MONTHS AFTER THAT NIGHT MOWGLI HARDLY EVER LEFT THE VILLAGE GATE HE WAS SO BUSY LEARNING THE WAYS AND CUSTOMS OF MEN FIRST HE HAD TO WEAR A CLOTH ROUND HIM WHICH ANNOYED HIM HORRIBLY AND THEN HE HAD TO LEARN ABOUT MONEY WHICH HE DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND AND ABOUT PLOWING OF WHICH HE DID NOT SEE THE USE THEN THE LITTLE CHILDREN IN THE VILLAGE MADE HIM VERY ANGRY LUCKILY THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE HAD TAUGHT HIM TO KEEP HIS TEMPER FOR IN THE JUNGLE LIFE AND FOOD DEPEND ON KEEPING YOUR TEMPER BUT WHEN THEY MADE FUN OF HIM BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT PLAY GAMES OR FLY KITES OR BECAUSE HE MISPRONOUNCED SOME WORD ONLY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS UNSPORTSMANLIKE TO KILL LITTLE NAKED CUBS KEPT HIM FROM PICKING THEM UP AND BREAKING THEM IN TWO HE DID NOT KNOW HIS OWN STRENGTH IN THE LEAST IN THE JUNGLE HE KNEW HE WAS WEAK COMPARED WITH THE BEASTS BUT IN THE VILLAGE PEOPLE SAID THAT HE WAS AS STRONG AS A BULL AND MOWGLI HAD NOT THE FAINTEST IDEA OF THE DIFFERENCE THAT CASTE MAKES BETWEEN MAN AND MAN WHEN THE POTTERS DONKEY SLIPPED IN THE CLAY PIT MOWGLI HAULED IT OUT BY THE TAIL AND HELPED TO STACK THE POTS FOR THEIR JOURNEY TO THE MARKET AT KHANHIWARA THAT WAS VERY SHOCKING TOO FOR THE POTTER IS A LOWCASTE MAN AND HIS DONKEY IS WORSE WHEN THE PRIEST SCOLDED HIM MOWGLI THREATENED TO PUT HIM ON THE DONKEY TOO AND THE PRIEST TOLD MESSUAS HUSBAND THAT MOWGLI HAD BETTER BE SET TO WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THE VILLAGE HEADMAN TOLD MOWGLI THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO OUT WITH THE BUFFALOES NEXT DAY AND HERD THEM WHILE THEY GRAZED NO ONE WAS MORE PLEASED THAN MOWGLI AND THAT NIGHT BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED A SERVANT OF THE VILLAGE AS IT WERE HE WENT OFF TO A CIRCLE THAT MET EVERY EVENING ON A MASONRY PLATFORM UNDER A GREAT FIGTREE IT WAS THE VILLAGE CLUB AND THE HEADMAN AND THE WATCHMAN AND THE BARBER WHO KNEW ALL THE GOSSIP OF THE VILLAGE AND OLD BULDEO THE VILLAGE HUNTER WHO HAD A TOWER MUSKET MET AND SMOKED THE MONKEYS SAT AND TALKED IN THE UPPER BRANCHES AND THERE WAS A HOLE UNDER THE PLATFORM WHERE A COBRA LIVED AND HE HAD HIS LITTLE PLATTER OF MILK EVERY NIGHT BECAUSE HE WAS SACRED AND THE OLD MEN SAT AROUND THE TREE AND TALKED AND PULLED AT THE BIG HUQAS THE WATERPIPES TILL FAR INTO THE NIGHT THEY TOLD WONDERFUL TALES OF GODS AND MEN AND GHOSTS AND BULDEO TOLD EVEN MORE WONDERFUL ONES OF THE WAYS OF BEASTS IN THE JUNGLE TILL THE EYES OF THE CHILDREN SITTING OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE BULGED OUT OF THEIR HEADS MOST OF THE TALES WERE ABOUT ANIMALS FOR THE JUNGLE WAS ALWAYS AT THEIR DOOR THE DEER AND THE WILD PIG GRUBBED UP THEIR CROPS AND NOW AND AGAIN THE TIGER CARRIED OFF A MAN AT TWILIGHT WITHIN SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE GATES MOWGLI WHO NATURALLY KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE TALKING OF HAD TO COVER HIS FACE NOT TO SHOW THAT HE WAS LAUGHING WHILE BULDEO THE TOWER MUSKET ACROSS HIS KNEES CLIMBED ON FROM ONE WONDERFUL STORY TO ANOTHER AND MOWGLIS SHOULDERS SHOOK BULDEO WAS EXPLAINING HOW THE TIGER THAT HAD CARRIED AWAY MESSUAS SON WAS A GHOSTTIGER AND HIS BODY WAS INHABITED BY THE GHOST OF A WICKED OLD MONEYLENDER WHO HAD DIED SOME YEARS AGO AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS TRUE HE SAID BECAUSE PURUN DASS ALWAYS LIMPED FROM THE BLOW THAT HE GOT IN A RIOT WHEN HIS ACCOUNT BOOKS WERE BURNED AND THE TIGER THAT I SPEAK OF HE LIMPS TOO FOR THE TRACKS OF HIS PADS ARE UNEQUAL TRUE TRUE THAT MUST BE THE TRUTH SAID THE GRAYBEARDS NODDING TOGETHER ARE ALL THESE TALES SUCH COBWEBS AND MOON TALK SAID MOWGLI THAT TIGER LIMPS BECAUSE HE WAS BORN LAME AS EVERYONE KNOWS TO TALK OF THE SOUL OF A MONEYLENDER IN A BEAST THAT NEVER HAD THE COURAGE OF A JACKAL IS CHILDS TALK BULDEO WAS SPEECHLESS WITH SURPRISE FOR A MOMENT AND THE HEADMAN STARED OHO IT IS THE JUNGLE BRAT IS IT SAID BULDEO IF THOU ART SO WISE BETTER BRING HIS HIDE TO KHANHIWARA FOR THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET A HUNDRED RUPEES ON HIS LIFE BETTER STILL TALK NOT WHEN THY ELDERS SPEAK MOWGLI ROSE TO GO ALL THE EVENING I HAVE LAIN HERE LISTENING HE CALLED BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AND EXCEPT ONCE OR TWICE BULDEO HAS NOT SAID ONE WORD OF TRUTH CONCERNING THE JUNGLE WHICH IS AT HIS VERY DOORS HOW THEN SHALL I BELIEVE THE TALES OF GHOSTS AND GODS AND GOBLINS WHICH HE SAYS HE HAS SEEN IT IS FULL TIME THAT BOY WENT TO HERDING SAID THE HEADMAN WHILE BULDEO PUFFED AND SNORTED AT MOWGLIS IMPERTINENCE THE CUSTOM OF MOST INDIAN VILLAGES IS FOR A FEW BOYS TO TAKE THE CATTLE AND BUFFALOES OUT TO GRAZE IN THE EARLY MORNING AND BRING THEM BACK AT NIGHT THE VERY CATTLE THAT WOULD TRAMPLE A WHITE MAN TO DEATH ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE BANGED AND BULLIED AND SHOUTED AT BY CHILDREN THAT HARDLY COME UP TO THEIR NOSES SO LONG AS THE BOYS KEEP WITH THE HERDS THEY ARE SAFE FOR NOT EVEN THE TIGER WILL CHARGE A MOB OF CATTLE BUT IF THEY STRAGGLE TO PICK FLOWERS OR HUNT LIZARDS THEY ARE SOMETIMES CARRIED OFF MOWGLI WENT THROUGH THE VILLAGE STREET IN THE DAWN SITTING ON THE BACK OF RAMA THE GREAT HERD BULL THE SLATYBLUE BUFFALOES WITH THEIR LONG BACKWARDSWEEPING HORNS AND SAVAGE EYES ROSE OUT THEIR BYRES ONE BY ONE AND FOLLOWED HIM AND MOWGLI MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO THE CHILDREN WITH HIM THAT HE WAS THE MASTER HE BEAT THE BUFFALOES WITH A LONG POLISHED BAMBOO AND TOLD KAMYA ONE OF THE BOYS TO GRAZE THE CATTLE BY THEMSELVES WHILE HE WENT ON WITH THE BUFFALOES AND TO BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO STRAY AWAY FROM THE HERD AN INDIAN GRAZING GROUND IS ALL ROCKS AND SCRUB AND TUSSOCKS AND LITTLE RAVINES AMONG WHICH THE HERDS SCATTER AND DISAPPEAR THE BUFFALOES GENERALLY KEEP TO THE POOLS AND MUDDY PLACES WHERE THEY LIE WALLOWING OR BASKING IN THE WARM MUD FOR HOURS MOWGLI DROVE THEM ON TO THE EDGE OF THE PLAIN WHERE THE WAINGUNGA CAME OUT OF THE JUNGLE THEN HE DROPPED FROM RAMAS NECK TROTTED OFF TO A BAMBOO CLUMP AND FOUND GRAY BROTHER AH SAID GRAY BROTHER I HAVE WAITED HERE VERY MANY DAYS WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS CATTLEHERDING WORK IT IS AN ORDER SAID MOWGLI I AM A VILLAGE HERD FOR A WHILE WHAT NEWS OF SHERE KHAN HE HAS COME BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND HAS WAITED HERE A LONG TIME FOR THEE NOW HE HAS GONE OFF AGAIN FOR THE GAME IS SCARCE BUT HE MEANS TO KILL THEE VERY GOOD SAID MOWGLI SO LONG AS HE IS AWAY DO THOU OR ONE OF THE FOUR BROTHERS SIT ON THAT ROCK SO THAT I CAN SEE THEE AS I COME OUT OF THE VILLAGE WHEN HE COMES BACK WAIT FOR ME IN THE RAVINE BY THE DHAK TREE IN THE CENTER OF THE PLAIN WE NEED NOT WALK INTO SHERE KHANS MOUTH THEN MOWGLI PICKED OUT A SHADY PLACE AND LAY DOWN AND SLEPT WHILE THE BUFFALOES GRAZED ROUND HIM HERDING IN INDIA IS ONE OF THE LAZIEST THINGS IN THE WORLD THE CATTLE MOVE AND CRUNCH AND LIE DOWN AND MOVE ON AGAIN AND THEY DO NOT EVEN LOW THEY ONLY GRUNT AND THE BUFFALOES VERY SELDOM SAY ANYTHING BUT GET DOWN INTO THE MUDDY POOLS ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND WORK THEIR WAY INTO THE MUD TILL ONLY THEIR NOSES AND STARING CHINABLUE EYES SHOW ABOVE THE SURFACE AND THEN THEY LIE LIKE LOGS THE SUN MAKES THE ROCKS DANCE IN THE HEAT AND THE HERD CHILDREN HEAR ONE KITE NEVER ANY MORE WHISTLING ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT OVERHEAD AND THEY KNOW THAT IF THEY DIED OR A COW DIED THAT KITE WOULD SWEEP DOWN AND THE NEXT KITE MILES AWAY WOULD SEE HIM DROP AND FOLLOW AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT AND ALMOST BEFORE THEY WERE DEAD THERE WOULD BE A SCORE OF HUNGRY KITES COME OUT OF NOWHERE THEN THEY SLEEP AND WAKE AND SLEEP AGAIN AND WEAVE LITTLE BASKETS OF DRIED GRASS AND PUT GRASSHOPPERS IN THEM OR CATCH TWO PRAYING MANTISES AND MAKE THEM FIGHT OR STRING A NECKLACE OF RED AND BLACK JUNGLE NUTS OR WATCH A LIZARD BASKING ON A ROCK OR A SNAKE HUNTING A FROG NEAR THE WALLOWS THEN THEY SING LONG LONG SONGS WITH ODD NATIVE QUAVERS AT THE END OF THEM AND THE DAY SEEMS LONGER THAN MOST PEOPLES WHOLE LIVES AND PERHAPS THEY MAKE A MUD CASTLE WITH MUD FIGURES OF MEN AND HORSES AND BUFFALOES AND PUT REEDS INTO THE MENS HANDS AND PRETEND THAT THEY ARE KINGS AND THE FIGURES ARE THEIR ARMIES OR THAT THEY ARE GODS TO BE WORSHIPED THEN EVENING COMES AND THE CHILDREN CALL AND THE BUFFALOES LUMBER UP OUT OF THE STICKY MUD WITH NOISES LIKE GUNSHOTS GOING OFF ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND THEY ALL STRING ACROSS THE GRAY PLAIN BACK TO THE TWINKLING VILLAGE LIGHTS DAY AFTER DAY MOWGLI WOULD LEAD THE BUFFALOES OUT TO THEIR WALLOWS AND DAY AFTER DAY HE WOULD SEE GRAY BROTHERS BACK A MILE AND A HALF AWAY ACROSS THE PLAIN SO HE KNEW THAT SHERE KHAN HAD NOT COME BACK AND DAY AFTER DAY HE WOULD LIE ON THE GRASS LISTENING TO THE NOISES ROUND HIM AND DREAMING OF OLD DAYS IN THE JUNGLE IF SHERE KHAN HAD MADE A FALSE STEP WITH HIS LAME PAW UP IN THE JUNGLES BY THE WAINGUNGA MOWGLI WOULD HAVE HEARD HIM IN THOSE LONG STILL MORNINGS AT LAST A DAY CAME WHEN HE DID NOT SEE GRAY BROTHER AT THE SIGNAL PLACE AND HE LAUGHED AND HEADED THE BUFFALOES FOR THE RAVINE BY THE DHK TREE WHICH WAS ALL COVERED WITH GOLDENRED FLOWERS THERE SAT GRAY BROTHER EVERY BRISTLE ON HIS BACK LIFTED HE HAS HIDDEN FOR A MONTH TO THROW THEE OFF THY GUARD HE CROSSED THE RANGES LAST NIGHT WITH TABAQUI HOTFOOT ON THY TRAIL SAID THE WOLF PANTING MOWGLI FROWNED I AM NOT AFRAID OF SHERE KHAN BUT TABAQUI IS VERY CUNNING HAVE NO FEAR SAID GRAY BROTHER LICKING HIS LIPS A LITTLE I MET TABAQUI IN THE DAWN NOW HE IS TELLING ALL HIS WISDOM TO THE KITES BUT HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING BEFORE I BROKE HIS BACK SHERE KHANS PLAN IS TO WAIT FOR THEE AT THE VILLAGE GATE THIS EVENINGFOR THEE AND FOR NO ONE ELSE HE IS LYING UP NOW IN THE BIG DRY RAVINE OF THE WAINGUNGA HAS HE EATEN TODAY OR DOES HE HUNT EMPTY SAID MOWGLI FOR THE ANSWER MEANT LIFE AND DEATH TO HIM HE KILLED AT DAWNA PIGAND HE HAS DRUNK TOO REMEMBER SHERE KHAN COULD NEVER FAST EVEN FOR THE SAKE OF REVENGE OH FOOL FOOL WHAT A CUBS CUB IT IS EATEN AND DRUNK TOO AND HE THINKS THAT I SHALL WAIT TILL HE HAS SLEPT NOW WHERE DOES HE LIE UP IF THERE WERE BUT TEN OF US WE MIGHT PULL HIM DOWN AS HE LIES THESE BUFFALOES WILL NOT CHARGE UNLESS THEY WIND HIM AND I CANNOT SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE CAN WE GET BEHIND HIS TRACK SO THAT THEY MAY SMELL IT HE SWAM FAR DOWN THE WAINGUNGA TO CUT THAT OFF SAID GRAY BROTHER TABAQUI TOLD HIM THAT I KNOW HE WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IT ALONE MOWGLI STOOD WITH HIS FINGER IN HIS MOUTH THINKING THE BIG RAVINE OF THE WAINGUNGA THAT OPENS OUT ON THE PLAIN NOT HALF A MILE FROM HERE I CAN TAKE THE HERD ROUND THROUGH THE JUNGLE TO THE HEAD OF THE RAVINE AND THEN SWEEP DOWNBUT HE WOULD SLINK OUT AT THE FOOT WE MUST BLOCK THAT END GRAY BROTHER CANST THOU CUT THE HERD IN TWO FOR ME NOT I PERHAPSBUT I HAVE BROUGHT A WISE HELPER GRAY BROTHER TROTTED OFF AND DROPPED INTO A HOLE THEN THERE LIFTED UP A HUGE GRAY HEAD THAT MOWGLI KNEW WELL AND THE HOT AIR WAS FILLED WITH THE MOST DESOLATE CRY OF ALL THE JUNGLETHE HUNTING HOWL OF A WOLF AT MIDDAY AKELA AKELA SAID MOWGLI CLAPPING HIS HANDS I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT THOU WOULDST NOT FORGET ME WE HAVE A BIG WORK IN HAND CUT THE HERD IN TWO AKELA KEEP THE COWS AND CALVES TOGETHER AND THE BULLS AND THE PLOW BUFFALOES BY THEMSELVES THE TWO WOLVES RAN LADIESCHAIN FASHION IN AND OUT OF THE HERD WHICH SNORTED AND THREW UP ITS HEAD AND SEPARATED INTO TWO CLUMPS IN ONE THE COWBUFFALOES STOOD WITH THEIR CALVES IN THE CENTER AND GLARED AND PAWED READY IF A WOLF WOULD ONLY STAY STILL TO CHARGE DOWN AND TRAMPLE THE LIFE OUT OF HIM IN THE OTHER THE BULLS AND THE YOUNG BULLS SNORTED AND STAMPED BUT THOUGH THEY LOOKED MORE IMPOSING THEY WERE MUCH LESS DANGEROUS FOR THEY HAD NO CALVES TO PROTECT NO SIX MEN COULD HAVE DIVIDED THE HERD SO NEATLY WHAT ORDERS PANTED AKELA THEY ARE TRYING TO JOIN AGAIN MOWGLI SLIPPED ON TO RAMAS BACK DRIVE THE BULLS AWAY TO THE LEFT AKELA GRAY BROTHER WHEN WE ARE GONE HOLD THE COWS TOGETHER AND DRIVE THEM INTO THE FOOT OF THE RAVINE HOW FAR SAID GRAY BROTHER PANTING AND SNAPPING TILL THE SIDES ARE HIGHER THAN SHERE KHAN CAN JUMP SHOUTED MOWGLI KEEP THEM THERE TILL WE COME DOWN THE BULLS SWEPT OFF AS AKELA BAYED AND GRAY BROTHER STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE COWS THEY CHARGED DOWN ON HIM AND HE RAN JUST BEFORE THEM TO THE FOOT OF THE RAVINE AS AKELA DROVE THE BULLS FAR TO THE LEFT WELL DONE ANOTHER CHARGE AND THEY ARE FAIRLY STARTED CAREFUL NOWCAREFUL AKELA A SNAP TOO MUCH AND THE BULLS WILL CHARGE HUJAH THIS IS WILDER WORK THAN DRIVING BLACKBUCK DIDST THOU THINK THESE CREATURES COULD MOVE SO SWIFTLY MOWGLI CALLED I HAVEHAVE HUNTED THESE TOO IN MY TIME GASPED AKELA IN THE DUST SHALL I TURN THEM INTO THE JUNGLE AY TURN SWIFTLY TURN THEM RAMA IS MAD WITH RAGE OH IF I COULD ONLY TELL HIM WHAT I NEED OF HIM TODAY THE BULLS WERE TURNED TO THE RIGHT THIS TIME AND CRASHED INTO THE STANDING THICKET THE OTHER HERD CHILDREN WATCHING WITH THE CATTLE HALF A MILE AWAY HURRIED TO THE VILLAGE AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM CRYING THAT THE BUFFALOES HAD GONE MAD AND RUN AWAY BUT MOWGLIS PLAN WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS TO MAKE A BIG CIRCLE UPHILL AND GET AT THE HEAD OF THE RAVINE AND THEN TAKE THE BULLS DOWN IT AND CATCH SHERE KHAN BETWEEN THE BULLS AND THE COWS FOR HE KNEW THAT AFTER A MEAL AND A FULL DRINK SHERE KHAN WOULD NOT BE IN ANY CONDITION TO FIGHT OR TO CLAMBER UP THE SIDES OF THE RAVINE HE WAS SOOTHING THE BUFFALOES NOW BY VOICE AND AKELA HAD DROPPED FAR TO THE REAR ONLY WHIMPERING ONCE OR TWICE TO HURRY THE REARGUARD IT WAS A LONG LONG CIRCLE FOR THEY DID NOT WISH TO GET TOO NEAR THE RAVINE AND GIVE SHERE KHAN WARNING AT LAST MOWGLI ROUNDED UP THE BEWILDERED HERD AT THE HEAD OF THE RAVINE ON A GRASSY PATCH THAT SLOPED STEEPLY DOWN TO THE RAVINE ITSELF FROM THAT HEIGHT YOU COULD SEE ACROSS THE TOPS OF THE TREES DOWN TO THE PLAIN BELOW BUT WHAT MOWGLI LOOKED AT WAS THE SIDES OF THE RAVINE AND HE SAW WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SATISFACTION THAT THEY RAN NEARLY STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN WHILE THE VINES AND CREEPERS THAT HUNG OVER THEM WOULD GIVE NO FOOTHOLD TO A TIGER WHO WANTED TO GET OUT LET THEM BREATHE AKELA HE SAID HOLDING UP HIS HAND THEY HAVE NOT WINDED HIM YET LET THEM BREATHE I MUST TELL SHERE KHAN WHO COMES WE HAVE HIM IN THE TRAP HE PUT HIS HANDS TO HIS MOUTH AND SHOUTED DOWN THE RAVINEIT WAS ALMOST LIKE SHOUTING DOWN A TUNNELAND THE ECHOES JUMPED FROM ROCK TO ROCK AFTER A LONG TIME THERE CAME BACK THE DRAWLING SLEEPY SNARL OF A FULLFED TIGER JUST WAKENED WHO CALLS SAID SHERE KHAN AND A SPLENDID PEACOCK FLUTTERED UP OUT OF THE RAVINE SCREECHING I MOWGLI CATTLE THIEF IT IS TIME TO COME TO THE COUNCIL ROCK DOWNHURRY THEM DOWN AKELA DOWN RAMA DOWN THE HERD PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT AT THE EDGE OF THE SLOPE BUT AKELA GAVE TONGUE IN THE FULL HUNTINGYELL AND THEY PITCHED OVER ONE AFTER THE OTHER JUST AS STEAMERS SHOOT RAPIDS THE SAND AND STONES SPURTING UP ROUND THEM ONCE STARTED THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF STOPPING AND BEFORE THEY WERE FAIRLY IN THE BED OF THE RAVINE RAMA WINDED SHERE KHAN AND BELLOWED HA HA SAID MOWGLI ON HIS BACK NOW THOU KNOWEST AND THE TORRENT OF BLACK HORNS FOAMING MUZZLES AND STARING EYES WHIRLED DOWN THE RAVINE JUST AS BOULDERS GO DOWN IN FLOODTIME THE WEAKER BUFFALOES BEING SHOULDERED OUT TO THE SIDES OF THE RAVINE WHERE THEY TORE THROUGH THE CREEPERS THEY KNEW WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS BEFORE THEMTHE TERRIBLE CHARGE OF THE BUFFALO HERD AGAINST WHICH NO TIGER CAN HOPE TO STAND SHERE KHAN HEARD THE THUNDER OF THEIR HOOFS PICKED HIMSELF UP AND LUMBERED DOWN THE RAVINE LOOKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR SOME WAY OF ESCAPE BUT THE WALLS OF THE RAVINE WERE STRAIGHT AND HE HAD TO HOLD ON HEAVY WITH HIS DINNER AND HIS DRINK WILLING TO DO ANYTHING RATHER THAN FIGHT THE HERD SPLASHED THROUGH THE POOL HE HAD JUST LEFT BELLOWING TILL THE NARROW CUT RANG MOWGLI HEARD AN ANSWERING BELLOW FROM THE FOOT OF THE RAVINE SAW SHERE KHAN TURN THE TIGER KNEW IF THE WORST CAME TO THE WORST IT WAS BETTER TO MEET THE BULLS THAN THE COWS WITH THEIR CALVES AND THEN RAMA TRIPPED STUMBLED AND WENT ON AGAIN OVER SOMETHING SOFT AND WITH THE BULLS AT HIS HEELS CRASHED FULL INTO THE OTHER HERD WHILE THE WEAKER BUFFALOES WERE LIFTED CLEAN OFF THEIR FEET BY THE SHOCK OF THE MEETING THAT CHARGE CARRIED BOTH HERDS OUT INTO THE PLAIN GORING AND STAMPING AND SNORTING MOWGLI WATCHED HIS TIME AND SLIPPED OFF RAMAS NECK LAYING ABOUT HIM RIGHT AND LEFT WITH HIS STICK QUICK AKELA BREAK THEM UP SCATTER THEM OR THEY WILL BE FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER DRIVE THEM AWAY AKELA HAI RAMA HAI HAI HAI MY CHILDREN SOFTLY NOW SOFTLY IT IS ALL OVER AKELA AND GRAY BROTHER RAN TO AND FRO NIPPING THE BUFFALOES LEGS AND THOUGH THE HERD WHEELED ONCE TO

BILLOW THEN SOFT BE THY PILLOW AH WEARY WEE FLIPPERLING CURL AT THY EASE THE STORM SHALL NOT WAKE THEE NOR SHARK OVERTAKE THEE ASLEEP IN THE ARMS OF THE SLOWSWINGING SEAS SEAL LULLABY ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AT A PLACE CALLED NOVASTOSHNAH OR NORTH EAST POINT ON THE ISLAND OF ST PAUL AWAY AND AWAY IN THE BERING SEA LIMMERSHIN THE WINTER WREN TOLD ME THE TALE WHEN HE WAS BLOWN ON TO THE RIGGING OF A STEAMER GOING TO JAPAN AND I TOOK HIM DOWN INTO MY CABIN AND WARMED AND FED HIM FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS TILL HE WAS FIT TO FLY BACK TO ST PAULS AGAIN LIMMERSHIN IS A VERY QUAINT LITTLE BIRD BUT HE KNOWS HOW TO TELL THE TRUTH NOBODY COMES TO NOVASTOSHNAH EXCEPT ON BUSINESS AND THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE REGULAR BUSINESS THERE ARE THE SEALS THEY COME IN THE SUMMER MONTHS BY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OUT OF THE COLD GRAY SEA FOR NOVASTOSHNAH BEACH HAS THE FINEST ACCOMMODATION FOR SEALS OF ANY PLACE IN ALL THE WORLD SEA CATCH KNEW THAT AND EVERY SPRING WOULD SWIM FROM WHATEVER PLACE HE HAPPENED TO BE INWOULD SWIM LIKE A TORPEDOBOAT STRAIGHT FOR NOVASTOSHNAH AND SPEND A MONTH FIGHTING WITH HIS COMPANIONS FOR A GOOD PLACE ON THE ROCKS AS CLOSE TO THE SEA AS POSSIBLE SEA CATCH WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD A HUGE GRAY FUR SEAL WITH ALMOST A MANE ON HIS SHOULDERS AND LONG WICKED DOG TEETH WHEN HE HEAVED HIMSELF UP ON HIS FRONT FLIPPERS HE STOOD MORE THAN FOUR FEET CLEAR OF THE GROUND AND HIS WEIGHT IF ANYONE HAD BEEN BOLD ENOUGH TO WEIGH HIM WAS NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS HE WAS SCARRED ALL OVER WITH THE MARKS OF SAVAGE FIGHTS BUT HE WAS ALWAYS READY FOR JUST ONE FIGHT MORE HE WOULD PUT HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AS THOUGH HE WERE AFRAID TO LOOK HIS ENEMY IN THE FACE THEN HE WOULD SHOOT IT OUT LIKE LIGHTNING AND WHEN THE BIG TEETH WERE FIRMLY FIXED ON THE OTHER SEALS NECK THE OTHER SEAL MIGHT GET AWAY IF HE COULD BUT SEA CATCH WOULD NOT HELP HIM YET SEA CATCH NEVER CHASED A BEATEN SEAL FOR THAT WAS AGAINST THE RULES OF THE BEACH HE ONLY WANTED ROOM BY THE SEA FOR HIS NURSERY BUT AS THERE WERE FORTY OR FIFTY THOUSAND OTHER SEALS HUNTING FOR THE SAME THING EACH SPRING THE WHISTLING BELLOWING ROARING AND BLOWING ON THE BEACH WAS SOMETHING FRIGHTFUL FROM A LITTLE HILL CALLED HUTCHINSONS HILL YOU COULD LOOK OVER THREE AND A HALF MILES OF GROUND COVERED WITH FIGHTING SEALS AND THE SURF WAS DOTTED ALL OVER WITH THE HEADS OF SEALS HURRYING TO LAND AND BEGIN THEIR SHARE OF THE FIGHTING THEY FOUGHT IN THE BREAKERS THEY FOUGHT IN THE SAND AND THEY FOUGHT ON THE SMOOTHWORN BASALT ROCKS OF THE NURSERIES FOR THEY WERE JUST AS STUPID AND UNACCOMMODATING AS MEN THEIR WIVES NEVER CAME TO THE ISLAND UNTIL LATE IN MAY OR EARLY IN JUNE FOR THEY DID NOT CARE TO BE TORN TO PIECES AND THE YOUNG TWO THREE AND FOURYEAROLD SEALS WHO HAD NOT BEGUN HOUSEKEEPING WENT INLAND ABOUT HALF A MILE THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE FIGHTERS AND PLAYED ABOUT ON THE SAND DUNES IN DROVES AND LEGIONS AND RUBBED OFF EVERY SINGLE GREEN THING THAT GREW THEY WERE CALLED THE HOLLUSCHICKIETHE BACHELORSAND THERE WERE PERHAPS TWO OR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM AT NOVASTOSHNAH ALONE SEA CATCH HAD JUST FINISHED HIS FORTYFIFTH FIGHT ONE SPRING WHEN MATKAH HIS SOFT SLEEK GENTLEEYED WIFE CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA AND HE CAUGHT HER BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK AND DUMPED HER DOWN ON HIS RESERVATION SAYING GRUFFLY LATE AS USUAL WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN IT WAS NOT THE FASHION FOR SEA CATCH TO EAT ANYTHING DURING THE FOUR MONTHS HE STAYED ON THE BEACHES AND SO HIS TEMPER WAS GENERALLY BAD MATKAH KNEW BETTER THAN TO ANSWER BACK SHE LOOKED ROUND AND COOED HOW THOUGHTFUL OF YOU YOUVE TAKEN THE OLD PLACE AGAIN I SHOULD THINK I HAD SAID SEA CATCH LOOK AT ME HE WAS SCRATCHED AND BLEEDING IN TWENTY PLACES ONE EYE WAS ALMOST OUT AND HIS SIDES WERE TORN TO RIBBONS OH YOU MEN YOU MEN MATKAH SAID FANNING HERSELF WITH HER HIND FLIPPER WHY CANT YOU BE SENSIBLE AND SETTLE YOUR PLACES QUIETLY YOU LOOK AS THOUGH YOU HAD BEEN FIGHTING WITH THE KILLER WHALE I HAVENT BEEN DOING ANYTHING BUT FIGHT SINCE THE MIDDLE OF MAY THE BEACH IS DISGRACEFULLY CROWDED THIS SEASON IVE MET AT LEAST A HUNDRED SEALS FROM LUKANNON BEACH HOUSE HUNTING WHY CANT PEOPLE STAY WHERE THEY BELONG IVE OFTEN THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE MUCH HAPPIER IF WE HAULED OUT AT OTTER ISLAND INSTEAD OF THIS CROWDED PLACE SAID MATKAH BAH ONLY THE HOLLUSCHICKIE GO TO OTTER ISLAND IF WE WENT THERE THEY WOULD SAY WE WERE AFRAID WE MUST PRESERVE APPEARANCES MY DEAR SEA CATCH SUNK HIS HEAD PROUDLY BETWEEN HIS FAT SHOULDERS AND PRETENDED TO GO TO SLEEP FOR A FEW MINUTES BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS KEEPING A SHARP LOOKOUT FOR A FIGHT NOW THAT ALL THE SEALS AND THEIR WIVES WERE ON THE LAND YOU COULD HEAR THEIR CLAMOR MILES OUT TO SEA ABOVE THE LOUDEST GALES AT THE LOWEST COUNTING THERE WERE OVER A MILLION SEALS ON THE BEACHOLD SEALS MOTHER SEALS TINY BABIES AND HOLLUSCHICKIE FIGHTING SCUFFLING BLEATING CRAWLING AND PLAYING TOGETHERGOING DOWN TO THE SEA AND COMING UP FROM IT IN GANGS AND REGIMENTS LYING OVER EVERY FOOT OF GROUND AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH AND SKIRMISHING ABOUT IN BRIGADES THROUGH THE FOG IT IS NEARLY ALWAYS FOGGY AT NOVASTOSHNAH EXCEPT WHEN THE SUN COMES OUT AND MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK ALL PEARLY AND RAINBOWCOLORED FOR A LITTLE WHILE KOTICK MATKAHS BABY WAS BORN IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT CONFUSION AND HE WAS ALL HEAD AND SHOULDERS WITH PALE WATERY BLUE EYES AS TINY SEALS MUST BE BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIS COAT THAT MADE HIS MOTHER LOOK AT HIM VERY CLOSELY SEA CATCH SHE SAID AT LAST OUR BABYS GOING TO BE WHITE EMPTY CLAMSHELLS AND DRY SEAWEED SNORTED SEA CATCH THERE NEVER HAS BEEN SUCH A THING IN THE WORLD AS A WHITE SEAL I CANT HELP THAT SAID MATKAH THERES GOING TO BE NOW AND SHE SANG THE LOW CROONING SEAL SONG THAT ALL THE MOTHER SEALS SING TO THEIR BABIES YOU MUSTNT SWIM TILL YOURE SIX WEEKS OLD OR YOUR HEAD WILL BE SUNK BY YOUR HEELS AND SUMMER GALES AND KILLER WHALES ARE BAD FOR BABY SEALS ARE BAD FOR BABY SEALS DEAR RAT AS BAD AS BAD CAN BE BUT SPLASH AND GROW STRONG AND YOU CANT BE WRONG CHILD OF THE OPEN SEA OF COURSE THE LITTLE FELLOW DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORDS AT FIRST HE PADDLED AND SCRAMBLED ABOUT BY HIS MOTHERS SIDE AND LEARNED TO SCUFFLE OUT OF THE WAY WHEN HIS FATHER WAS FIGHTING WITH ANOTHER SEAL AND THE TWO ROLLED AND ROARED UP AND DOWN THE SLIPPERY ROCKS MATKAH USED TO GO TO SEA TO GET THINGS TO EAT AND THE BABY WAS FED ONLY ONCE IN TWO DAYS BUT THEN HE ATE ALL HE COULD AND THROVE UPON IT THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO CRAWL INLAND AND THERE HE MET TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BABIES OF HIS OWN AGE AND THEY PLAYED TOGETHER LIKE PUPPIES WENT TO SLEEP ON THE CLEAN SAND AND PLAYED AGAIN THE OLD PEOPLE IN THE NURSERIES TOOK NO NOTICE OF THEM AND THE HOLLUSCHICKIE KEPT TO THEIR OWN GROUNDS AND THE BABIES HAD A BEAUTIFUL PLAYTIME WHEN MATKAH CAME BACK FROM HER DEEPSEA FISHING SHE WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THEIR PLAYGROUND AND CALL AS A SHEEP CALLS FOR A LAMB AND WAIT UNTIL SHE HEARD KOTICK BLEAT THEN SHE WOULD TAKE THE STRAIGHTEST OF STRAIGHT LINES IN HIS DIRECTION STRIKING OUT WITH HER FORE FLIPPERS AND KNOCKING THE YOUNGSTERS HEAD OVER HEELS RIGHT AND LEFT THERE WERE ALWAYS A FEW HUNDRED MOTHERS HUNTING FOR THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH THE PLAYGROUNDS AND THE BABIES WERE KEPT LIVELY BUT AS MATKAH TOLD KOTICK SO LONG AS YOU DONT LIE IN MUDDY WATER AND GET MANGE OR RUB THE HARD SAND INTO A CUT OR SCRATCH AND SO LONG AS YOU NEVER GO SWIMMING WHEN THERE IS A HEAVY SEA NOTHING WILL HURT YOU HERE LITTLE SEALS CAN NO MORE SWIM THAN LITTLE CHILDREN BUT THEY ARE UNHAPPY TILL THEY LEARN THE FIRST TIME THAT KOTICK WENT DOWN TO THE SEA A WAVE CARRIED HIM OUT BEYOND HIS DEPTH AND HIS BIG HEAD SANK AND HIS LITTLE HIND FLIPPERS FLEW UP EXACTLY AS HIS MOTHER HAD TOLD HIM IN THE SONG AND IF THE NEXT WAVE HAD NOT THROWN HIM BACK AGAIN HE WOULD HAVE DROWNED AFTER THAT HE LEARNED TO LIE IN A BEACH POOL AND LET THE WASH OF THE WAVES JUST COVER HIM AND LIFT HIM UP WHILE HE PADDLED BUT HE ALWAYS KEPT HIS EYE OPEN FOR BIG WAVES THAT MIGHT HURT HE WAS TWO WEEKS LEARNING TO USE HIS FLIPPERS AND ALL THAT WHILE HE FLOUNDERED IN AND OUT OF THE WATER AND COUGHED AND GRUNTED AND CRAWLED UP THE BEACH AND TOOK CATNAPS ON THE SAND AND WENT BACK AGAIN UNTIL AT LAST HE FOUND THAT HE TRULY BELONGED TO THE WATER THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TIMES THAT HE HAD WITH HIS COMPANIONS DUCKING UNDER THE ROLLERS OR COMING IN ON TOP OF A COMBER AND LANDING WITH A SWASH AND A SPLUTTER AS THE BIG WAVE WENT WHIRLING FAR UP THE BEACH OR STANDING UP ON HIS TAIL AND SCRATCHING HIS HEAD AS THE OLD PEOPLE DID OR PLAYING IM THE KING OF THE CASTLE ON SLIPPERY WEEDY ROCKS THAT JUST STUCK OUT OF THE WASH NOW AND THEN HE WOULD SEE A THIN FIN LIKE A BIG SHARKS FIN DRIFTING ALONG CLOSE TO SHORE AND HE KNEW THAT THAT WAS THE KILLER WHALE THE GRAMPUS WHO EATS YOUNG SEALS WHEN HE CAN GET THEM AND KOTICK WOULD HEAD FOR THE BEACH LIKE AN ARROW AND THE FIN WOULD JIG OFF SLOWLY AS IF IT WERE LOOKING FOR NOTHING AT ALL LATE IN OCTOBER THE SEALS BEGAN TO LEAVE ST PAULS FOR THE DEEP SEA BY FAMILIES AND TRIBES AND THERE WAS NO MORE FIGHTING OVER THE NURSERIES AND THE HOLLUSCHICKIE PLAYED ANYWHERE THEY LIKED NEXT YEAR SAID MATKAH TO KOTICK YOU WILL BE A HOLLUSCHICKIE BUT THIS YEAR YOU MUST LEARN HOW TO CATCH FISH THEY SET OUT TOGETHER ACROSS THE PACIFIC AND MATKAH SHOWED KOTICK HOW TO SLEEP ON HIS BACK WITH HIS FLIPPERS TUCKED DOWN BY HIS SIDE AND HIS LITTLE NOSE JUST OUT OF THE WATER NO CRADLE IS SO COMFORTABLE AS THE LONG ROCKING SWELL OF THE PACIFIC WHEN KOTICK FELT HIS SKIN TINGLE ALL OVER MATKAH TOLD HIM HE WAS LEARNING THE FEEL OF THE WATER AND THAT TINGLY PRICKLY FEELINGS MEANT BAD WEATHER COMING AND HE MUST SWIM HARD AND GET AWAY IN A LITTLE TIME SHE SAID YOULL KNOW WHERE TO SWIM TO BUT JUST NOW WELL FOLLOW SEA PIG THE PORPOISE FOR HE IS VERY WISE A SCHOOL OF PORPOISES WERE DUCKING AND TEARING THROUGH THE WATER AND LITTLE KOTICK FOLLOWED THEM AS FAST AS HE COULD HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO TO HE PANTED THE LEADER OF THE SCHOOL ROLLED HIS WHITE EYE AND DUCKED UNDER MY TAIL TINGLES YOUNGSTER HE SAID THAT MEANS THERES A GALE BEHIND ME COME ALONG WHEN YOURE SOUTH OF THE STICKY WATER HE MEANT THE EQUATOR AND YOUR TAIL TINGLES THAT MEANS THERES A GALE IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU MUST HEAD NORTH COME ALONG THE WATER FEELS BAD HERE THIS WAS ONE OF VERY MANY THINGS THAT KOTICK LEARNED AND HE WAS ALWAYS LEARNING MATKAH TAUGHT HIM TO FOLLOW THE COD AND THE HALIBUT ALONG THE UNDERSEA BANKS AND WRENCH THE ROCKLING OUT OF HIS HOLE AMONG THE WEEDS HOW TO SKIRT THE WRECKS LYING A HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW WATER AND DART LIKE A RIFLE BULLET IN AT ONE PORTHOLE AND OUT AT ANOTHER AS THE FISHES RAN HOW TO DANCE ON THE TOP OF THE WAVES WHEN THE LIGHTNING WAS RACING ALL OVER THE SKY AND WAVE HIS FLIPPER POLITELY TO THE STUMPYTAILED ALBATROSS AND THE MANOFWAR HAWK AS THEY WENT DOWN THE WIND HOW TO JUMP THREE OR FOUR FEET CLEAR OF THE WATER LIKE A DOLPHIN FLIPPERS CLOSE TO THE SIDE AND TAIL CURVED TO LEAVE THE FLYING FISH ALONE BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL BONY TO TAKE THE SHOULDERPIECE OUT OF A COD AT FULL SPEED TEN FATHOMS DEEP AND NEVER TO STOP AND LOOK AT A BOAT OR A SHIP BUT PARTICULARLY A ROWBOAT AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS WHAT KOTICK DID NOT KNOW ABOUT DEEPSEA FISHING WAS NOT WORTH THE KNOWING AND ALL THAT TIME HE NEVER SET FLIPPER ON DRY GROUND ONE DAY HOWEVER AS HE WAS LYING HALF ASLEEP IN THE WARM WATER SOMEWHERE OFF THE ISLAND OF JUAN FERNANDEZ HE FELT FAINT AND LAZY ALL OVER JUST AS HUMAN PEOPLE DO WHEN THE SPRING IS IN THEIR LEGS AND HE REMEMBERED THE GOOD FIRM BEACHES OF NOVASTOSHNAH SEVEN THOUSAND MILES AWAY THE GAMES HIS COMPANIONS PLAYED THE SMELL OF THE SEAWEED THE SEAL ROAR AND THE FIGHTING THAT VERY MINUTE HE TURNED NORTH SWIMMING STEADILY AND AS HE WENT ON HE MET SCORES OF HIS MATES ALL BOUND FOR THE SAME PLACE AND THEY SAID GREETING KOTICK THIS YEAR WE ARE ALL HOLLUSCHICKIE AND WE CAN DANCE THE FIREDANCE IN THE BREAKERS OFF LUKANNON AND PLAY ON THE NEW GRASS BUT WHERE DID YOU GET THAT COAT KOTICKS FUR WAS ALMOST PURE WHITE NOW AND THOUGH HE FELT VERY PROUD OF IT HE ONLY SAID SWIM QUICKLY MY BONES ARE ACHING FOR THE LAND AND SO THEY ALL CAME TO THE BEACHES WHERE THEY HAD BEEN BORN AND HEARD THE OLD SEALS THEIR FATHERS FIGHTING IN THE ROLLING MIST THAT NIGHT KOTICK DANCED THE FIREDANCE WITH THE YEARLING SEALS THE SEA IS FULL OF FIRE ON SUMMER NIGHTS ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM NOVASTOSHNAH TO LUKANNON AND EACH SEAL LEAVES A WAKE LIKE BURNING OIL BEHIND HIM AND A FLAMING FLASH WHEN HE JUMPS AND THE WAVES BREAK IN GREAT PHOSPHORESCENT STREAKS AND SWIRLS THEN THEY WENT INLAND TO THE HOLLUSCHICKIE GROUNDS AND ROLLED UP AND DOWN IN THE NEW WILD WHEAT AND TOLD STORIES OF WHAT THEY HAD DONE WHILE THEY HAD BEEN AT SEA THEY TALKED ABOUT THE PACIFIC AS BOYS WOULD TALK ABOUT A WOOD THAT THEY HAD BEEN NUTTING IN AND IF ANYONE HAD UNDERSTOOD THEM HE COULD HAVE GONE AWAY AND MADE SUCH A CHART OF THAT OCEAN AS NEVER WAS THE THREE AND FOURYEAROLD HOLLUSCHICKIE ROMPED DOWN FROM HUTCHINSONS HILL CRYING OUT OF THE WAY YOUNGSTERS THE SEA IS DEEP AND YOU DONT KNOW ALL THATS IN IT YET WAIT TILL YOUVE ROUNDED THE HORN HI YOU YEARLING WHERE DID YOU GET THAT WHITE COAT I DIDNT GET IT SAID KOTICK IT GREW AND JUST AS HE WAS GOING TO ROLL THE SPEAKER OVER A COUPLE OF BLACKHAIRED MEN WITH FLAT RED FACES CAME FROM BEHIND A SAND DUNE AND KOTICK WHO HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN BEFORE COUGHED AND LOWERED HIS HEAD THE HOLLUSCHICKIE JUST BUNDLED OFF A FEW YARDS AND SAT STARING STUPIDLY THE MEN WERE NO LESS THAN KERICK BOOTERIN THE CHIEF OF THE SEALHUNTERS ON THE ISLAND AND PATALAMON HIS SON THEY CAME FROM THE LITTLE VILLAGE NOT HALF A MILE FROM THE SEA NURSERIES AND THEY WERE DECIDING WHAT SEALS THEY WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE KILLING PENSFOR THE SEALS WERE DRIVEN JUST LIKE SHEEPTO BE TURNED INTO SEALSKIN JACKETS LATER ON HO SAID PATALAMON LOOK THERES A WHITE SEAL KERICK BOOTERIN TURNED NEARLY WHITE UNDER HIS OIL AND SMOKE FOR HE WAS AN ALEUT AND ALEUTS ARE NOT CLEAN PEOPLE THEN HE BEGAN TO MUTTER A PRAYER DONT TOUCH HIM PATALAMON THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A WHITE SEAL SINCESINCE I WAS BORN PERHAPS IT IS OLD ZAHARROFS GHOST HE WAS LOST LAST YEAR IN THE BIG GALE IM NOT GOING NEAR HIM SAID PATALAMON HES UNLUCKY DO YOU REALLY THINK HE IS OLD ZAHARROF COME BACK I OWE HIM FOR SOME GULLS EGGS DONT LOOK AT HIM SAID KERICK HEAD OFF THAT DROVE OF FOURYEAROLDS THE MEN OUGHT TO SKIN TWO HUNDRED TODAY BUT ITS THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON AND THEY ARE NEW TO THE WORK A HUNDRED WILL DO QUICK PATALAMON RATTLED A PAIR OF SEALS SHOULDER BONES IN FRONT OF A HERD OF HOLLUSCHICKIE AND THEY STOPPED DEAD PUFFING AND BLOWING THEN HE STEPPED NEAR AND THE SEALS BEGAN TO MOVE AND KERICK HEADED THEM INLAND AND THEY NEVER TRIED TO GET BACK TO THEIR COMPANIONS HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SEALS WATCHED THEM BEING DRIVEN BUT THEY WENT ON PLAYING JUST THE SAME KOTICK WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO ASKED QUESTIONS AND NONE OF HIS COMPANIONS COULD TELL HIM ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT THE MEN ALWAYS DROVE SEALS IN THAT WAY FOR SIX WEEKS OR TWO MONTHS OF EVERY YEAR I AM GOING TO FOLLOW HE SAID AND HIS EYES NEARLY POPPED OUT OF HIS HEAD AS HE SHUFFLED ALONG IN THE WAKE OF THE HERD THE WHITE SEAL IS COMING AFTER US CRIED PATALAMON THATS THE FIRST TIME A SEAL HAS EVER COME TO THE KILLINGGROUNDS ALONE HSH DONT LOOK BEHIND YOU SAID KERICK IT IS ZAHARROFS GHOST I MUST SPEAK TO THE PRIEST ABOUT THIS THE DISTANCE TO THE KILLINGGROUNDS WAS ONLY HALF A MILE BUT IT TOOK AN HOUR TO COVER BECAUSE IF THE SEALS WENT TOO FAST KERICK KNEW THAT THEY WOULD GET HEATED AND THEN THEIR FUR WOULD COME OFF IN PATCHES WHEN THEY WERE SKINNED SO THEY WENT ON VERY SLOWLY PAST SEA LIONS NECK PAST WEBSTER HOUSE TILL THEY CAME TO THE SALT HOUSE JUST BEYOND THE SIGHT OF THE SEALS ON THE BEACH KOTICK FOLLOWED PANTING AND WONDERING HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS AT THE WORLDS END BUT THE ROAR OF THE SEAL NURSERIES BEHIND HIM SOUNDED AS LOUD AS THE ROAR OF A TRAIN IN A TUNNEL THEN KERICK SAT DOWN ON THE MOSS AND PULLED OUT A HEAVY PEWTER WATCH AND LET THE DROVE COOL OFF FOR THIRTY MINUTES AND KOTICK COULD HEAR THE FOGDEW DRIPPING OFF THE BRIM OF HIS CAP THEN TEN OR TWELVE MEN EACH WITH AN IRONBOUND CLUB THREE OR FOUR FEET LONG CAME UP AND KERICK POINTED OUT ONE OR TWO OF THE DROVE THAT WERE BITTEN BY THEIR COMPANIONS OR TOO HOT AND THE MEN KICKED THOSE ASIDE WITH THEIR HEAVY BOOTS MADE OF THE SKIN OF A WALRUSS THROAT AND THEN KERICK SAID LET GO AND THEN THE MEN CLUBBED THE SEALS ON THE HEAD AS FAST AS THEY COULD TEN MINUTES LATER LITTLE KOTICK DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIS FRIENDS ANY MORE FOR THEIR SKINS WERE RIPPED OFF FROM THE NOSE TO THE HIND FLIPPERS WHIPPED OFF AND THROWN DOWN ON THE GROUND IN A PILE THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR KOTICK HE TURNED AND GALLOPED A SEAL CAN GALLOP VERY SWIFTLY FOR A SHORT TIME BACK TO THE SEA HIS LITTLE NEW MUSTACHE BRISTLING WITH HORROR AT SEA LIONS NECK WHERE THE GREAT SEA LIONS SIT ON THE EDGE OF THE SURF HE FLUNG HIMSELF FLIPPEROVERHEAD INTO THE COOL WATER AND ROCKED THERE GASPING MISERABLY WHATS HERE SAID A SEA LION GRUFFLY FOR AS A RULE THE SEA LIONS KEEP THEMSELVES TO THEMSELVES SCOOCHNIE OCHEN SCOOCHNIE IM LONESOME VERY LONESOME SAID KOTICK THEYRE KILLING ALL THE HOLLUSCHICKIE ON ALL THE BEACHES THE SEA LION TURNED HIS HEAD INSHORE NONSENSE HE SAID YOUR FRIENDS ARE MAKING AS MUCH NOISE AS EVER YOU MUST HAVE SEEN OLD KERICK POLISHING OFF A DROVE HES DONE THAT FOR THIRTY YEARS ITS HORRIBLE SAID KOTICK BACKING WATER AS A WAVE WENT OVER HIM AND STEADYING HIMSELF WITH A SCREW STROKE OF HIS FLIPPERS THAT BROUGHT HIM ALL STANDING WITHIN THREE INCHES OF A JAGGED EDGE OF ROCK WELL DONE FOR A YEARLING SAID THE SEA LION WHO COULD APPRECIATE GOOD SWIMMING I SUPPOSE IT IS RATHER AWFUL FROM YOUR WAY OF LOOKING AT IT BUT IF YOU SEALS WILL COME HERE YEAR AFTER YEAR OF COURSE THE MEN GET TO KNOW OF IT AND UNLESS YOU CAN FIND AN ISLAND WHERE NO MEN EVER COME YOU WILL ALWAYS BE DRIVEN ISNT THERE ANY SUCH ISLAND BEGAN KOTICK IVE FOLLOWED THE POLTOOS THE HALIBUT FOR TWENTY YEARS AND I CANT SAY IVE FOUND IT YET BUT LOOK HEREYOU SEEM TO HAVE A FONDNESS FOR TALKING TO YOUR BETTERSSUPPOSE YOU GO TO WALRUS ISLET AND TALK TO SEA VITCH HE MAY KNOW SOMETHING DONT FLOUNCE OFF LIKE THAT ITS A SIXMILE SWIM AND IF I WERE YOU I SHOULD HAUL OUT AND TAKE A NAP FIRST LITTLE ONE KOTICK THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS GOOD ADVICE SO HE SWAM ROUND TO HIS OWN BEACH HAULED OUT AND SLEPT FOR HALF AN HOUR TWITCHING ALL OVER AS SEALS WILL THEN HE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR WALRUS ISLET A LITTLE LOW SHEET OF ROCKY ISLAND ALMOST DUE NORTHEAST FROM NOVASTOSHNAH ALL LEDGES AND ROCK AND GULLS NESTS WHERE THE WALRUS HERDED BY THEMSELVES HE LANDED CLOSE TO OLD SEA VITCHTHE BIG UGLY BLOATED PIMPLED FATNECKED LONGTUSKED WALRUS OF THE NORTH PACIFIC WHO HAS NO MANNERS EXCEPT WHEN HE IS ASLEEPAS HE WAS THEN WITH HIS HIND FLIPPERS HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF THE SURF WAKE UP BARKED KOTICK FOR THE GULLS WERE MAKING A GREAT NOISE HAH HO HMPH WHATS THAT SAID SEA VITCH AND HE STRUCK THE NEXT WALRUS A BLOW WITH HIS TUSKS AND WAKED HIM UP AND THE NEXT STRUCK THE NEXT AND SO ON TILL THEY WERE ALL AWAKE AND STARING IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT THE RIGHT ONE HI ITS ME SAID KOTICK BOBBING IN THE SURF AND LOOKING LIKE A LITTLE WHITE SLUG WELL MAY I BESKINNED SAID SEA VITCH AND THEY ALL LOOKED AT KOTICK AS YOU CAN FANCY A CLUB FULL OF DROWSY OLD GENTLEMEN WOULD LOOK AT A LITTLE BOY KOTICK DID NOT CARE TO HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT SKINNING JUST THEN HE HAD SEEN ENOUGH OF IT SO HE CALLED OUT ISNT THERE ANY PLACE FOR SEALS TO GO WHERE MEN DONT EVER COME GO AND FIND OUT SAID SEA VITCH SHUTTING HIS EYES RUN AWAY WERE BUSY HERE KOTICK MADE HIS DOLPHINJUMP IN THE AIR AND SHOUTED AS LOUD AS HE COULD CLAMEATER CLAMEATER HE KNEW THAT SEA VITCH NEVER CAUGHT A FISH IN HIS LIFE BUT ALWAYS ROOTED FOR CLAMS AND SEAWEED THOUGH HE PRETENDED TO BE A VERY TERRIBLE PERSON NATURALLY THE CHICKIES AND THE GOOVEROOSKIES AND THE EPATKASTHE BURGOMASTER GULLS AND THE KITTIWAKES AND THE PUFFINS WHO ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A CHANCE TO BE RUDE TOOK UP THE CRY ANDSO LIMMERSHIN TOLD MEFOR NEARLY FIVE MINUTES YOU COULD NOT HAVE HEARD A GUN FIRED ON WALRUS ISLET ALL THE POPULATION WAS YELLING AND SCREAMING CLAMEATER STAREEK OLD MAN WHILE SEA VITCH ROLLED FROM SIDE TO SIDE GRUNTING AND COUGHING NOW WILL YOU TELL SAID KOTICK ALL OUT OF BREATH GO AND ASK SEA COW SAID SEA VITCH IF HE IS LIVING STILL HELL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU HOW SHALL I KNOW SEA COW WHEN I MEET HIM SAID KOTICK SHEERING OFF HES THE ONLY THING IN THE SEA UGLIER THAN SEA VITCH SCREAMED A BURGOMASTER GULL WHEELING UNDER SEA VITCHS NOSE UGLIER AND WITH WORSE MANNERS STAREEK KOTICK SWAM BACK TO NOVASTOSHNAH LEAVING THE GULLS TO SCREAM THERE HE FOUND THAT NO ONE SYMPATHIZED WITH HIM IN HIS LITTLE ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER A QUIET PLACE FOR THE SEALS THEY TOLD HIM THAT MEN HAD ALWAYS DRIVEN THE HOLLUSCHICKIEIT WAS PART OF THE DAYS WORKAND THAT IF HE DID NOT LIKE TO SEE UGLY THINGS HE SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE TO THE KILLING GROUNDS BUT NONE OF THE OTHER SEALS HAD SEEN THE KILLING AND THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS FRIENDS BESIDES KOTICK WAS A WHITE SEAL WHAT YOU MUST DO SAID OLD SEA CATCH AFTER HE HAD HEARD HIS SONS ADVENTURES IS TO GROW UP AND BE A BIG SEAL LIKE YOUR FATHER AND HAVE A NURSERY ON THE BEACH AND THEN THEY WILL LEAVE YOU ALONE IN ANOTHER FIVE YEARS YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR YOURSELF EVEN GENTLE MATKAH HIS MOTHER SAID YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO STOP THE KILLING GO AND PLAY IN THE SEA KOTICK AND KOTICK WENT OFF AND DANCED THE FIREDANCE WITH A VERY HEAVY LITTLE HEART THAT AUTUMN HE LEFT THE BEACH AS SOON AS HE COULD AND SET OFF ALONE BECAUSE OF A NOTION IN HIS BULLETHEAD HE WAS GOING TO FIND SEA COW IF THERE WAS SUCH A PERSON IN THE SEA AND HE WAS GOING TO FIND A QUIET ISLAND WITH GOOD FIRM BEACHES FOR SEALS TO LIVE ON WHERE MEN COULD NOT GET AT THEM SO HE EXPLORED AND EXPLORED BY HIMSELF FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH PACIFIC SWIMMING AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED MILES IN A DAY AND A NIGHT HE MET WITH MORE ADVENTURES THAN CAN BE TOLD AND NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING CAUGHT BY THE BASKING SHARK AND THE SPOTTED SHARK AND THE HAMMERHEAD AND HE MET ALL THE UNTRUSTWORTHY RUFFIANS THAT LOAF UP AND DOWN THE SEAS AND THE HEAVY POLITE FISH AND THE SCARLET SPOTTED SCALLOPS THAT ARE MOORED IN ONE PLACE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND GROW VERY PROUD OF IT BUT HE NEVER MET SEA COW AND HE NEVER FOUND AN ISLAND THAT HE COULD FANCY IF THE BEACH WAS GOOD AND HARD WITH A SLOPE BEHIND IT FOR SEALS TO PLAY ON THERE WAS ALWAYS THE SMOKE OF A WHALER ON THE HORIZON BOILING DOWN BLUBBER AND KOTICK KNEW WHAT THAT MEANT OR ELSE HE COULD SEE THAT SEALS HAD ONCE VISITED THE ISLAND AND BEEN KILLED OFF AND KOTICK KNEW THAT WHERE MEN HAD COME ONCE THEY WOULD COME AGAIN HE PICKED UP WITH AN OLD STUMPYTAILED ALBATROSS WHO TOLD HIM THAT KERGUELEN ISLAND WAS THE VERY PLACE FOR PEACE AND QUIET AND WHEN KOTICK WENT DOWN THERE HE WAS ALL BUT SMASHED TO PIECES AGAINST SOME WICKED BLACK CLIFFS IN A HEAVY SLEETSTORM WITH LIGHTNING AND THUNDER YET AS HE PULLED OUT AGAINST THE GALE HE COULD SEE THAT EVEN THERE HAD ONCE BEEN A SEAL NURSERY AND IT WAS SO IN ALL THE OTHER ISLANDS THAT HE VISITED LIMMERSHIN GAVE A LONG LIST OF THEM FOR HE SAID THAT KOTICK SPENT FIVE SEASONS EXPLORING WITH A FOUR MONTHS REST EACH YEAR AT NOVASTOSHNAH WHEN THE HOLLUSCHICKIE USED TO MAKE FUN OF HIM AND HIS IMAGINARY ISLANDS HE WENT TO THE GALLAPAGOS A HORRID DRY PLACE ON THE EQUATOR WHERE HE WAS NEARLY BAKED TO DEATH HE WENT TO THE GEORGIA ISLANDS THE ORKNEYS EMERALD ISLAND LITTLE NIGHTINGALE ISLAND GOUGHS ISLAND BOUVETS ISLAND THE CROSSETS AND EVEN TO A LITTLE SPECK OF AN ISLAND SOUTH OF THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE BUT EVERYWHERE THE PEOPLE OF THE SEA TOLD HIM THE SAME THINGS SEALS HAD COME TO THOSE ISLANDS ONCE UPON A TIME BUT MEN HAD KILLED THEM ALL OFF EVEN WHEN HE SWAM THOUSANDS OF MILES OUT OF THE PACIFIC AND GOT TO A PLACE CALLED CAPE CORRIENTES THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS COMING BACK FROM GOUGHS ISLAND HE FOUND A FEW HUNDRED MANGY SEALS ON A ROCK AND THEY TOLD HIM THAT MEN CAME THERE TOO THAT NEARLY BROKE HIS HEART AND HE HEADED ROUND THE HORN BACK TO HIS OWN BEACHES AND ON HIS WAY NORTH HE HAULED OUT ON AN ISLAND FULL OF GREEN TREES WHERE HE FOUND AN OLD OLD SEAL WHO WAS DYING AND KOTICK CAUGHT FISH FOR HIM AND TOLD HIM ALL HIS SORROWS NOW SAID KOTICK I AM GOING BACK TO NOVASTOSHNAH AND IF I AM DRIVEN TO THE KILLINGPENS WITH THE HOLLUSCHICKIE I SHALL NOT CARE THE OLD SEAL SAID TRY ONCE MORE I AM THE LAST OF THE LOST ROOKERY OF MASAFUERA AND IN THE DAYS WHEN MEN KILLED US BY THE HUNDRED THOUSAND THERE WAS A STORY ON THE BEACHES THAT SOME DAY A WHITE SEAL WOULD COME OUT OF THE NORTH AND LEAD THE SEAL PEOPLE TO A QUIET PLACE I AM OLD AND I SHALL NEVER LIVE TO SEE THAT DAY BUT OTHERS WILL TRY ONCE MORE AND KOTICK CURLED UP HIS MUSTACHE IT WAS A BEAUTY AND SAID I AM THE ONLY WHITE SEAL THAT HAS EVER BEEN BORN ON THE BEACHES AND I AM THE ONLY SEAL BLACK OR WHITE WHO EVER THOUGHT OF LOOKING FOR NEW ISLANDS THIS CHEERED HIM IMMENSELY AND WHEN HE CAME BACK TO NOVASTOSHNAH THAT SUMMER MATKAH HIS MOTHER BEGGED HIM TO MARRY AND SETTLE DOWN FOR HE WAS NO LONGER A HOLLUSCHICK BUT A FULLGROWN SEACATCH WITH A CURLY WHITE MANE ON HIS SHOULDERS AS HEAVY AS BIG AND AS FIERCE AS HIS FATHER GIVE ME ANOTHER SEASON HE SAID REMEMBER MOTHER IT IS ALWAYS THE SEVENTH WAVE THAT GOES FARTHEST UP THE BEACH CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THERE WAS ANOTHER SEAL WHO THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD PUT OFF MARRYING TILL THE NEXT YEAR AND KOTICK DANCED THE FIREDANCE WITH HER ALL DOWN LUKANNON BEACH THE NIGHT BEFORE HE SET OFF ON HIS LAST EXPLORATION THIS TIME HE WENT WESTWARD BECAUSE HE HAD FALLEN ON THE TRAIL OF A GREAT SHOAL OF HALIBUT AND HE NEEDED AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED POUNDS OF FISH A DAY TO KEEP HIM IN GOOD CONDITION HE CHASED THEM TILL HE WAS TIRED AND THEN HE CURLED HIMSELF UP AND WENT TO SLEEP ON THE HOLLOWS OF THE GROUND SWELL THAT SETS IN TO COPPER ISLAND HE KNEW THE COAST PERFECTLY WELL SO ABOUT MIDNIGHT WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF GENTLY BUMPED ON A WEEDBED HE SAID HM TIDES RUNNING STRONG TONIGHT AND TURNING OVER UNDER WATER OPENED HIS EYES SLOWLY AND STRETCHED THEN HE JUMPED LIKE A CAT FOR HE SAW HUGE THINGS NOSING ABOUT IN THE SHOAL WATER AND BROWSING ON THE HEAVY FRINGES OF THE WEEDS BY THE GREAT COMBERS OF MAGELLAN HE SAID BENEATH HIS MUSTACHE WHO IN THE DEEP SEA ARE THESE PEOPLE THEY WERE LIKE NO WALRUS SEA LION SEAL BEAR WHALE SHARK FISH SQUID OR SCALLOP THAT KOTICK HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE THEY WERE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY FEET LONG AND THEY HAD NO HIND FLIPPERS BUT A SHOVELLIKE TAIL THAT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN WHITTLED OUT OF WET LEATHER THEIR HEADS WERE THE MOST FOOLISHLOOKING THINGS YOU EVER SAW AND THEY BALANCED ON THE ENDS OF THEIR TAILS IN DEEP WATER WHEN THEY WERENT GRAZING BOWING SOLEMNLY TO EACH OTHER AND WAVING THEIR FRONT FLIPPERS AS A FAT MAN WAVES HIS ARM AHEM SAID KOTICK GOOD SPORT GENTLEMEN THE BIG THINGS ANSWERED BY BOWING AND WAVING THEIR FLIPPERS LIKE THE FROG FOOTMAN WHEN THEY BEGAN FEEDING AGAIN KOTICK SAW THAT THEIR UPPER LIP WAS SPLIT INTO TWO PIECES THAT THEY COULD TWITCH APART ABOUT A FOOT AND BRING TOGETHER AGAIN WITH A WHOLE BUSHEL OF SEAWEED BETWEEN THE SPLITS THEY TUCKED THE STUFF INTO THEIR MOUTHS AND CHUMPED SOLEMNLY MESSY STYLE OF FEEDING THAT SAID KOTICK THEY BOWED AGAIN AND KOTICK BEGAN TO LOSE HIS TEMPER VERY GOOD HE SAID IF YOU DO HAPPEN TO HAVE AN EXTRA JOINT IN YOUR FRONT FLIPPER YOU NEEDNT SHOW OFF SO I SEE YOU BOW GRACEFULLY BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR NAMES THE SPLIT LIPS MOVED AND TWITCHED AND THE GLASSY GREEN EYES STARED BUT THEY DID NOT SPEAK WELL SAID KOTICK YOURE THE ONLY PEOPLE IVE EVER MET UGLIER THAN SEA VITCHAND WITH WORSE MANNERS THEN HE REMEMBERED IN A FLASH WHAT THE BURGOMASTER GULL HAD SCREAMED TO HIM WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE YEARLING AT WALRUS ISLET AND HE TUMBLED BACKWARD IN THE WATER FOR HE KNEW THAT HE HAD FOUND SEA COW AT LAST THE SEA COWS WENT ON SCHLOOPING AND GRAZING AND CHUMPING IN THE WEED AND KOTICK ASKED THEM QUESTIONS IN EVERY LANGUAGE THAT HE HAD PICKED UP IN HIS TRAVELS AND THE SEA PEOPLE TALK NEARLY AS MANY LANGUAGES AS HUMAN BEINGS BUT THE SEA COWS DID NOT ANSWER BECAUSE SEA COW CANNOT TALK HE HAS ONLY SIX BONES IN HIS NECK WHERE HE OUGHT TO HAVE SEVEN AND THEY SAY UNDER THE SEA THAT THAT PREVENTS HIM FROM SPEAKING EVEN TO HIS COMPANIONS BUT AS YOU KNOW HE HAS AN EXTRA JOINT IN HIS FOREFLIPPER AND BY WAVING IT UP AND DOWN AND ABOUT HE MAKES WHAT ANSWERS TO A SORT OF CLUMSY TELEGRAPHIC CODE BY DAYLIGHT KOTICKS MANE WAS STANDING ON END AND HIS TEMPER WAS GONE WHERE THE DEAD CRABS GO THEN THE SEA COW BEGAN TO TRAVEL NORTHWARD VERY SLOWLY STOPPING TO HOLD ABSURD BOWING COUNCILS FROM TIME TO TIME AND KOTICK FOLLOWED THEM SAYING TO HIMSELF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCH IDIOTS AS THESE ARE WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED LONG AGO IF THEY HADNT FOUND OUT SOME SAFE ISLAND AND WHAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE SEA COW IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE SEA CATCH ALL THE SAME I WISH THEYD HURRY IT WAS WEARY WORK FOR KOTICK THE HERD NEVER WENT MORE THAN FORTY OR FIFTY MILES A DAY AND STOPPED TO FEED AT NIGHT AND KEPT CLOSE TO THE SHORE ALL THE TIME WHILE KOTICK SWAM ROUND THEM AND OVER THEM AND UNDER THEM BUT HE COULD NOT HURRY THEM UP ONEHALF MILE AS THEY WENT FARTHER NORTH THEY HELD A BOWING COUNCIL EVERY FEW HOURS AND KOTICK NEARLY BIT OFF HIS MUSTACHE WITH IMPATIENCE TILL HE SAW THAT THEY WERE FOLLOWING UP A WARM CURRENT OF WATER AND THEN HE RESPECTED THEM MORE ONE NIGHT THEY SANK THROUGH THE SHINY WATERSANK LIKE STONESAND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE HAD KNOWN THEM BEGAN TO SWIM QUICKLY KOTICK FOLLOWED AND THE PACE ASTONISHED HIM FOR HE NEVER DREAMED THAT SEA COW WAS ANYTHING OF A SWIMMER THEY HEADED FOR A CLIFF BY THE SHOREA CLIFF THAT RAN DOWN INTO DEEP WATER AND PLUNGED INTO A DARK HOLE AT THE FOOT OF IT TWENTY FATHOMS UNDER THE SEA IT WAS A LONG LONG SWIM AND KOTICK BADLY WANTED FRESH AIR BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF THE DARK TUNNEL THEY LED HIM THROUGH MY WIG HE SAID WHEN HE ROSE GASPING AND PUFFING INTO OPEN WATER AT THE FARTHER END IT WAS A LONG DIVE BUT IT WAS WORTH IT THE SEA COWS HAD SEPARATED AND WERE BROWSING LAZILY ALONG THE EDGES OF THE FINEST BEACHES THAT KOTICK HAD EVER SEEN THERE WERE LONG STRETCHES OF SMOOTHWORN ROCK RUNNING FOR MILES EXACTLY FITTED TO MAKE SEALNURSERIES AND THERE WERE PLAYGROUNDS OF HARD SAND SLOPING INLAND BEHIND THEM AND THERE WERE ROLLERS FOR SEALS TO DANCE IN AND LONG GRASS TO ROLL IN AND SAND DUNES TO CLIMB UP AND DOWN AND BEST OF ALL KOTICK KNEW BY THE FEEL OF THE WATER WHICH NEVER DECEIVES A TRUE SEA CATCH THAT NO MEN HAD EVER COME THERE THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT THE FISHING WAS GOOD AND THEN HE SWAM ALONG THE BEACHES AND COUNTED UP THE DELIGHTFUL LOW SANDY ISLANDS HALF HIDDEN IN THE BEAUTIFUL ROLLING FOG AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD OUT TO SEA RAN A LINE OF BARS AND SHOALS AND ROCKS THAT WOULD NEVER LET A SHIP COME WITHIN SIX MILES OF THE BEACH AND BETWEEN THE ISLANDS AND THE MAINLAND WAS A STRETCH OF DEEP WATER THAT RAN UP TO THE PERPENDICULAR CLIFFS AND SOMEWHERE BELOW THE CLIFFS WAS THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL ITS NOVASTOSHNAH OVER AGAIN BUT TEN TIMES BETTER SAID KOTICK SEA COW MUST BE WISER THAN I THOUGHT MEN CANT COME DOWN THE CLIFFS EVEN IF THERE WERE ANY MEN AND THE SHOALS TO SEAWARD WOULD KNOCK A SHIP TO SPLINTERS IF ANY PLACE IN THE SEA IS SAFE THIS IS IT HE BEGAN TO THINK OF THE SEAL HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM BUT THOUGH HE WAS IN A HURRY TO GO BACK TO NOVASTOSHNAH HE THOROUGHLY EXPLORED THE NEW COUNTRY SO THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS THEN HE DIVED AND MADE SURE OF THE MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL AND RACED THROUGH TO THE SOUTHWARD NO ONE BUT A SEA COW OR A SEAL WOULD HAVE DREAMED OF THERE BEING SUCH A PLACE AND WHEN HE LOOKED BACK AT THE CLIFFS EVEN KOTICK COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT HE HAD BEEN UNDER THEM HE WAS SIX DAYS GOING HOME THOUGH HE WAS NOT SWIMMING SLOWLY AND WHEN HE HAULED OUT JUST ABOVE SEA LIONS NECK THE FIRST PERSON HE MET WAS THE SEAL WHO HAD BEEN WAITING FOR HIM AND SHE SAW BY THE LOOK IN HIS EYES THAT HE HAD FOUND HIS ISLAND AT LAST BUT THE HOLLUSCHICKIE AND SEA CATCH HIS FATHER AND ALL THE OTHER SEALS LAUGHED AT HIM WHEN HE TOLD THEM WHAT HE HAD DISCOVERED AND A YOUNG SEAL ABOUT HIS OWN AGE SAID THIS IS ALL VERY WELL KOTICK BUT YOU CANT COME FROM NO ONE KNOWS WHERE AND ORDER US OFF LIKE THIS REMEMBER WEVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR OUR NURSERIES AND THATS A THING YOU NEVER DID YOU PREFERRED PROWLING ABOUT IN THE SEA THE OTHER SEALS LAUGHED AT THIS AND THE YOUNG SEAL BEGAN TWISTING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE HE HAD JUST MARRIED THAT YEAR AND WAS MAKING A GREAT FUSS ABOUT IT IVE NO NURSERY TO FIGHT FOR SAID KOTICK I ONLY WANT TO SHOW YOU ALL A PLACE WHERE YOU WILL BE SAFE WHATS THE USE OF FIGHTING OH IF YOURE TRYING TO BACK OUT OF COURSE IVE NO MORE TO SAY SAID THE YOUNG SEAL WITH AN UGLY CHUCKLE WILL YOU COME WITH ME IF I WIN SAID KOTICK AND A GREEN LIGHT CAME INTO HIS EYE FOR HE WAS VERY ANGRY AT HAVING TO FIGHT AT ALL VERY GOOD SAID THE YOUNG SEAL CARELESSLY IF YOU WIN ILL COME HE HAD NO TIME TO CHANGE HIS MIND FOR KOTICKS HEAD WAS OUT AND HIS TEETH SUNK IN THE BLUBBER OF THE YOUNG SEALS NECK THEN HE THREW HIMSELF BACK ON HIS HAUNCHES AND HAULED HIS ENEMY DOWN THE BEACH SHOOK HIM AND KNOCKED HIM OVER THEN KOTICK ROARED TO THE SEALS IVE DONE MY BEST FOR YOU THESE FIVE SEASONS PAST IVE FOUND YOU THE ISLAND WHERE YOULL BE SAFE BUT UNLESS YOUR HEADS ARE DRAGGED OFF YOUR SILLY NECKS YOU WONT BELIEVE IM GOING TO TEACH YOU NOW LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELVES LIMMERSHIN TOLD ME THAT NEVER IN HIS LIFEAND LIMMERSHIN SEES TEN THOUSAND BIG SEALS FIGHTING EVERY YEARNEVER IN ALL HIS LITTLE LIFE DID HE SEE ANYTHING LIKE KOTICKS CHARGE INTO THE NURSERIES HE FLUNG HIMSELF AT THE BIGGEST SEA CATCH HE COULD FIND CAUGHT HIM BY THE THROAT CHOKED HIM AND BUMPED HIM AND BANGED HIM TILL HE GRUNTED FOR MERCY AND THEN THREW HIM ASIDE AND ATTACKED THE NEXT YOU SEE KOTICK HAD NEVER FASTED FOR FOUR MONTHS AS THE BIG SEALS DID EVERY YEAR AND HIS DEEPSEA SWIMMING TRIPS KEPT HIM IN PERFECT CONDITION AND BEST OF ALL HE HAD NEVER FOUGHT BEFORE HIS CURLY WHITE MANE STOOD UP WITH RAGE AND HIS EYES FLAMED AND HIS BIG DOG TEETH GLISTENED AND HE WAS SPLENDID TO LOOK AT OLD SEA CATCH HIS FATHER SAW HIM TEARING PAST HAULING THE GRIZZLED OLD SEALS ABOUT AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN HALIBUT AND UPSETTING THE YOUNG BACHELORS IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND SEA CATCH GAVE A ROAR AND SHOUTED HE MAY BE A FOOL BUT HE IS THE BEST FIGHTER ON THE BEACHES DONT TACKLE YOUR FATHER MY SON HES WITH YOU KOTICK ROARED IN ANSWER AND OLD SEA CATCH WADDLED IN WITH HIS MUSTACHE ON END BLOWING LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE WHILE MATKAH AND THE SEAL THAT WAS GOING TO MARRY KOTICK COWERED DOWN AND ADMIRED THEIR MENFOLK IT WAS A GORGEOUS FIGHT FOR THE TWO FOUGHT AS LONG AS THERE WAS A SEAL THAT DARED LIFT UP HIS HEAD AND WHEN THERE WERE NONE THEY PARADED GRANDLY UP AND DOWN THE BEACH SIDE BY SIDE BELLOWING AT NIGHT JUST AS THE NORTHERN LIGHTS WERE WINKING AND FLASHING THROUGH THE FOG KOTICK CLIMBED A BARE ROCK AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE SCATTERED NURSERIES AND THE TORN AND BLEEDING SEALS NOW HE SAID IVE TAUGHT YOU YOUR LESSON MY WIG SAID OLD SEA CATCH BOOSTING HIMSELF UP STIFFLY FOR HE WAS FEARFULLY MAULED THE KILLER WHALE HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE CUT THEM UP WORSE SON IM PROUD OF YOU AND WHATS MORE ILL COME WITH YOU TO YOUR ISLANDIF THERE IS SUCH A PLACE HEAR YOU FAT PIGS OF THE SEA WHO COMES WITH ME TO THE SEA COWS TUNNEL ANSWER OR I SHALL TEACH YOU AGAIN ROARED KOTICK THERE WAS A MURMUR LIKE THE RIPPLE OF THE TIDE ALL UP AND DOWN THE BEACHES WE WILL COME SAID THOUSANDS OF TIRED VOICES WE WILL FOLLOW KOTICK THE WHITE SEAL THEN KOTICK DROPPED HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS AND SHUT HIS EYES PROUDLY HE WAS NOT A WHITE SEAL ANY MORE BUT RED FROM HEAD TO TAIL ALL THE SAME HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED TO LOOK AT OR TOUCH ONE OF HIS WOUNDS A WEEK LATER HE AND HIS ARMY NEARLY TEN THOUSAND HOLLUSCHICKIE AND OLD SEALS WENT AWAY NORTH TO THE SEA COWS TUNNEL KOTICK LEADING THEM AND THE SEALS THAT STAYED AT NOVASTOSHNAH CALLED THEM IDIOTS BUT NEXT SPRING WHEN THEY ALL MET OFF THE FISHING BANKS OF THE PACIFIC KOTICKS SEALS TOLD SUCH TALES OF THE NEW BEACHES BEYOND SEA COWS TUNNEL THAT MORE AND MORE SEALS LEFT NOVASTOSHNAH OF COURSE IT WAS NOT ALL DONE AT ONCE FOR THE SEALS ARE NOT VERY CLEVER AND THEY NEED A LONG TIME TO TURN THINGS OVER IN THEIR MINDS BUT YEAR AFTER YEAR MORE SEALS WENT AWAY FROM NOVASTOSHNAH AND LUKANNON AND THE OTHER NURSERIES TO THE QUIET SHELTERED BEACHES WHERE KOTICK SITS ALL THE SUMMER THROUGH GETTING BIGGER AND FATTER AND STRONGER EACH YEAR WHILE THE HOLLUSCHICKIE PLAY AROUND HIM IN THAT SEA WHERE NO MAN COMES LUKANNON THIS IS THE GREAT DEEPSEA SONG THAT ALL THE ST PAUL SEALS SING WHEN THEY ARE HEADING BACK TO THEIR

WHEN ONE IS DEAD AT THY PLEASURE NAG TURN FOR TURN AND TWIST FOR TWIST RUN AND HIDE THEE NAG HAH THE HOODED DEATH HAS MISSED WOE BETIDE THEE NAG THIS IS THE STORY OF THE GREAT WAR THAT RIKKITIKKITAVI FOUGHT SINGLEHANDED THROUGH THE BATHROOMS OF THE BIG BUNGALOW IN SEGOWLEE CANTONMENT DARZEE THE TAILORBIRD HELPED HIM AND CHUCHUNDRA THE MUSKRAT WHO NEVER COMES OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR BUT ALWAYS CREEPS ROUND BY THE WALL GAVE HIM ADVICE BUT RIKKITIKKI DID THE REAL FIGHTING HE WAS A MONGOOSE RATHER LIKE A LITTLE CAT IN HIS FUR AND HIS TAIL BUT QUITE LIKE A WEASEL IN HIS HEAD AND HIS HABITS HIS EYES AND THE END OF HIS RESTLESS NOSE WERE PINK HE COULD SCRATCH HIMSELF ANYWHERE HE PLEASED WITH ANY LEG FRONT OR BACK THAT HE CHOSE TO USE HE COULD FLUFF UP HIS TAIL TILL IT LOOKED LIKE A BOTTLE BRUSH AND HIS WAR CRY AS HE SCUTTLED THROUGH THE LONG GRASS WAS RIKKTIKKTIKKITIKKITCHK ONE DAY A HIGH SUMMER FLOOD WASHED HIM OUT OF THE BURROW WHERE HE LIVED WITH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND CARRIED HIM KICKING AND CLUCKING DOWN A ROADSIDE DITCH HE FOUND A LITTLE WISP OF GRASS FLOATING THERE AND CLUNG TO IT TILL HE LOST HIS SENSES WHEN HE REVIVED HE WAS LYING IN THE HOT SUN ON THE MIDDLE OF A GARDEN PATH VERY DRAGGLED INDEED AND A SMALL BOY WAS SAYING HERES A DEAD MONGOOSE LETS HAVE A FUNERAL NO SAID HIS MOTHER LETS TAKE HIM IN AND DRY HIM PERHAPS HE ISNT REALLY DEAD THEY TOOK HIM INTO THE HOUSE AND A BIG MAN PICKED HIM UP BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB AND SAID HE WAS NOT DEAD BUT HALF CHOKED SO THEY WRAPPED HIM IN COTTON WOOL AND WARMED HIM OVER A LITTLE FIRE AND HE OPENED HIS EYES AND SNEEZED NOW SAID THE BIG MAN HE WAS AN ENGLISHMAN WHO HAD JUST MOVED INTO THE BUNGALOW DONT FRIGHTEN HIM AND WELL SEE WHAT HELL DO IT IS THE HARDEST THING IN THE WORLD TO FRIGHTEN A MONGOOSE BECAUSE HE IS EATEN UP FROM NOSE TO TAIL WITH CURIOSITY THE MOTTO OF ALL THE MONGOOSE FAMILY IS RUN AND FIND OUT AND RIKKITIKKI WAS A TRUE MONGOOSE HE LOOKED AT THE COTTON WOOL DECIDED THAT IT WAS NOT GOOD TO EAT RAN ALL ROUND THE TABLE SAT UP AND PUT HIS FUR IN ORDER SCRATCHED HIMSELF AND JUMPED ON THE SMALL BOYS SHOULDER DONT BE FRIGHTENED TEDDY SAID HIS FATHER THATS HIS WAY OF MAKING FRIENDS OUCH HES TICKLING UNDER MY CHIN SAID TEDDY RIKKITIKKI LOOKED DOWN BETWEEN THE BOYS COLLAR AND NECK SNUFFED AT HIS EAR AND CLIMBED DOWN TO THE FLOOR WHERE HE SAT RUBBING HIS NOSE GOOD GRACIOUS SAID TEDDYS MOTHER AND THATS A WILD CREATURE I SUPPOSE HES SO TAME BECAUSE WEVE BEEN KIND TO HIM ALL MONGOOSES ARE LIKE THAT SAID HER HUSBAND IF TEDDY DOESNT PICK HIM UP BY THE TAIL OR TRY TO PUT HIM IN A CAGE HELL RUN IN AND OUT OF THE HOUSE ALL DAY LONG LETS GIVE HIM SOMETHING TO EAT THEY GAVE HIM A LITTLE PIECE OF RAW MEAT RIKKITIKKI LIKED IT IMMENSELY AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HE WENT OUT INTO THE VERANDA AND SAT IN THE SUNSHINE AND FLUFFED UP HIS FUR TO MAKE IT DRY TO THE ROOTS THEN HE FELT BETTER THERE ARE MORE THINGS TO FIND OUT ABOUT IN THIS HOUSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAN ALL MY FAMILY COULD FIND OUT IN ALL THEIR LIVES I SHALL CERTAINLY STAY AND FIND OUT HE SPENT ALL THAT DAY ROAMING OVER THE HOUSE HE NEARLY DROWNED HIMSELF IN THE BATHTUBS PUT HIS NOSE INTO THE INK ON A WRITING TABLE AND BURNED IT ON THE END OF THE BIG MANS CIGAR FOR HE CLIMBED UP IN THE BIG MANS LAP TO SEE HOW WRITING WAS DONE AT NIGHTFALL HE RAN INTO TEDDYS NURSERY TO WATCH HOW KEROSENE LAMPS WERE LIGHTED AND WHEN TEDDY WENT TO BED RIKKITIKKI CLIMBED UP TOO BUT HE WAS A RESTLESS COMPANION BECAUSE HE HAD TO GET UP AND ATTEND TO EVERY NOISE ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT AND FIND OUT WHAT MADE IT TEDDYS MOTHER AND FATHER CAME IN THE LAST THING TO LOOK AT THEIR BOY AND RIKKITIKKI WAS AWAKE ON THE PILLOW I DONT LIKE THAT SAID TEDDYS MOTHER HE MAY BITE THE CHILD HELL DO NO SUCH THING SAID THE FATHER TEDDYS SAFER WITH THAT LITTLE BEAST THAN IF HE HAD A BLOODHOUND TO WATCH HIM IF A SNAKE CAME INTO THE NURSERY NOW BUT TEDDYS MOTHER WOULDNT THINK OF ANYTHING SO AWFUL EARLY IN THE MORNING RIKKITIKKI CAME TO EARLY BREAKFAST IN THE VERANDA RIDING ON TEDDYS SHOULDER AND THEY GAVE HIM BANANA AND SOME BOILED EGG HE SAT ON ALL THEIR LAPS ONE AFTER THE OTHER BECAUSE EVERY WELLBROUGHTUP MONGOOSE ALWAYS HOPES TO BE A HOUSE MONGOOSE SOME DAY AND HAVE ROOMS TO RUN ABOUT IN AND RIKKITIKKIS MOTHER SHE USED TO LIVE IN THE GENERALS HOUSE AT SEGOWLEE HAD CAREFULLY TOLD RIKKI WHAT TO DO IF EVER HE CAME ACROSS WHITE MEN THEN RIKKITIKKI WENT OUT INTO THE GARDEN TO SEE WHAT WAS TO BE SEEN IT WAS A LARGE GARDEN ONLY HALF CULTIVATED WITH BUSHES AS BIG AS SUMMERHOUSES OF MARSHAL NIEL ROSES LIME AND ORANGE TREES CLUMPS OF BAMBOOS AND THICKETS OF HIGH GRASS RIKKITIKKI LICKED HIS LIPS THIS IS A SPLENDID HUNTINGGROUND HE SAID AND HIS TAIL GREW BOTTLEBRUSHY AT THE THOUGHT OF IT AND HE SCUTTLED UP AND DOWN THE GARDEN SNUFFING HERE AND THERE TILL HE HEARD VERY SORROWFUL VOICES IN A THORNBUSH IT WAS DARZEE THE TAILORBIRD AND HIS WIFE THEY HAD MADE A BEAUTIFUL NEST BY PULLING TWO BIG LEAVES TOGETHER AND STITCHING THEM UP THE EDGES WITH FIBERS AND HAD FILLED THE HOLLOW WITH COTTON AND DOWNY FLUFF THE NEST SWAYED TO AND FRO AS THEY SAT ON THE RIM AND CRIED WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED RIKKITIKKI WE ARE VERY MISERABLE SAID DARZEE ONE OF OUR BABIES FELL OUT OF THE NEST YESTERDAY AND NAG ATE HIM HM SAID RIKKITIKKI THAT IS VERY SADBUT I AM A STRANGER HERE WHO IS NAG DARZEE AND HIS WIFE ONLY COWERED DOWN IN THE NEST WITHOUT ANSWERING FOR FROM THE THICK GRASS AT THE FOOT OF THE BUSH THERE CAME A LOW HISSA HORRID COLD SOUND THAT MADE RIKKITIKKI JUMP BACK TWO CLEAR FEET THEN INCH BY INCH OUT OF THE GRASS ROSE UP THE HEAD AND SPREAD HOOD OF NAG THE BIG BLACK COBRA AND HE WAS FIVE FEET LONG FROM TONGUE TO TAIL WHEN HE HAD LIFTED ONETHIRD OF HIMSELF CLEAR OF THE GROUND HE STAYED BALANCING TO AND FRO EXACTLY AS A DANDELION TUFT BALANCES IN THE WIND AND HE LOOKED AT RIKKITIKKI WITH THE WICKED SNAKES EYES THAT NEVER CHANGE THEIR EXPRESSION WHATEVER THE SNAKE MAY BE THINKING OF WHO IS NAG SAID HE I AM NAG THE GREAT GOD BRAHM PUT HIS MARK UPON ALL OUR PEOPLE WHEN THE FIRST COBRA SPREAD HIS HOOD TO KEEP THE SUN OFF BRAHM AS HE SLEPT LOOK AND BE AFRAID HE SPREAD OUT HIS HOOD MORE THAN EVER AND RIKKITIKKI SAW THE SPECTACLEMARK ON THE BACK OF IT THAT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE EYE PART OF A HOOKANDEYE FASTENING HE WAS AFRAID FOR THE MINUTE BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MONGOOSE TO STAY FRIGHTENED FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME AND THOUGH RIKKITIKKI HAD NEVER MET A LIVE COBRA BEFORE HIS MOTHER HAD FED HIM ON DEAD ONES AND HE KNEW THAT ALL A GROWN MONGOOSES BUSINESS IN LIFE WAS TO FIGHT AND EAT SNAKES NAG KNEW THAT TOO AND AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS COLD HEART HE WAS AFRAID WELL SAID RIKKITIKKI AND HIS TAIL BEGAN TO FLUFF UP AGAIN MARKS OR NO MARKS DO YOU THINK IT IS RIGHT FOR YOU TO EAT FLEDGLINGS OUT OF A NEST NAG WAS THINKING TO HIMSELF AND WATCHING THE LEAST LITTLE MOVEMENT IN THE GRASS BEHIND RIKKITIKKI HE KNEW THAT MONGOOSES IN THE GARDEN MEANT DEATH SOONER OR LATER FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY BUT HE WANTED TO GET RIKKITIKKI OFF HIS GUARD SO HE DROPPED HIS HEAD A LITTLE AND PUT IT ON ONE SIDE LET US TALK HE SAID YOU EAT EGGS WHY SHOULD NOT I EAT BIRDS BEHIND YOU LOOK BEHIND YOU SANG DARZEE RIKKITIKKI KNEW BETTER THAN TO WASTE TIME IN STARING HE JUMPED UP IN THE AIR AS HIGH AS HE COULD GO AND JUST UNDER HIM WHIZZED BY THE HEAD OF NAGAINA NAGS WICKED WIFE SHE HAD CREPT UP BEHIND HIM AS HE WAS TALKING TO MAKE AN END OF HIM HE HEARD HER SAVAGE HISS AS THE STROKE MISSED HE CAME DOWN ALMOST ACROSS HER BACK AND IF HE HAD BEEN AN OLD MONGOOSE HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THEN WAS THE TIME TO BREAK HER BACK WITH ONE BITE BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE TERRIBLE LASHING RETURN STROKE OF THE COBRA HE BIT INDEED BUT DID NOT BITE LONG ENOUGH AND HE JUMPED CLEAR OF THE WHISKING TAIL LEAVING NAGAINA TORN AND ANGRY WICKED WICKED DARZEE SAID NAG LASHING UP AS HIGH AS HE COULD REACH TOWARD THE NEST IN THE THORNBUSH BUT DARZEE HAD BUILT IT OUT OF REACH OF SNAKES AND IT ONLY SWAYED TO AND FRO RIKKITIKKI FELT HIS EYES GROWING RED AND HOT WHEN A MONGOOSES EYES GROW RED HE IS ANGRY AND HE SAT BACK ON HIS TAIL AND HIND LEGS LIKE A LITTLE KANGAROO AND LOOKED ALL ROUND HIM AND CHATTERED WITH RAGE BUT NAG AND NAGAINA HAD DISAPPEARED INTO THE GRASS WHEN A SNAKE MISSES ITS STROKE IT NEVER SAYS ANYTHING OR GIVES ANY SIGN OF WHAT IT MEANS TO DO NEXT RIKKITIKKI DID NOT CARE TO FOLLOW THEM FOR HE DID NOT FEEL SURE THAT HE COULD MANAGE TWO SNAKES AT ONCE SO HE TROTTED OFF TO THE GRAVEL PATH NEAR THE HOUSE AND SAT DOWN TO THINK IT WAS A SERIOUS MATTER FOR HIM IF YOU READ THE OLD BOOKS OF NATURAL HISTORY YOU WILL FIND THEY SAY THAT WHEN THE MONGOOSE FIGHTS THE SNAKE AND HAPPENS TO GET BITTEN HE RUNS OFF AND EATS SOME HERB THAT CURES HIM THAT IS NOT TRUE THE VICTORY IS ONLY A MATTER OF QUICKNESS OF EYE AND QUICKNESS OF FOOTSNAKES BLOW AGAINST MONGOOSES JUMPAND AS NO EYE CAN FOLLOW THE MOTION OF A SNAKES HEAD WHEN IT STRIKES THIS MAKES THINGS MUCH MORE WONDERFUL THAN ANY MAGIC HERB RIKKITIKKI KNEW HE WAS A YOUNG MONGOOSE AND IT MADE HIM ALL THE MORE PLEASED TO THINK THAT HE HAD MANAGED TO ESCAPE A BLOW FROM BEHIND IT GAVE HIM CONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF AND WHEN TEDDY CAME RUNNING DOWN THE PATH RIKKITIKKI WAS READY TO BE PETTED BUT JUST AS TEDDY WAS STOOPING SOMETHING WRIGGLED A LITTLE IN THE DUST AND A TINY VOICE SAID BE CAREFUL I AM DEATH IT WAS KARAIT THE DUSTY BROWN SNAKELING THAT LIES FOR CHOICE ON THE DUSTY EARTH AND HIS BITE IS AS DANGEROUS AS THE COBRAS BUT HE IS SO SMALL THAT NOBODY THINKS OF HIM AND SO HE DOES THE MORE HARM TO PEOPLE RIKKITIKKIS EYES GREW RED AGAIN AND HE DANCED UP TO KARAIT WITH THE PECULIAR ROCKING SWAYING MOTION THAT HE HAD INHERITED FROM HIS FAMILY IT LOOKS VERY FUNNY BUT IT IS SO PERFECTLY BALANCED A GAIT THAT YOU CAN FLY OFF FROM IT AT ANY ANGLE YOU PLEASE AND IN DEALING WITH SNAKES THIS IS AN ADVANTAGE IF RIKKITIKKI HAD ONLY KNOWN HE WAS DOING A MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THING THAN FIGHTING NAG FOR KARAIT IS SO SMALL AND CAN TURN SO QUICKLY THAT UNLESS RIKKI BIT HIM CLOSE TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD HE WOULD GET THE RETURN STROKE IN HIS EYE OR HIS LIP BUT RIKKI DID NOT KNOW HIS EYES WERE ALL RED AND HE ROCKED BACK AND FORTH LOOKING FOR A GOOD PLACE TO HOLD KARAIT STRUCK OUT RIKKI JUMPED SIDEWAYS AND TRIED TO RUN IN BUT THE WICKED LITTLE DUSTY GRAY HEAD LASHED WITHIN A FRACTION OF HIS SHOULDER AND HE HAD TO JUMP OVER THE BODY AND THE HEAD FOLLOWED HIS HEELS CLOSE TEDDY SHOUTED TO THE HOUSE OH LOOK HERE OUR MONGOOSE IS KILLING A SNAKE AND RIKKITIKKI HEARD A SCREAM FROM TEDDYS MOTHER HIS FATHER RAN OUT WITH A STICK BUT BY THE TIME HE CAME UP KARAIT HAD LUNGED OUT ONCE TOO FAR AND RIKKITIKKI HAD SPRUNG JUMPED ON THE SNAKES BACK DROPPED HIS HEAD FAR BETWEEN HIS FORELEGS BITTEN AS HIGH UP THE BACK AS HE COULD GET HOLD AND ROLLED AWAY THAT BITE PARALYZED KARAIT AND RIKKITIKKI WAS JUST GOING TO EAT HIM UP FROM THE TAIL AFTER THE CUSTOM OF HIS FAMILY AT DINNER WHEN HE REMEMBERED THAT A FULL MEAL MAKES A SLOW MONGOOSE AND IF HE WANTED ALL HIS STRENGTH AND QUICKNESS READY HE MUST KEEP HIMSELF THIN HE WENT AWAY FOR A DUST BATH UNDER THE CASTOROIL BUSHES WHILE TEDDYS FATHER BEAT THE DEAD KARAIT WHAT IS THE USE OF THAT THOUGHT RIKKITIKKI I HAVE SETTLED IT ALL AND THEN TEDDYS MOTHER PICKED HIM UP FROM THE DUST AND HUGGED HIM CRYING THAT HE HAD SAVED TEDDY FROM DEATH AND TEDDYS FATHER SAID THAT HE WAS A PROVIDENCE AND TEDDY LOOKED ON WITH BIG SCARED EYES RIKKITIKKI WAS RATHER AMUSED AT ALL THE FUSS WHICH OF COURSE HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND TEDDYS MOTHER MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE PETTED TEDDY FOR PLAYING IN THE DUST RIKKI WAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYING HIMSELF THAT NIGHT AT DINNER WALKING TO AND FRO AMONG THE WINEGLASSES ON THE TABLE HE MIGHT HAVE STUFFED HIMSELF THREE TIMES OVER WITH NICE THINGS BUT HE REMEMBERED NAG AND NAGAINA AND THOUGH IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TO BE PATTED AND PETTED BY TEDDYS MOTHER AND TO SIT ON TEDDYS SHOULDER HIS EYES WOULD GET RED FROM TIME TO TIME AND HE WOULD GO OFF INTO HIS LONG WAR CRY OF RIKKTIKKTIKKITIKKITCHK TEDDY CARRIED HIM OFF TO BED AND INSISTED ON RIKKITIKKI SLEEPING UNDER HIS CHIN RIKKITIKKI WAS TOO WELL BRED TO BITE OR SCRATCH BUT AS SOON AS TEDDY WAS ASLEEP HE WENT OFF FOR HIS NIGHTLY WALK ROUND THE HOUSE AND IN THE DARK HE RAN UP AGAINST CHUCHUNDRA THE MUSKRAT CREEPING AROUND BY THE WALL CHUCHUNDRA IS A BROKENHEARTED LITTLE BEAST HE WHIMPERS AND CHEEPS ALL THE NIGHT TRYING TO MAKE UP HIS MIND TO RUN INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM BUT HE NEVER GETS THERE DONT KILL ME SAID CHUCHUNDRA ALMOST WEEPING RIKKITIKKI DONT KILL ME DO YOU THINK A SNAKEKILLER KILLS MUSKRATS SAID RIKKITIKKI SCORNFULLY THOSE WHO KILL SNAKES GET KILLED BY SNAKES SAID CHUCHUNDRA MORE SORROWFULLY THAN EVER AND HOW AM I TO BE SURE THAT NAG WONT MISTAKE ME FOR YOU SOME DARK NIGHT THERES NOT THE LEAST DANGER SAID RIKKITIKKI BUT NAG IS IN THE GARDEN AND I KNOW YOU DONT GO THERE MY COUSIN CHUA THE RAT TOLD ME SAID CHUCHUNDRA AND THEN HE STOPPED TOLD YOU WHAT HSH NAG IS EVERYWHERE RIKKITIKKI YOU SHOULD HAVE TALKED TO CHUA IN THE GARDEN I DIDNTSO YOU MUST TELL ME QUICK CHUCHUNDRA OR ILL BITE YOU CHUCHUNDRA SAT DOWN AND CRIED TILL THE TEARS ROLLED OFF HIS WHISKERS I AM A VERY POOR MAN HE SOBBED I NEVER HAD SPIRIT ENOUGH TO RUN OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM HSH I MUSTNT TELL YOU ANYTHING CANT YOU HEAR RIKKITIKKI RIKKITIKKI LISTENED THE HOUSE WAS AS STILL AS STILL BUT HE THOUGHT HE COULD JUST CATCH THE FAINTEST SCRATCHSCRATCH IN THE WORLDA NOISE AS FAINT AS THAT OF A WASP WALKING ON A WINDOWPANETHE DRY SCRATCH OF A SNAKES SCALES ON BRICKWORK THATS NAG OR NAGAINA HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND HE IS CRAWLING INTO THE BATHROOM SLUICE YOURE RIGHT CHUCHUNDRA I SHOULD HAVE TALKED TO CHUA HE STOLE OFF TO TEDDYS BATHROOM BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE AND THEN TO TEDDYS MOTHERS BATHROOM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SMOOTH PLASTER WALL THERE WAS A BRICK PULLED OUT TO MAKE A SLUICE FOR THE BATH WATER AND AS RIKKITIKKI STOLE IN BY THE MASONRY CURB WHERE THE BATH IS PUT HE HEARD NAG AND NAGAINA WHISPERING TOGETHER OUTSIDE IN THE MOONLIGHT WHEN THE HOUSE IS EMPTIED OF PEOPLE SAID NAGAINA TO HER HUSBAND HE WILL HAVE TO GO AWAY AND THEN THE GARDEN WILL BE OUR OWN AGAIN GO IN QUIETLY AND REMEMBER THAT THE BIG MAN WHO KILLED KARAIT IS THE FIRST ONE TO BITE THEN COME OUT AND TELL ME AND WE WILL HUNT FOR RIKKITIKKI TOGETHER BUT ARE YOU SURE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING TO BE GAINED BY KILLING THE PEOPLE SAID NAG EVERYTHING WHEN THERE WERE NO PEOPLE IN THE BUNGALOW DID WE HAVE ANY MONGOOSE IN THE GARDEN SO LONG AS THE BUNGALOW IS EMPTY WE ARE KING AND QUEEN OF THE GARDEN AND REMEMBER THAT AS SOON AS OUR EGGS IN THE MELON BED HATCH AS THEY MAY TOMORROW OUR CHILDREN WILL NEED ROOM AND QUIET I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT SAID NAG I WILL GO BUT THERE IS NO NEED THAT WE SHOULD HUNT FOR RIKKITIKKI AFTERWARD I WILL KILL THE BIG MAN AND HIS WIFE AND THE CHILD IF I CAN AND COME AWAY QUIETLY THEN THE BUNGALOW WILL BE EMPTY AND RIKKITIKKI WILL GO RIKKITIKKI TINGLED ALL OVER WITH RAGE AND HATRED AT THIS AND THEN NAGS HEAD CAME THROUGH THE SLUICE AND HIS FIVE FEET OF COLD BODY FOLLOWED IT ANGRY AS HE WAS RIKKITIKKI WAS VERY FRIGHTENED AS HE SAW THE SIZE OF THE BIG COBRA NAG COILED HIMSELF UP RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED INTO THE BATHROOM IN THE DARK AND RIKKI COULD SEE HIS EYES GLITTER NOW IF I KILL HIM HERE NAGAINA WILL KNOW AND IF I FIGHT HIM ON THE OPEN FLOOR THE ODDS ARE IN HIS FAVOR WHAT AM I TO DO SAID RIKKITIKKITAVI NAG WAVED TO AND FRO AND THEN RIKKITIKKI HEARD HIM DRINKING FROM THE BIGGEST WATERJAR THAT WAS USED TO FILL THE BATH THAT IS GOOD SAID THE SNAKE NOW WHEN KARAIT WAS KILLED THE BIG MAN HAD A STICK HE MAY HAVE THAT STICK STILL BUT WHEN HE COMES IN TO BATHE IN THE MORNING HE WILL NOT HAVE A STICK I SHALL WAIT HERE TILL HE COMES NAGAINADO YOU HEAR MEI SHALL WAIT HERE IN THE COOL TILL DAYTIME THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM OUTSIDE SO RIKKITIKKI KNEW NAGAINA HAD GONE AWAY NAG COILED HIMSELF DOWN COIL BY COIL ROUND THE BULGE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER JAR AND RIKKITIKKI STAYED STILL AS DEATH AFTER AN HOUR HE BEGAN TO MOVE MUSCLE BY MUSCLE TOWARD THE JAR NAG WAS ASLEEP AND RIKKITIKKI LOOKED AT HIS BIG BACK WONDERING WHICH WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE FOR A GOOD HOLD IF I DONT BREAK HIS BACK AT THE FIRST JUMP SAID RIKKI HE CAN STILL FIGHT AND IF HE FIGHTSO RIKKI HE LOOKED AT THE THICKNESS OF THE NECK BELOW THE HOOD BUT THAT WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND A BITE NEAR THE TAIL WOULD ONLY MAKE NAG SAVAGE IT MUST BE THE HEAD HE SAID AT LAST THE HEAD ABOVE THE HOOD AND WHEN I AM ONCE THERE I MUST NOT LET GO THEN HE JUMPED THE HEAD WAS LYING A LITTLE CLEAR OF THE WATER JAR UNDER THE CURVE OF IT AND AS HIS TEETH MET RIKKI BRACED HIS BACK AGAINST THE BULGE OF THE RED EARTHENWARE TO HOLD DOWN THE HEAD THIS GAVE HIM JUST ONE SECONDS PURCHASE AND HE MADE THE MOST OF IT THEN HE WAS BATTERED TO AND FRO AS A RAT IS SHAKEN BY A DOGTO AND FRO ON THE FLOOR UP AND DOWN AND AROUND IN GREAT CIRCLES BUT HIS EYES WERE RED AND HE HELD ON AS THE BODY CARTWHIPPED OVER THE FLOOR UPSETTING THE TIN DIPPER AND THE SOAP DISH AND THE FLESH BRUSH AND BANGED AGAINST THE TIN SIDE OF THE BATH AS HE HELD HE CLOSED HIS JAWS TIGHTER AND TIGHTER FOR HE MADE SURE HE WOULD BE BANGED TO DEATH AND FOR THE HONOR OF HIS FAMILY HE PREFERRED TO BE FOUND WITH HIS TEETH LOCKED HE WAS DIZZY ACHING AND FELT SHAKEN TO PIECES WHEN SOMETHING WENT OFF LIKE A THUNDERCLAP JUST BEHIND HIM A HOT WIND KNOCKED HIM SENSELESS AND RED FIRE SINGED HIS FUR THE BIG MAN HAD BEEN WAKENED BY THE NOISE AND HAD FIRED BOTH BARRELS OF A SHOTGUN INTO NAG JUST BEHIND THE HOOD RIKKITIKKI HELD ON WITH HIS EYES SHUT FOR NOW HE WAS QUITE SURE HE WAS DEAD BUT THE HEAD DID NOT MOVE AND THE BIG MAN PICKED HIM UP AND SAID ITS THE MONGOOSE AGAIN ALICE THE LITTLE CHAP HAS SAVED OUR LIVES NOW THEN TEDDYS MOTHER CAME IN WITH A VERY WHITE FACE AND SAW WHAT WAS LEFT OF NAG AND RIKKITIKKI DRAGGED HIMSELF TO TEDDYS BEDROOM AND SPENT HALF THE REST OF THE NIGHT SHAKING HIMSELF TENDERLY TO FIND OUT WHETHER HE REALLY WAS BROKEN INTO FORTY PIECES AS HE FANCIED WHEN MORNING CAME HE WAS VERY STIFF BUT WELL PLEASED WITH HIS DOINGS NOW I HAVE NAGAINA TO SETTLE WITH AND SHE WILL BE WORSE THAN FIVE NAGS AND THERES NO KNOWING WHEN THE EGGS SHE SPOKE OF WILL HATCH GOODNESS I MUST GO AND SEE DARZEE HE SAID WITHOUT WAITING FOR BREAKFAST RIKKITIKKI RAN TO THE THORNBUSH WHERE DARZEE WAS SINGING A SONG OF TRIUMPH AT THE

FODDER AT KALA NAGS SIDE AT LAST THE ELEPHANTS BEGAN TO LIE DOWN ONE AFTER ANOTHER AS IS THEIR CUSTOM TILL ONLY KALA NAG AT THE RIGHT OF THE LINE WAS LEFT STANDING UP AND HE ROCKED SLOWLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE HIS EARS PUT FORWARD TO LISTEN TO THE NIGHT WIND AS IT BLEW VERY SLOWLY ACROSS THE HILLS THE AIR WAS FULL OF ALL THE NIGHT NOISES THAT TAKEN TOGETHER MAKE ONE BIG SILENCETHE CLICK OF ONE BAMBOO STEM AGAINST THE OTHER THE RUSTLE OF SOMETHING ALIVE IN THE UNDERGROWTH THE SCRATCH AND SQUAWK OF A HALFWAKED BIRD BIRDS ARE AWAKE IN THE NIGHT MUCH MORE OFTEN THAN WE IMAGINE AND THE FALL OF WATER EVER SO FAR AWAY LITTLE TOOMAI SLEPT FOR SOME TIME AND WHEN HE WAKED IT WAS BRILLIANT MOONLIGHT AND KALA NAG WAS STILL STANDING UP WITH HIS EARS COCKED LITTLE TOOMAI TURNED RUSTLING IN THE FODDER AND WATCHED THE CURVE OF HIS BIG BACK AGAINST HALF THE STARS IN HEAVEN AND WHILE HE WATCHED HE HEARD SO FAR AWAY THAT IT SOUNDED NO MORE THAN A PINHOLE OF NOISE PRICKED THROUGH THE STILLNESS THE HOOTTOOT OF A WILD ELEPHANT ALL THE ELEPHANTS IN THE LINES JUMPED UP AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SHOT AND THEIR GRUNTS AT LAST WAKED THE SLEEPING MAHOUTS AND THEY CAME OUT AND DROVE IN THE PICKET PEGS WITH BIG MALLETS AND TIGHTENED THIS ROPE AND KNOTTED THAT TILL ALL WAS QUIET ONE NEW ELEPHANT HAD NEARLY GRUBBED UP HIS PICKET AND BIG TOOMAI TOOK OFF KALA NAGS LEG CHAIN AND SHACKLED THAT ELEPHANT FOREFOOT TO HINDFOOT BUT SLIPPED A LOOP OF GRASS STRING ROUND KALA NAGS LEG AND TOLD HIM TO REMEMBER THAT HE WAS TIED FAST HE KNEW THAT HE AND HIS FATHER AND HIS GRANDFATHER HAD DONE THE VERY SAME THING HUNDREDS OF TIMES BEFORE KALA NAG DID NOT ANSWER TO THE ORDER BY GURGLING AS HE USUALLY DID HE STOOD STILL LOOKING OUT ACROSS THE MOONLIGHT HIS HEAD A LITTLE RAISED AND HIS EARS SPREAD LIKE FANS UP TO THE GREAT FOLDS OF THE GARO HILLS TEND TO HIM IF HE GROWS RESTLESS IN THE NIGHT SAID BIG TOOMAI TO LITTLE TOOMAI AND HE WENT INTO THE HUT AND SLEPT LITTLE TOOMAI WAS JUST GOING TO SLEEP TOO WHEN HE HEARD THE COIR STRING SNAP WITH A LITTLE TANG AND KALA NAG ROLLED OUT OF HIS PICKETS AS SLOWLY AND AS SILENTLY AS A CLOUD ROLLS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF A VALLEY LITTLE TOOMAI PATTERED AFTER HIM BAREFOOTED DOWN THE ROAD IN THE MOONLIGHT CALLING UNDER HIS BREATH KALA NAG KALA NAG TAKE ME WITH YOU O KALA NAG THE ELEPHANT TURNED WITHOUT A SOUND TOOK THREE STRIDES BACK TO THE BOY IN THE MOONLIGHT PUT DOWN HIS TRUNK SWUNG HIM UP TO HIS NECK AND ALMOST BEFORE LITTLE TOOMAI HAD SETTLED HIS KNEES SLIPPED INTO THE FOREST THERE WAS ONE BLAST OF FURIOUS TRUMPETING FROM THE LINES AND THEN THE SILENCE SHUT DOWN ON EVERYTHING AND KALA NAG BEGAN TO MOVE SOMETIMES A TUFT OF HIGH GRASS WASHED ALONG HIS SIDES AS A WAVE WASHES ALONG THE SIDES OF A SHIP AND SOMETIMES A CLUSTER OF WILDPEPPER VINES WOULD SCRAPE ALONG HIS BACK OR A BAMBOO WOULD CREAK WHERE HIS SHOULDER TOUCHED IT BUT BETWEEN THOSE TIMES HE MOVED ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT ANY SOUND DRIFTING THROUGH THE THICK GARO FOREST AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SMOKE HE WAS GOING UPHILL BUT THOUGH LITTLE TOOMAI WATCHED THE STARS IN THE RIFTS OF THE TREES HE COULD NOT TELL IN WHAT DIRECTION THEN KALA NAG REACHED THE CREST OF THE ASCENT AND STOPPED FOR A MINUTE AND LITTLE TOOMAI COULD SEE THE TOPS OF THE TREES LYING ALL SPECKLED AND FURRY UNDER THE MOONLIGHT FOR MILES AND MILES AND THE BLUEWHITE MIST OVER THE RIVER IN THE HOLLOW TOOMAI LEANED FORWARD AND LOOKED AND HE FELT THAT THE FOREST WAS AWAKE BELOW HIMAWAKE AND ALIVE AND CROWDED A BIG BROWN FRUITEATING BAT BRUSHED PAST HIS EAR A PORCUPINES QUILLS RATTLED IN THE THICKET AND IN THE DARKNESS BETWEEN THE TREE STEMS HE HEARD A HOGBEAR DIGGING HARD IN THE MOIST WARM EARTH AND SNUFFING AS IT DIGGED THEN THE BRANCHES CLOSED OVER HIS HEAD AGAIN AND KALA NAG BEGAN TO GO DOWN INTO THE VALLEYNOT QUIETLY THIS TIME BUT AS A RUNAWAY GUN GOES DOWN A STEEP BANKIN ONE RUSH THE HUGE LIMBS MOVED AS STEADILY AS PISTONS EIGHT FEET TO EACH STRIDE AND THE WRINKLED SKIN OF THE ELBOW POINTS RUSTLED THE UNDERGROWTH ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM RIPPED WITH A NOISE LIKE TORN CANVAS AND THE SAPLINGS THAT HE HEAVED AWAY RIGHT AND LEFT WITH HIS SHOULDERS SPRANG BACK AGAIN AND BANGED HIM ON THE FLANK AND GREAT TRAILS OF CREEPERS ALL MATTED TOGETHER HUNG FROM HIS TUSKS AS HE THREW HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND PLOWED OUT HIS PATHWAY THEN LITTLE TOOMAI LAID HIMSELF DOWN CLOSE TO THE GREAT NECK LEST A SWINGING BOUGH SHOULD SWEEP HIM TO THE GROUND AND HE WISHED THAT HE WERE BACK IN THE LINES AGAIN THE GRASS BEGAN TO GET SQUASHY AND KALA NAGS FEET SUCKED AND SQUELCHED AS HE PUT THEM DOWN AND THE NIGHT MIST AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY CHILLED LITTLE TOOMAI THERE WAS A SPLASH AND A TRAMPLE AND THE RUSH OF RUNNING WATER AND KALA NAG STRODE THROUGH THE BED OF A RIVER FEELING HIS WAY AT EACH STEP ABOVE THE NOISE OF THE WATER AS IT SWIRLED ROUND THE ELEPHANTS LEGS LITTLE TOOMAI COULD HEAR MORE SPLASHING AND SOME TRUMPETING BOTH UPSTREAM AND DOWNGREAT GRUNTS AND ANGRY SNORTINGS AND ALL THE MIST ABOUT HIM SEEMED TO BE FULL OF ROLLING WAVY SHADOWS AI HE SAID HALF ALOUD HIS TEETH CHATTERING THE ELEPHANTFOLK ARE OUT TONIGHT IT IS THE DANCE THEN KALA NAG SWASHED OUT OF THE WATER BLEW HIS TRUNK CLEAR AND BEGAN ANOTHER CLIMB BUT THIS TIME HE WAS NOT ALONE AND HE HAD NOT TO MAKE HIS PATH THAT WAS MADE ALREADY SIX FEET WIDE IN FRONT OF HIM WHERE THE BENT JUNGLEGRASS WAS TRYING TO RECOVER ITSELF AND STAND UP MANY ELEPHANTS MUST HAVE GONE THAT WAY ONLY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE LITTLE TOOMAI LOOKED BACK AND BEHIND HIM A GREAT WILD TUSKER WITH HIS LITTLE PIGS EYES GLOWING LIKE HOT COALS WAS JUST LIFTING HIMSELF OUT OF THE MISTY RIVER THEN THE TREES CLOSED UP AGAIN AND THEY WENT ON AND UP WITH TRUMPETINGS AND CRASHINGS AND THE SOUND OF BREAKING BRANCHES ON EVERY SIDE OF THEM AT LAST KALA NAG STOOD STILL BETWEEN TWO TREETRUNKS AT THE VERY TOP OF THE HILL THEY WERE PART OF A CIRCLE OF TREES THAT GREW ROUND AN IRREGULAR SPACE OF SOME THREE OR FOUR ACRES AND IN ALL THAT SPACE AS LITTLE TOOMAI COULD SEE THE GROUND HAD BEEN TRAMPLED DOWN AS HARD AS A BRICK FLOOR SOME TREES GREW IN THE CENTER OF THE CLEARING BUT THEIR BARK WAS RUBBED AWAY AND THE WHITE WOOD BENEATH SHOWED ALL SHINY AND POLISHED IN THE PATCHES OF MOONLIGHT THERE WERE CREEPERS HANGING FROM THE UPPER BRANCHES AND THE BELLS OF THE FLOWERS OF THE CREEPERS GREAT WAXY WHITE THINGS LIKE CONVOLVULUSES HUNG DOWN FAST ASLEEP BUT WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CLEARING THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE BLADE OF GREENNOTHING BUT THE TRAMPLED EARTH THE MOONLIGHT SHOWED IT ALL IRON GRAY EXCEPT WHERE SOME ELEPHANTS STOOD UPON IT AND THEIR SHADOWS WERE INKY BLACK LITTLE TOOMAI LOOKED HOLDING HIS BREATH WITH HIS EYES STARTING OUT OF HIS HEAD AND AS HE LOOKED MORE AND MORE AND MORE ELEPHANTS SWUNG OUT INTO THE OPEN FROM BETWEEN THE TREE TRUNKS LITTLE TOOMAI COULD ONLY COUNT UP TO TEN AND HE COUNTED AGAIN AND AGAIN ON HIS FINGERS TILL HE LOST COUNT OF THE TENS AND HIS HEAD BEGAN TO SWIM OUTSIDE THE CLEARING HE COULD HEAR THEM CRASHING IN THE UNDERGROWTH AS THEY WORKED THEIR WAY UP THE HILLSIDE BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF THE TREE TRUNKS THEY MOVED LIKE GHOSTS THERE WERE WHITETUSKED WILD MALES WITH FALLEN LEAVES AND NUTS AND TWIGS LYING IN THE WRINKLES OF THEIR NECKS AND THE FOLDS OF THEIR EARS FAT SLOWFOOTED SHEELEPHANTS WITH RESTLESS LITTLE PINKY BLACK CALVES ONLY THREE OR FOUR FEET HIGH RUNNING UNDER THEIR STOMACHS YOUNG ELEPHANTS WITH THEIR TUSKS JUST BEGINNING TO SHOW AND VERY PROUD OF THEM LANKY SCRAGGY OLDMAID ELEPHANTS WITH THEIR HOLLOW ANXIOUS FACES AND TRUNKS LIKE ROUGH BARK SAVAGE OLD BULL ELEPHANTS SCARRED FROM SHOULDER TO FLANK WITH GREAT WEALS AND CUTS OF BYGONE FIGHTS AND THE CAKED DIRT OF THEIR SOLITARY MUD BATHS DROPPING FROM THEIR SHOULDERS AND THERE WAS ONE WITH A BROKEN TUSK AND THE MARKS OF THE FULLSTROKE THE TERRIBLE DRAWING SCRAPE OF A TIGERS CLAWS ON HIS SIDE THEY WERE STANDING HEAD TO HEAD OR WALKING TO AND FRO ACROSS THE GROUND IN COUPLES OR ROCKING AND SWAYING ALL BY THEMSELVESSCORES AND SCORES OF ELEPHANTS TOOMAI KNEW THAT SO LONG AS HE LAY STILL ON KALA NAGS NECK NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM FOR EVEN IN THE RUSH AND SCRAMBLE OF A KEDDAH DRIVE A WILD ELEPHANT DOES NOT REACH UP WITH HIS TRUNK AND DRAG A MAN OFF THE NECK OF A TAME ELEPHANT AND THESE ELEPHANTS WERE NOT THINKING OF MEN THAT NIGHT ONCE THEY STARTED AND PUT THEIR EARS FORWARD WHEN THEY HEARD THE CHINKING OF A LEG IRON IN THE FOREST BUT IT WAS PUDMINI PETERSEN SAHIBS PET ELEPHANT HER CHAIN SNAPPED SHORT OFF GRUNTING SNUFFLING UP THE HILLSIDE SHE MUST HAVE BROKEN HER PICKETS AND COME STRAIGHT FROM PETERSEN SAHIBS CAMP AND LITTLE TOOMAI SAW ANOTHER ELEPHANT ONE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WITH DEEP ROPE GALLS ON HIS BACK AND BREAST HE TOO MUST HAVE RUN AWAY FROM SOME CAMP IN THE HILLS ABOUT AT LAST THERE WAS NO SOUND OF ANY MORE ELEPHANTS MOVING IN THE FOREST AND KALA NAG ROLLED OUT FROM HIS STATION BETWEEN THE TREES AND WENT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD CLUCKING AND GURGLING AND ALL THE ELEPHANTS BEGAN TO TALK IN THEIR OWN TONGUE AND TO MOVE ABOUT STILL LYING DOWN LITTLE TOOMAI LOOKED DOWN UPON SCORES AND SCORES OF BROAD BACKS AND WAGGING EARS AND TOSSING TRUNKS AND LITTLE ROLLING EYES HE HEARD THE CLICK OF TUSKS AS THEY CROSSED OTHER TUSKS BY ACCIDENT AND THE DRY RUSTLE OF TRUNKS TWINED TOGETHER AND THE CHAFING OF ENORMOUS SIDES AND SHOULDERS IN THE CROWD AND THE INCESSANT FLICK AND HISSH OF THE GREAT TAILS THEN A CLOUD CAME OVER THE MOON AND HE SAT IN BLACK DARKNESS BUT THE QUIET STEADY HUSTLING AND PUSHING AND GURGLING WENT ON JUST THE SAME HE KNEW THAT THERE WERE ELEPHANTS ALL ROUND KALA NAG AND THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF BACKING HIM OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY SO HE SET HIS TEETH AND SHIVERED IN A KEDDAH AT LEAST THERE WAS TORCHLIGHT AND SHOUTING BUT HERE HE WAS ALL ALONE IN THE DARK AND ONCE A TRUNK CAME UP AND TOUCHED HIM ON THE KNEE THEN AN ELEPHANT TRUMPETED AND THEY ALL TOOK IT UP FOR FIVE OR TEN TERRIBLE SECONDS THE DEW FROM THE TREES ABOVE SPATTERED DOWN LIKE RAIN ON THE UNSEEN BACKS AND A DULL BOOMING NOISE BEGAN NOT VERY LOUD AT FIRST AND LITTLE TOOMAI COULD NOT TELL WHAT IT WAS BUT IT GREW AND GREW AND KALA NAG LIFTED UP ONE FOREFOOT AND THEN THE OTHER AND BROUGHT THEM DOWN ON THE GROUNDONETWO ONETWO AS STEADILY AS TRIPHAMMERS THE ELEPHANTS WERE STAMPING ALL TOGETHER NOW AND IT SOUNDED LIKE A WAR DRUM BEATEN AT THE MOUTH OF A CAVE THE DEW FELL FROM THE TREES TILL THERE WAS NO MORE LEFT TO FALL AND THE BOOMING WENT ON AND THE GROUND ROCKED AND SHIVERED AND LITTLE TOOMAI PUT HIS HANDS UP TO HIS EARS TO SHUT OUT THE SOUND BUT IT WAS ALL ONE GIGANTIC JAR THAT RAN THROUGH HIMTHIS STAMP OF HUNDREDS OF HEAVY FEET ON THE RAW EARTH ONCE OR TWICE HE COULD FEEL KALA NAG AND ALL THE OTHERS SURGE FORWARD A FEW STRIDES AND THE THUMPING WOULD CHANGE TO THE CRUSHING SOUND OF JUICY GREEN THINGS BEING BRUISED BUT IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE BOOM OF FEET ON HARD EARTH BEGAN AGAIN A TREE WAS CREAKING AND GROANING SOMEWHERE NEAR HIM HE PUT OUT HIS ARM AND FELT THE BARK BUT KALA NAG MOVED FORWARD STILL TRAMPING AND HE COULD NOT TELL WHERE HE WAS IN THE CLEARING THERE WAS NO SOUND FROM THE ELEPHANTS EXCEPT ONCE WHEN TWO OR THREE LITTLE CALVES SQUEAKED TOGETHER THEN HE HEARD A THUMP AND A SHUFFLE AND THE BOOMING WENT ON IT MUST HAVE LASTED FULLY TWO HOURS AND LITTLE TOOMAI ACHED IN EVERY NERVE BUT HE KNEW BY THE SMELL OF THE NIGHT AIR THAT THE DAWN WAS COMING THE MORNING BROKE IN ONE SHEET OF PALE YELLOW BEHIND THE GREEN HILLS AND THE BOOMING STOPPED WITH THE FIRST RAY AS THOUGH THE LIGHT HAD BEEN AN ORDER BEFORE LITTLE TOOMAI HAD GOT THE RINGING OUT OF HIS HEAD BEFORE EVEN HE HAD SHIFTED HIS POSITION THERE WAS NOT AN ELEPHANT IN SIGHT EXCEPT KALA NAG PUDMINI AND THE ELEPHANT WITH THE ROPEGALLS AND THERE WAS NEITHER SIGN NOR RUSTLE NOR WHISPER DOWN THE HILLSIDES TO SHOW WHERE THE OTHERS HAD GONE LITTLE TOOMAI STARED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE CLEARING AS HE REMEMBERED IT HAD GROWN IN THE NIGHT MORE TREES STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF IT BUT THE UNDERGROWTH AND THE JUNGLE GRASS AT THE SIDES HAD BEEN ROLLED BACK LITTLE TOOMAI STARED ONCE MORE NOW HE UNDERSTOOD THE TRAMPLING THE ELEPHANTS HAD STAMPED OUT MORE ROOMHAD STAMPED THE THICK GRASS AND JUICY CANE TO TRASH THE TRASH INTO SLIVERS THE SLIVERS INTO TINY FIBERS AND THE FIBERS INTO HARD EARTH WAH SAID LITTLE TOOMAI AND HIS EYES WERE VERY HEAVY KALA NAG MY LORD LET US KEEP BY PUDMINI AND GO TO PETERSEN SAHIBS CAMP OR I SHALL DROP FROM THY NECK THE THIRD ELEPHANT WATCHED THE TWO GO AWAY SNORTED WHEELED ROUND AND TOOK HIS OWN PATH HE MAY HAVE BELONGED TO SOME LITTLE NATIVE KINGS ESTABLISHMENT FIFTY OR SIXTY OR A HUNDRED MILES AWAY TWO HOURS LATER AS PETERSEN SAHIB WAS EATING EARLY BREAKFAST HIS ELEPHANTS WHO HAD BEEN DOUBLE CHAINED THAT NIGHT BEGAN TO TRUMPET AND PUDMINI MIRED TO THE SHOULDERS WITH KALA NAG VERY FOOTSORE SHAMBLED INTO THE CAMP LITTLE TOOMAIS FACE WAS GRAY AND PINCHED AND HIS HAIR WAS FULL OF LEAVES AND DRENCHED WITH DEW BUT HE TRIED TO SALUTE PETERSEN SAHIB AND CRIED FAINTLY THE DANCETHE ELEPHANT DANCE I HAVE SEEN IT ANDI DIE AS KALA NAG SAT DOWN HE SLID OFF HIS NECK IN A DEAD FAINT BUT SINCE NATIVE CHILDREN HAVE NO NERVES WORTH SPEAKING OF IN TWO HOURS HE WAS LYING VERY CONTENTEDLY IN PETERSEN SAHIBS HAMMOCK WITH PETERSEN SAHIBS SHOOTINGCOAT UNDER HIS HEAD AND A GLASS OF WARM MILK A LITTLE BRANDY WITH A DASH OF QUININE INSIDE OF HIM AND WHILE THE OLD HAIRY SCARRED HUNTERS OF THE JUNGLES SAT THREE DEEP BEFORE HIM LOOKING AT HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE A SPIRIT HE TOLD HIS TALE IN SHORT WORDS AS A CHILD WILL AND WOUND UP WITH NOW IF I LIE IN ONE WORD SEND MEN TO SEE AND THEY WILL FIND THAT THE ELEPHANT FOLK HAVE TRAMPLED DOWN MORE ROOM IN THEIR DANCEROOM AND THEY WILL FIND TEN AND TEN AND MANY TIMES TEN TRACKS LEADING TO THAT DANCEROOM THEY MADE MORE ROOM WITH THEIR FEET I HAVE SEEN IT KALA NAG TOOK ME AND I SAW ALSO KALA NAG IS VERY LEGWEARY LITTLE TOOMAI LAY BACK AND SLEPT ALL THROUGH THE LONG AFTERNOON AND INTO THE TWILIGHT AND WHILE HE SLEPT PETERSEN SAHIB AND MACHUA APPA FOLLOWED THE TRACK OF THE TWO ELEPHANTS FOR FIFTEEN MILES ACROSS THE HILLS PETERSEN SAHIB HAD SPENT EIGHTEEN YEARS IN CATCHING ELEPHANTS AND HE HAD ONLY ONCE BEFORE FOUND SUCH A DANCEPLACE MACHUA APPA HAD NO NEED TO LOOK TWICE AT THE CLEARING TO SEE WHAT HAD BEEN DONE THERE OR TO SCRATCH WITH HIS TOE IN THE PACKED RAMMED EARTH THE CHILD SPEAKS TRUTH SAID HE ALL THIS WAS DONE LAST NIGHT AND I HAVE COUNTED SEVENTY TRACKS CROSSING THE RIVER SEE SAHIB WHERE PUDMINIS LEGIRON CUT THE BARK OF THAT TREE YES SHE WAS THERE TOO THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND UP AND DOWN AND THEY WONDERED FOR THE WAYS OF ELEPHANTS ARE BEYOND THE WIT OF ANY MAN BLACK OR WHITE TO FATHOM FORTY YEARS AND FIVE SAID MACHUA APPA HAVE I FOLLOWED MY LORD THE ELEPHANT BUT NEVER HAVE I HEARD THAT ANY CHILD OF MAN HAD SEEN WHAT THIS CHILD HAS SEEN BY ALL THE GODS OF THE HILLS IT ISWHAT CAN WE SAY AND HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WHEN THEY GOT BACK TO CAMP IT WAS TIME FOR THE EVENING MEAL PETERSEN SAHIB ATE ALONE IN HIS TENT BUT HE GAVE ORDERS THAT THE CAMP SHOULD HAVE TWO SHEEP AND SOME FOWLS AS WELL AS A DOUBLE RATION OF FLOUR AND RICE AND SALT FOR HE KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE A FEAST BIG TOOMAI HAD COME UP HOTFOOT FROM THE CAMP IN THE PLAINS TO SEARCH FOR HIS SON AND HIS ELEPHANT AND NOW THAT HE HAD FOUND THEM HE LOOKED AT THEM AS THOUGH HE WERE AFRAID OF THEM BOTH AND THERE WAS A FEAST BY THE BLAZING CAMPFIRES IN FRONT OF THE LINES OF PICKETED ELEPHANTS AND LITTLE TOOMAI WAS THE HERO OF IT ALL AND THE BIG BROWN ELEPHANT CATCHERS THE TRACKERS AND DRIVERS AND ROPERS AND THE MEN WHO KNOW ALL THE SECRETS OF BREAKING THE WILDEST ELEPHANTS PASSED HIM FROM ONE TO THE OTHER AND THEY MARKED HIS FOREHEAD WITH BLOOD FROM THE BREAST OF A NEWLY KILLED JUNGLECOCK TO SHOW THAT HE WAS A FORESTER INITIATED AND FREE OF ALL THE JUNGLES AND AT LAST WHEN THE FLAMES DIED DOWN AND THE RED LIGHT OF THE LOGS MADE THE ELEPHANTS LOOK AS THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN DIPPED IN BLOOD TOO MACHUA APPA THE HEAD OF
