GENIAL SUN AND SHOWERS THAT HAVE FALLEN ON THESE LEAVES OF DAVID COPPERFIELD AND MADE ME HAPPY LONDON OCTOBER PREFACE TO THE CHARLES DICKENS EDITION I REMARKED IN THE ORIGINAL PREFACE TO THIS BOOK THAT I DID NOT FIND IT EASY TO GET SUFFICIENTLY FAR AWAY FROM IT IN THE FIRST SENSATIONS OF HAVING FINISHED IT TO REFER TO IT WITH THE COMPOSURE WHICH THIS FORMAL HEADING WOULD SEEM TO REQUIRE MY INTEREST IN IT WAS SO RECENT AND STRONG AND MY MIND WAS SO DIVIDED BETWEEN PLEASURE AND REGRETPLEASURE IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A LONG DESIGN REGRET IN THE SEPARATION FROM MANY COMPANIONSTHAT I WAS IN DANGER OF WEARYING THE READER WITH PERSONAL CONFIDENCES AND PRIVATE EMOTIONS BESIDES WHICH ALL THAT I COULD HAVE SAID OF THE STORY TO ANY PURPOSE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO SAY IN IT IT WOULD CONCERN THE READER LITTLE PERHAPS TO KNOW HOW SORROWFULLY THE PEN IS LAID DOWN AT THE CLOSE OF A TWOYEARS IMAGINATIVE TASK OR HOW AN AUTHOR FEELS AS IF HE WERE DISMISSING SOME PORTION OF HIMSELF INTO THE SHADOWY WORLD WHEN A CROWD OF THE CREATURES OF HIS BRAIN ARE GOING FROM HIM FOR EVER YET I HAD NOTHING ELSE TO TELL UNLESS INDEED I WERE TO CONFESS WHICH MIGHT BE OF LESS MOMENT STILL THAT NO ONE CAN EVER BELIEVE THIS NARRATIVE IN THE READING MORE THAN I BELIEVED IT IN THE WRITING SO TRUE ARE THESE AVOWALS AT THE PRESENT DAY THAT I CAN NOW ONLY TAKE THE READER INTO ONE CONFIDENCE MORE OF ALL MY BOOKS I LIKE THIS THE BEST IT WILL BE EASILY BELIEVED THAT I AM A FOND PARENT TO EVERY CHILD OF MY FANCY AND THAT NO ONE CAN EVER LOVE THAT FAMILY AS DEARLY AS I LOVE THEM BUT LIKE MANY FOND PARENTS I HAVE IN MY HEART OF HEARTS A FAVOURITE CHILD AND HIS NAME IS DAVID COPPERFIELD THE PERSONAL HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE OF DAVID COPPERFIELD THE YOUNGER CHAPTER I AM BORN WHETHER I SHALL TURN OUT TO BE THE HERO OF MY OWN LIFE OR WHETHER THAT STATION WILL BE HELD BY ANYBODY ELSE THESE PAGES MUST SHOW TO BEGIN MY LIFE WITH THE BEGINNING OF MY LIFE I RECORD THAT I WAS BORN AS I HAVE BEEN INFORMED AND BELIEVE ON A FRIDAY AT TWELVE OCLOCK AT NIGHT IT WAS REMARKED THAT THE CLOCK BEGAN TO STRIKE AND I BEGAN TO CRY SIMULTANEOUSLY IN CONSIDERATION OF THE DAY AND HOUR OF MY BIRTH IT WAS DECLARED BY THE NURSE AND BY SOME SAGE WOMEN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WHO HAD TAKEN A LIVELY INTEREST IN ME SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF OUR BECOMING PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED FIRST THAT I WAS DESTINED TO BE UNLUCKY IN LIFE AND SECONDLY THAT I WAS PRIVILEGED TO SEE GHOSTS AND SPIRITS BOTH THESE GIFTS INEVITABLY ATTACHING AS THEY BELIEVED TO ALL UNLUCKY INFANTS OF EITHER GENDER BORN TOWARDS THE SMALL HOURS ON A FRIDAY NIGHT I NEED SAY NOTHING HERE ON THE FIRST HEAD BECAUSE NOTHING CAN SHOW BETTER THAN MY HISTORY WHETHER THAT PREDICTION WAS VERIFIED OR FALSIFIED BY THE RESULT ON THE SECOND BRANCH OF THE QUESTION I WILL ONLY REMARK THAT UNLESS I RAN THROUGH THAT PART OF MY INHERITANCE WHILE I WAS STILL A BABY I HAVE NOT COME INTO IT YET BUT I DO NOT AT ALL COMPLAIN OF HAVING BEEN KEPT OUT OF THIS PROPERTY AND IF ANYBODY ELSE SHOULD BE IN THE PRESENT ENJOYMENT OF IT HE IS HEARTILY WELCOME TO KEEP IT I WAS BORN WITH A CAUL WHICH WAS ADVERTISED FOR SALE IN THE NEWSPAPERS AT THE LOW PRICE OF FIFTEEN GUINEAS WHETHER SEAGOING PEOPLE WERE SHORT OF MONEY ABOUT THAT TIME OR WERE SHORT OF FAITH AND PREFERRED CORK JACKETS I DONT KNOW ALL I KNOW IS THAT THERE WAS BUT ONE SOLITARY BIDDING AND THAT WAS FROM AN ATTORNEY CONNECTED WITH THE BILLBROKING BUSINESS WHO OFFERED TWO POUNDS IN CASH AND THE BALANCE IN SHERRY BUT DECLINED TO BE GUARANTEED FROM DROWNING ON ANY HIGHER BARGAIN CONSEQUENTLY THE ADVERTISEMENT WAS WITHDRAWN AT A DEAD LOSSFOR AS TO SHERRY MY POOR DEAR MOTHERS OWN SHERRY WAS IN THE MARKET THENAND TEN YEARS AFTERWARDS THE CAUL WAS PUT UP IN A RAFFLE DOWN IN OUR PART OF THE COUNTRY TO FIFTY MEMBERS AT HALFACROWN A HEAD THE WINNER TO SPEND FIVE SHILLINGS I WAS PRESENT MYSELF AND I REMEMBER TO HAVE FELT QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE AND CONFUSED AT A PART OF MYSELF BEING DISPOSED OF IN THAT WAY THE CAUL WAS WON I RECOLLECT BY AN OLD LADY WITH A HANDBASKET WHO VERY RELUCTANTLY PRODUCED FROM IT THE STIPULATED FIVE SHILLINGS ALL IN HALFPENCE AND TWOPENCE HALFPENNY SHORTAS IT TOOK AN IMMENSE TIME AND A GREAT WASTE OF ARITHMETIC TO ENDEAVOUR WITHOUT ANY EFFECT TO PROVE TO HER IT IS A FACT WHICH WILL BE LONG REMEMBERED AS REMARKABLE DOWN THERE THAT SHE WAS NEVER DROWNED BUT DIED TRIUMPHANTLY IN BED AT NINETYTWO I HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS TO THE LAST HER PROUDEST BOAST THAT SHE NEVER HAD BEEN ON THE WATER IN HER LIFE EXCEPT UPON A BRIDGE AND THAT OVER HER TEA TO WHICH SHE WAS EXTREMELY PARTIAL SHE TO THE LAST EXPRESSED HER INDIGNATION AT THE IMPIETY OF MARINERS AND OTHERS WHO HAD THE PRESUMPTION TO GO MEANDERING ABOUT THE WORLD IT WAS IN VAIN TO REPRESENT TO HER THAT SOME CONVENIENCES TEA PERHAPS INCLUDED RESULTED FROM THIS OBJECTIONABLE PRACTICE SHE ALWAYS RETURNED WITH GREATER EMPHASIS AND WITH AN INSTINCTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRENGTH OF HER OBJECTION LET US HAVE NO MEANDERING NOT TO MEANDER MYSELF AT PRESENT I WILL GO BACK TO MY BIRTH I WAS BORN AT BLUNDERSTONE IN SUFFOLK OR THERE BY AS THEY SAY IN SCOTLAND I WAS A POSTHUMOUS CHILD MY FATHERS EYES HAD CLOSED UPON THE LIGHT OF THIS WORLD SIX MONTHS WHEN MINE OPENED ON IT THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE TO ME EVEN NOW IN THE REFLECTION THAT HE NEVER SAW ME AND SOMETHING STRANGER YET IN THE SHADOWY REMEMBRANCE THAT I HAVE OF MY FIRST CHILDISH ASSOCIATIONS WITH HIS WHITE GRAVESTONE IN THE CHURCHYARD AND OF THE INDEFINABLE COMPASSION I USED TO FEEL FOR IT LYING OUT ALONE THERE IN THE DARK NIGHT WHEN OUR LITTLE PARLOUR WAS WARM AND BRIGHT WITH FIRE AND CANDLE AND THE DOORS OF OUR HOUSE WEREALMOST CRUELLY IT SEEMED TO ME SOMETIMESBOLTED AND LOCKED AGAINST IT AN AUNT OF MY FATHERS AND CONSEQUENTLY A GREATAUNT OF MINE OF WHOM I SHALL HAVE MORE TO RELATE BY AND BY WAS THE PRINCIPAL MAGNATE OF OUR FAMILY MISS TROTWOOD OR MISS BETSEY AS MY POOR MOTHER ALWAYS CALLED HER WHEN SHE SUFFICIENTLY OVERCAME HER DREAD OF THIS FORMIDABLE PERSONAGE TO MENTION HER AT ALL WHICH WAS SELDOM HAD BEEN MARRIED TO A HUSBAND YOUNGER THAN HERSELF WHO WAS VERY HANDSOME EXCEPT IN THE SENSE OF THE HOMELY ADAGE HANDSOME IS THAT HANDSOME DOESFOR HE WAS STRONGLY SUSPECTED OF HAVING BEATEN MISS BETSEY AND EVEN OF HAVING ONCE ON A DISPUTED QUESTION OF SUPPLIES MADE SOME HASTY BUT DETERMINED ARRANGEMENTS TO THROW HER OUT OF A TWO PAIR OF STAIRS WINDOW THESE EVIDENCES OF AN INCOMPATIBILITY OF TEMPER INDUCED MISS BETSEY TO PAY HIM OFF AND EFFECT A SEPARATION BY MUTUAL CONSENT HE WENT TO INDIA WITH HIS CAPITAL AND THERE ACCORDING TO A WILD LEGEND IN OUR FAMILY HE WAS ONCE SEEN RIDING ON AN ELEPHANT IN COMPANY WITH A BABOON BUT I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A BABOOOR A BEGUM ANYHOW FROM INDIA TIDINGS OF HIS DEATH REACHED HOME WITHIN TEN YEARS HOW THEY AFFECTED MY AUNT NOBODY KNEW FOR IMMEDIATELY UPON THE SEPARATION SHE TOOK HER MAIDEN NAME AGAIN BOUGHT A COTTAGE IN A HAMLET ON THE SEACOAST A LONG WAY OFF ESTABLISHED HERSELF THERE AS A SINGLE WOMAN WITH ONE SERVANT AND WAS UNDERSTOOD TO LIVE SECLUDED EVER AFTERWARDS IN AN INFLEXIBLE RETIREMENT MY FATHER HAD ONCE BEEN A FAVOURITE OF HERS I BELIEVE BUT SHE WAS MORTALLY AFFRONTED BY HIS MARRIAGE ON THE GROUND THAT MY MOTHER WAS A WAX DOLL SHE HAD NEVER SEEN MY MOTHER BUT SHE KNEW HER TO BE NOT YET TWENTY MY FATHER AND MISS BETSEY NEVER MET AGAIN HE WAS DOUBLE MY MOTHERS AGE WHEN HE MARRIED AND OF BUT A DELICATE CONSTITUTION HE DIED A YEAR AFTERWARDS AND AS I HAVE SAID SIX MONTHS BEFORE I CAME INTO THE WORLD THIS WAS THE STATE OF MATTERS ON THE AFTERNOON OF WHAT I MAY BE EXCUSED FOR CALLING THAT EVENTFUL AND IMPORTANT FRIDAY I CAN MAKE NO CLAIM THEREFORE TO HAVE KNOWN AT THAT TIME HOW MATTERS STOOD OR TO HAVE ANY REMEMBRANCE FOUNDED ON THE EVIDENCE OF MY OWN SENSES OF WHAT FOLLOWS MY MOTHER WAS SITTING BY THE FIRE BUT POORLY IN HEALTH AND VERY LOW IN SPIRITS LOOKING AT IT THROUGH HER TEARS AND DESPONDING HEAVILY ABOUT HERSELF AND THE FATHERLESS LITTLE STRANGER WHO WAS ALREADY WELCOMED BY SOME GROSSES OF PROPHETIC PINS IN A DRAWER UPSTAIRS TO A WORLD NOT AT ALL EXCITED ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS ARRIVAL MY MOTHER I SAY WAS SITTING BY THE FIRE THAT BRIGHT WINDY MARCH AFTERNOON VERY TIMID AND SAD AND VERY DOUBTFUL OF EVER COMING ALIVE OUT OF THE TRIAL THAT WAS BEFORE HER WHEN LIFTING HER EYES AS SHE DRIED THEM TO THE WINDOW OPPOSITE SHE SAW A STRANGE LADY COMING UP THE GARDEN MY MOTHER HAD A SURE FOREBODING AT THE SECOND GLANCE THAT IT WAS MISS BETSEY THE SETTING SUN WAS GLOWING ON THE STRANGE LADY OVER THE GARDENFENCE AND SHE CAME WALKING UP TO THE DOOR WITH A FELL RIGIDITY OF FIGURE AND COMPOSURE OF COUNTENANCE THAT COULD HAVE BELONGED TO NOBODY ELSE WHEN SHE REACHED THE HOUSE SHE GAVE ANOTHER PROOF OF HER IDENTITY MY FATHER HAD OFTEN HINTED THAT SHE SELDOM CONDUCTED HERSELF LIKE ANY ORDINARY CHRISTIAN AND NOW INSTEAD OF RINGING THE BELL SHE CAME AND LOOKED IN AT THAT IDENTICAL WINDOW PRESSING THE END OF HER NOSE AGAINST THE GLASS TO THAT EXTENT THAT MY POOR DEAR MOTHER USED TO SAY IT BECAME PERFECTLY FLAT AND WHITE IN A MOMENT SHE GAVE MY MOTHER SUCH A TURN THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONVINCED I AM INDEBTED TO MISS BETSEY FOR HAVING BEEN BORN ON A FRIDAY MY MOTHER HAD LEFT HER CHAIR IN HER AGITATION AND GONE BEHIND IT IN THE CORNER MISS BETSEY LOOKING ROUND THE ROOM SLOWLY AND INQUIRINGLY BEGAN ON THE OTHER SIDE AND CARRIED HER EYES ON LIKE A SARACENS HEAD IN A DUTCH CLOCK UNTIL THEY REACHED MY MOTHER THEN SHE MADE A FROWN AND A GESTURE TO MY MOTHER LIKE ONE WHO WAS ACCUSTOMED TO BE OBEYED TO COME AND OPEN THE DOOR MY MOTHER WENT MRS DAVID COPPERFIELD I THINK SAID MISS BETSEY THE EMPHASIS REFERRING PERHAPS TO MY MOTHERS MOURNING WEEDS AND HER CONDITION YES SAID MY MOTHER FAINTLY MISS TROTWOOD SAID THE VISITOR YOU HAVE HEARD OF HER I DARE SAY MY MOTHER ANSWERED SHE HAD HAD THAT PLEASURE AND SHE HAD A DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS OF NOT APPEARING TO IMPLY THAT IT HAD BEEN AN OVERPOWERING PLEASURE NOW YOU SEE HER SAID MISS BETSEY MY MOTHER BENT HER HEAD AND BEGGED HER TO WALK IN THEY WENT INTO THE PARLOUR MY MOTHER HAD COME FROM THE FIRE IN THE BEST ROOM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PASSAGE NOT BEING LIGHTEDNOT HAVING BEEN LIGHTED INDEED SINCE MY FATHERS FUNERAL AND WHEN THEY WERE BOTH SEATED AND MISS BETSEY SAID NOTHING MY MOTHER AFTER VAINLY TRYING TO RESTRAIN HERSELF BEGAN TO CRY OH TUT TUT TUT SAID MISS BETSEY IN A HURRY DONT DO THAT COME COME MY MOTHER COULDNT HELP IT NOTWITHSTANDING SO SHE CRIED UNTIL SHE HAD HAD HER CRY OUT TAKE OFF YOUR CAP CHILD SAID MISS BETSEY AND LET ME SEE YOU MY MOTHER WAS TOO MUCH AFRAID OF HER TO REFUSE COMPLIANCE WITH THIS ODD REQUEST IF SHE HAD ANY DISPOSITION TO DO SO THEREFORE SHE DID AS SHE WAS TOLD AND DID IT WITH SUCH NERVOUS HANDS THAT HER HAIR WHICH WAS LUXURIANT AND BEAUTIFUL FELL ALL ABOUT HER FACE WHY BLESS MY HEART EXCLAIMED MISS BETSEY YOU ARE A VERY BABY MY MOTHER WAS NO DOUBT UNUSUALLY YOUTHFUL IN APPEARANCE EVEN FOR HER YEARS SHE HUNG HER HEAD AS IF IT WERE HER FAULT POOR THING AND SAID SOBBING THAT INDEED SHE WAS AFRAID SHE WAS BUT A CHILDISH WIDOW AND WOULD BE BUT A CHILDISH MOTHER IF SHE LIVED IN A SHORT PAUSE WHICH ENSUED SHE HAD A FANCY THAT SHE FELT MISS BETSEY TOUCH HER HAIR AND THAT WITH NO UNGENTLE HAND BUT LOOKING AT HER IN HER TIMID HOPE SHE FOUND THAT LADY SITTING WITH THE SKIRT OF HER DRESS TUCKED UP HER HANDS FOLDED ON ONE KNEE AND HER FEET UPON THE FENDER FROWNING AT THE FIRE IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN SAID MISS BETSEY SUDDENLY WHY ROOKERY DO YOU MEAN THE HOUSE MAAM ASKED MY MOTHER WHY ROOKERY SAID MISS BETSEY COOKERY WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THE PURPOSE IF YOU HAD HAD ANY PRACTICAL IDEAS OF LIFE EITHER OF YOU THE NAME WAS MR COPPERFIELDS CHOICE RETURNED MY MOTHER WHEN HE BOUGHT THE HOUSE HE LIKED TO THINK THAT THERE WERE ROOKS ABOUT IT THE EVENING WIND MADE SUCH A DISTURBANCE JUST NOW AMONG SOME TALL OLD ELMTREES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN THAT NEITHER MY MOTHER NOR MISS BETSEY COULD FORBEAR GLANCING THAT WAY AS THE ELMS BENT TO ONE ANOTHER LIKE GIANTS WHO WERE WHISPERING SECRETS AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS OF SUCH REPOSE FELL INTO A VIOLENT FLURRY TOSSING THEIR WILD ARMS ABOUT AS IF THEIR LATE CONFIDENCES WERE REALLY TOO WICKED FOR THEIR PEACE OF MIND SOME WEATHERBEATEN RAGGED OLD ROOKSNESTS BURDENING THEIR HIGHER BRANCHES SWUNG LIKE WRECKS UPON A STORMY SEA WHERE ARE THE BIRDS ASKED MISS BETSEY THE MY MOTHER HAD BEEN THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE THE ROOKSWHAT HAS BECOME OF THEM ASKED MISS BETSEY THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY SINCE WE HAVE LIVED HERE SAID MY MOTHER WE THOUGHTMR COPPERFIELD THOUGHTIT WAS QUITE A LARGE ROOKERY BUT THE NESTS WERE VERY OLD ONES AND THE BIRDS HAVE DESERTED THEM A LONG WHILE DAVID COPPERFIELD ALL OVER CRIED MISS BETSEY DAVID COPPERFIELD FROM HEAD TO FOOT CALLS A HOUSE A ROOKERY WHEN THERES NOT A ROOK NEAR IT AND TAKES THE BIRDS ON TRUST BECAUSE HE SEES THE NESTS MR COPPERFIELD RETURNED MY MOTHER IS DEAD AND IF YOU DARE TO SPEAK UNKINDLY OF HIM TO ME MY POOR DEAR MOTHER I SUPPOSE HAD SOME MOMENTARY INTENTION OF COMMITTING AN ASSAULT AND BATTERY UPON MY AUNT WHO COULD EASILY HAVE SETTLED HER WITH ONE HAND EVEN IF MY MOTHER HAD BEEN IN FAR BETTER TRAINING FOR SUCH AN ENCOUNTER THAN SHE WAS THAT EVENING BUT IT PASSED WITH THE ACTION OF RISING FROM HER CHAIR AND SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN VERY MEEKLY AND FAINTED WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF OR WHEN MISS BETSEY HAD RESTORED HER WHICHEVER IT WAS SHE FOUND THE LATTER STANDING AT THE WINDOW THE TWILIGHT WAS BY THIS TIME SHADING DOWN INTO DARKNESS AND DIMLY AS THEY SAW EACH OTHER THEY COULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT WITHOUT THE AID OF THE FIRE WELL SAID MISS BETSEY COMING BACK TO HER CHAIR AS IF SHE HAD ONLY BEEN TAKING A CASUAL LOOK AT THE PROSPECT AND WHEN DO YOU EXPECT I AM ALL IN A TREMBLE FALTERED MY MOTHER I DONT KNOW WHATS THE MATTER I SHALL DIE I AM SURE NO NO NO SAID MISS BETSEY HAVE SOME TEA OH DEAR ME DEAR ME DO YOU THINK IT WILL DO ME ANY GOOD

BABY EXCLAIMED MISS BETSEY UNCONSCIOUSLY QUOTING THE SECOND SENTIMENT OF THE PINCUSHION IN THE DRAWER UPSTAIRS BUT APPLYING IT TO MY MOTHER INSTEAD OF ME I DONT MEAN THAT I MEAN YOUR SERVANTGIRL PEGGOTTY SAID MY MOTHER PEGGOTTY REPEATED MISS BETSEY WITH SOME INDIGNATION DO YOU MEAN TO SAY CHILD THAT ANY HUMAN BEING HAS GONE INTO A CHRISTIAN CHURCH AND GOT HERSELF NAMED PEGGOTTY ITS HER SURNAME SAID MY MOTHER FAINTLY MR COPPERFIELD CALLED HER BY IT BECAUSE HER CHRISTIAN NAME WAS THE SAME AS MINE HERE PEGGOTTY CRIED MISS BETSEY OPENING THE PARLOUR DOOR TEA YOUR MISTRESS IS A LITTLE UNWELL DONT DAWDLE HAVING ISSUED THIS MANDATE WITH AS MUCH POTENTIALITY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A RECOGNIZED AUTHORITY IN THE HOUSE EVER SINCE IT HAD BEEN A HOUSE AND HAVING LOOKED OUT TO CONFRONT THE AMAZED PEGGOTTY COMING ALONG THE PASSAGE WITH A CANDLE AT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE MISS BETSEY SHUT THE DOOR AGAIN AND SAT DOWN AS BEFORE WITH HER FEET ON THE FENDER THE SKIRT OF HER DRESS TUCKED UP AND HER HANDS FOLDED ON ONE KNEE YOU WERE SPEAKING ABOUT ITS BEING A GIRL SAID MISS BETSEY I HAVE NO DOUBT IT WILL BE A GIRL I HAVE A PRESENTIMENT THAT IT MUST BE A GIRL NOW CHILD FROM THE MOMENT

MISS BETSEYS HEAD AFTER EACH OF THESE SENTENCES AS IF HER OWN OLD WRONGS WERE WORKING WITHIN HER AND SHE REPRESSED ANY PLAINER REFERENCE TO THEM BY STRONG CONSTRAINT SO MY MOTHER SUSPECTED AT LEAST AS SHE OBSERVED HER BY THE LOW GLIMMER OF THE FIRE TOO MUCH SCARED BY MISS BETSEY TOO UNEASY IN HERSELF AND TOO SUBDUED AND BEWILDERED ALTOGETHER TO OBSERVE ANYTHING VERY CLEARLY OR TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY

NO FARTHER WELL WELL SAID MISS BETSEY I KEPT MY HOUSEKEEPINGBOOK REGULARLY AND BALANCED IT WITH MR COPPERFIELD EVERY NIGHT CRIED MY MOTHER IN ANOTHER BURST OF DISTRESS AND BREAKING DOWN AGAIN WELL WELL SAID MISS BETSEY DONT CRY ANY MORE AND I AM SURE WE NEVER HAD A WORD OF DIFFERENCE RESPECTING IT EXCEPT WHEN MR COPPERFIELD OBJECTED TO MY THREES AND FIVES BEING TOO MUCH LIKE EACH OTHER OR TO MY PUTTING CURLY TAILS TO MY SEVENS AND NINES RESUMED MY MOTHER IN ANOTHER BURST AND BREAKING DOWN AGAIN YOULL MAKE YOURSELF ILL SAID MISS BETSEY AND YOU KNOW THAT WILL NOT BE GOOD EITHER FOR YOU OR FOR MY GODDAUGHTER COME YOU MUSTNT DO IT THIS ARGUMENT HAD SOME SHARE IN QUIETING MY MOTHER THOUGH HER INCREASING INDISPOSITION HAD A LARGER ONE THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF SILENCE ONLY BROKEN BY MISS BETSEYS OCCASIONALLY EJACULATING HA AS SHE SAT WITH HER FEET UPON THE FENDER DAVID HAD BOUGHT AN ANNUITY FOR HIMSELF WITH HIS MONEY I KNOW SAID SHE BY AND BY WHAT DID HE DO FOR YOU MR COPPERFIELD SAID MY MOTHER ANSWERING WITH SOME DIFFICULTY WAS SO CONSIDERATE AND GOOD AS TO SECURE THE REVERSION OF A PART OF IT TO ME HOW MUCH ASKED MISS BETSEY A HUNDRED AND FIVE POUNDS A YEAR SAID MY MOTHER HE MIGHT HAVE DONE WORSE SAID MY AUNT THE WORD WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE MOMENT MY MOTHER WAS SO MUCH WORSE THAT PEGGOTTY COMING IN WITH THE TEABOARD AND CANDLES AND SEEING AT A GLANCE HOW ILL SHE WASAS MISS BETSEY MIGHT HAVE DONE SOONER IF THERE HAD BEEN LIGHT ENOUGHCONVEYED HER UPSTAIRS TO HER OWN ROOM WITH ALL SPEED AND IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED HAM PEGGOTTY HER NEPHEW WHO HAD BEEN FOR SOME DAYS PAST SECRETED IN THE HOUSE UNKNOWN TO MY MOTHER AS A SPECIAL MESSENGER IN CASE OF EMERGENCY TO FETCH THE NURSE AND DOCTOR THOSE ALLIED POWERS WERE CONSIDERABLY ASTONISHED WHEN THEY ARRIVED WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF EACH OTHER TO FIND AN UNKNOWN LADY OF PORTENTOUS APPEARANCE SITTING BEFORE THE FIRE WITH HER BONNET TIED OVER HER LEFT ARM STOPPING HER EARS WITH JEWELLERS COTTON PEGGOTTY KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT HER AND MY MOTHER SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HER SHE WAS QUITE A MYSTERY IN THE PARLOUR AND THE FACT OF HER HAVING A MAGAZINE OF JEWELLERS COTTON IN HER POCKET AND STICKING THE ARTICLE IN HER EARS IN THAT WAY DID NOT DETRACT FROM THE SOLEMNITY OF HER PRESENCE THE DOCTOR HAVING BEEN UPSTAIRS AND COME DOWN AGAIN AND HAVING SATISFIED HIMSELF I SUPPOSE THAT THERE WAS A PROBABILITY OF THIS UNKNOWN LADY AND HIMSELF HAVING TO SIT THERE FACE TO FACE FOR SOME HOURS LAID HIMSELF OUT TO BE POLITE AND SOCIAL HE WAS THE MEEKEST OF HIS SEX THE MILDEST OF LITTLE MEN HE SIDLED IN AND OUT OF A ROOM TO TAKE UP THE LESS SPACE HE WALKED AS SOFTLY AS THE GHOST IN HAMLET AND MORE SLOWLY HE CARRIED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE PARTLY IN MODEST DEPRECIATION OF HIMSELF PARTLY IN MODEST PROPITIATION OF EVERYBODY ELSE IT IS NOTHING TO SAY THAT HE HADNT A WORD TO THROW AT A DOG HE COULDNT HAVE THROWN A WORD AT A MAD DOG HE MIGHT HAVE OFFERED HIM ONE GENTLY OR HALF A ONE OR A FRAGMENT OF ONE FOR HE SPOKE AS SLOWLY AS HE WALKED BUT HE WOULDNT HAVE BEEN RUDE TO HIM AND HE COULDNT HAVE BEEN QUICK WITH HIM FOR ANY EARTHLY CONSIDERATION MR CHILLIP LOOKING MILDLY AT MY AUNT WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND MAKING HER A LITTLE BOW SAID IN ALLUSION TO THE JEWELLERS COTTON AS HE SOFTLY TOUCHED HIS LEFT EAR SOME LOCAL IRRITATION MAAM WHAT REPLIED MY AUNT PULLING THE COTTON OUT OF ONE EAR LIKE A CORK MR CHILLIP WAS SO ALARMED BY HER ABRUPTNESSAS HE TOLD MY MOTHER AFTERWARDSTHAT IT WAS A MERCY HE DIDNT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND BUT HE REPEATED SWEETLY SOME LOCAL IRRITATION MAAM NONSENSE REPLIED MY AUNT AND CORKED HERSELF AGAIN AT ONE BLOW MR CHILLIP COULD DO NOTHING AFTER THIS BUT SIT AND LOOK AT HER FEEBLY AS SHE SAT AND LOOKED AT THE FIRE UNTIL HE WAS CALLED UPSTAIRS AGAIN AFTER SOME QUARTER OF AN HOURS ABSENCE HE RETURNED WELL SAID MY AUNT TAKING THE COTTON OUT OF THE EAR NEAREST TO HIM WELL MAAM RETURNED MR CHILLIP WE AREWE ARE PROGRESSING SLOWLY MAAM BAAAH SAID MY AUNT WITH A PERFECT SHAKE ON THE CONTEMPTUOUS INTERJECTION AND CORKED HERSELF AS BEFORE REALLYREALLYAS MR CHILLIP TOLD MY MOTHER HE WAS ALMOST SHOCKED SPEAKING IN A PROFESSIONAL POINT OF VIEW ALONE HE WAS ALMOST SHOCKED BUT HE SAT AND LOOKED AT HER NOTWITHSTANDING FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS AS SHE SAT LOOKING AT THE FIRE UNTIL HE WAS AGAIN CALLED OUT AFTER ANOTHER ABSENCE HE AGAIN RETURNED WELL SAID MY AUNT TAKING OUT THE COTTON ON THAT SIDE AGAIN WELL MAAM RETURNED MR CHILLIP WE AREWE ARE PROGRESSING SLOWLY MAAM YAAAH SAID MY AUNT WITH SUCH A SNARL AT HIM THAT MR CHILLIP ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT BEAR IT IT WAS REALLY CALCULATED TO BREAK HIS SPIRIT HE SAID AFTERWARDS HE PREFERRED TO GO AND SIT UPON THE STAIRS IN THE DARK AND A STRONG DRAUGHT UNTIL HE WAS AGAIN SENT FOR HAM PEGGOTTY WHO WENT TO THE NATIONAL SCHOOL AND WAS A VERY DRAGON AT HIS CATECHISM AND WHO MAY THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS A CREDIBLE WITNESS REPORTED NEXT DAY THAT HAPPENING TO PEEP IN AT THE PARLOURDOOR AN HOUR AFTER THIS HE WAS INSTANTLY DESCRIED BY MISS BETSEY THEN WALKING TO AND FRO IN A STATE OF AGITATION AND POUNCED UPON BEFORE HE COULD MAKE HIS ESCAPE THAT THERE WERE NOW OCCASIONAL SOUNDS OF FEET AND VOICES OVERHEAD WHICH HE INFERRED THE COTTON DID NOT EXCLUDE FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS EVIDENTLY BEING CLUTCHED BY THE LADY AS A VICTIM ON WHOM TO EXPEND HER SUPERABUNDANT AGITATION WHEN THE SOUNDS WERE LOUDEST THAT MARCHING HIM CONSTANTLY UP AND DOWN BY THE COLLAR AS IF HE HAD BEEN TAKING TOO MUCH LAUDANUM SHE AT THOSE TIMES SHOOK HIM RUMPLED HIS HAIR MADE LIGHT OF HIS LINEN STOPPED HIS EARS AS IF SHE CONFOUNDED THEM WITH HER OWN AND OTHERWISE TOUSLED AND MALTREATED HIM THIS WAS IN PART CONFIRMED BY HIS AUNT WHO SAW HIM AT HALF PAST TWELVE OCLOCK SOON AFTER HIS RELEASE AND AFFIRMED THAT HE WAS THEN AS RED AS I WAS THE MILD MR CHILLIP COULD NOT POSSIBLY BEAR MALICE AT SUCH A TIME IF AT ANY TIME HE SIDLED INTO THE PARLOUR AS SOON AS HE WAS AT LIBERTY AND SAID TO MY AUNT IN HIS MEEKEST MANNER WELL MAAM I AM HAPPY TO CONGRATULATE YOU WHAT UPON SAID MY AUNT SHARPLY MR CHILLIP WAS FLUTTERED AGAIN BY THE EXTREME SEVERITY OF MY AUNTS MANNER SO HE MADE HER A LITTLE BOW AND GAVE HER A LITTLE SMILE TO MOLLIFY HER MERCY ON THE MAN WHATS HE DOING CRIED MY AUNT IMPATIENTLY CANT HE SPEAK BE CALM MY DEAR MAAM SAID MR CHILLIP IN HIS SOFTEST ACCENTS THERE IS NO LONGER ANY OCCASION FOR UNEASINESS MAAM BE CALM IT HAS SINCE BEEN CONSIDERED ALMOST A MIRACLE THAT MY AUNT DIDNT SHAKE HIM AND SHAKE WHAT HE HAD TO SAY OUT OF HIM SHE ONLY SHOOK HER OWN HEAD AT HIM BUT IN A WAY THAT MADE HIM QUAIL WELL MAAM RESUMED MR CHILLIP AS SOON AS HE HAD COURAGE I AM HAPPY TO CONGRATULATE YOU ALL IS NOW OVER MAAM AND WELL OVER DURING THE FIVE MINUTES OR SO THAT MR CHILLIP DEVOTED TO THE DELIVERY OF THIS ORATION MY AUNT EYED HIM NARROWLY HOW IS SHE SAID MY AUNT FOLDING HER ARMS WITH HER BONNET STILL TIED ON ONE OF THEM WELL MAAM SHE WILL SOON BE QUITE COMFORTABLE I HOPE RETURNED MR CHILLIP QUITE AS COMFORTABLE AS WE CAN EXPECT A YOUNG MOTHER TO BE UNDER THESE MELANCHOLY DOMESTIC CIRCUMSTANCES THERE CANNOT BE ANY OBJECTION TO YOUR SEEING HER PRESENTLY MAAM IT MAY DO HER GOOD AND SHE HOW IS SHE SAID MY AUNT SHARPLY MR CHILLIP LAID HIS HEAD A LITTLE MORE ON ONE SIDE AND LOOKED AT MY AUNT LIKE AN AMIABLE BIRD THE BABY SAID MY AUNT HOW IS SHE MAAM RETURNED MR CHILLIP I APPREHENDED YOU HAD KNOWN ITS A BOY MY AUNT SAID NEVER A WORD BUT TOOK HER BONNET BY THE STRINGS IN THE MANNER OF A SLING AIMED A BLOW AT MR CHILLIPS HEAD WITH IT PUT IT ON BENT WALKED OUT AND NEVER CAME BACK SHE VANISHED LIKE A DISCONTENTED FAIRY OR LIKE ONE OF THOSE SUPERNATURAL BEINGS WHOM IT WAS POPULARLY SUPPOSED I WAS ENTITLED TO SEE AND NEVER CAME BACK ANY MORE NO I LAY IN MY BASKET AND MY MOTHER LAY IN HER BED BUT BETSEY TROTWOOD COPPERFIELD WAS FOR EVER IN THE LAND OF DREAMS AND SHADOWS THE TREMENDOUS REGION WHENCE I HAD SO LATELY TRAVELLED AND THE LIGHT UPON THE WINDOW OF OUR ROOM SHONE OUT UPON THE EARTHLY BOURNE OF ALL SUCH TRAVELLERS AND THE MOUND ABOVE THE ASHES AND THE DUST THAT ONCE WAS HE WITHOUT WHOM I HAD NEVER BEEN CHAPTER I OBSERVE THE FIRST OBJECTS THAT ASSUME A DISTINCT PRESENCE BEFORE ME AS I LOOK FAR BACK INTO THE BLANK OF MY INFANCY ARE MY MOTHER WITH HER PRETTY HAIR AND YOUTHFUL SHAPE AND PEGGOTTY WITH NO SHAPE AT ALL AND EYES SO DARK THAT THEY SEEMED TO DARKEN THEIR WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN HER FACE AND CHEEKS AND ARMS SO HARD AND RED THAT I WONDERED THE BIRDS DIDNT PECK HER IN PREFERENCE TO APPLES I BELIEVE I CAN REMEMBER THESE TWO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE APART DWARFED TO MY SIGHT BY STOOPING DOWN OR KNEELING ON THE FLOOR AND I GOING UNSTEADILY FROM THE ONE TO THE OTHER I HAVE AN IMPRESSION ON MY MIND WHICH I CANNOT DISTINGUISH FROM ACTUAL REMEMBRANCE OF THE TOUCH OF PEGGOTTYS FOREFINGER AS SHE USED TO HOLD IT OUT TO ME AND OF ITS BEING ROUGHENED BY NEEDLEWORK LIKE A POCKET NUTMEGGRATER THIS MAY BE FANCY THOUGH I THINK THE MEMORY OF MOST OF US CAN GO FARTHER BACK INTO SUCH TIMES THAN MANY OF US SUPPOSE JUST AS I BELIEVE THE POWER OF OBSERVATION IN NUMBERS OF VERY YOUNG CHILDREN TO BE QUITE WONDERFUL FOR ITS CLOSENESS AND ACCURACY INDEED I THINK THAT MOST GROWN MEN WHO ARE REMARKABLE IN THIS RESPECT MAY WITH GREATER PROPRIETY BE SAID NOT TO HAVE LOST THE FACULTY THAN TO HAVE ACQUIRED IT THE RATHER AS I GENERALLY OBSERVE SUCH MEN TO RETAIN A CERTAIN FRESHNESS AND GENTLENESS AND CAPACITY OF BEING PLEASED WHICH ARE ALSO AN INHERITANCE THEY HAVE PRESERVED FROM THEIR CHILDHOOD I MIGHT HAVE A MISGIVING THAT I AM MEANDERING IN STOPPING TO SAY THIS BUT THAT IT BRINGS ME TO REMARK THAT I BUILD THESE CONCLUSIONS IN PART UPON MY OWN EXPERIENCE OF MYSELF AND IF IT SHOULD APPEAR FROM ANYTHING I MAY SET DOWN IN THIS NARRATIVE THAT I WAS A CHILD OF CLOSE OBSERVATION OR THAT AS A MAN I HAVE A STRONG MEMORY OF MY CHILDHOOD I UNDOUBTEDLY LAY CLAIM TO BOTH OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS LOOKING BACK AS I WAS SAYING INTO THE BLANK OF MY INFANCY THE FIRST OBJECTS I CAN REMEMBER AS STANDING OUT BY THEMSELVES FROM A CONFUSION OF THINGS ARE MY MOTHER AND PEGGOTTY WHAT ELSE DO I REMEMBER LET ME SEE THERE COMES OUT OF THE CLOUD OUR HOUSENOT NEW TO ME BUT QUITE FAMILIAR IN ITS EARLIEST REMEMBRANCE ON THE GROUNDFLOOR IS PEGGOTTYS KITCHEN OPENING INTO A BACK YARD WITH A PIGEONHOUSE ON A POLE IN THE CENTRE WITHOUT ANY PIGEONS IN IT A GREAT DOGKENNEL IN A CORNER WITHOUT ANY DOG AND A QUANTITY OF FOWLS THAT LOOK TERRIBLY TALL TO ME WALKING ABOUT IN A MENACING AND FEROCIOUS MANNER THERE IS ONE COCK WHO GETS UPON A POST TO CROW AND SEEMS TO TAKE PARTICULAR NOTICE OF ME AS I LOOK AT HIM THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW WHO MAKES ME SHIVER HE IS SO FIERCE OF THE GEESE OUTSIDE THE SIDEGATE WHO COME WADDLING AFTER ME WITH THEIR LONG NECKS STRETCHED OUT WHEN I GO THAT WAY I DREAM AT NIGHT AS A MAN ENVIRONED BY WILD BEASTS MIGHT DREAM OF LIONS HERE IS A LONG PASSAGEWHAT AN ENORMOUS PERSPECTIVE I MAKE OF ITLEADING FROM PEGGOTTYS KITCHEN TO THE FRONT DOOR A DARK STOREROOM OPENS OUT OF IT AND THAT IS A PLACE TO BE RUN PAST AT NIGHT FOR I DONT KNOW WHAT MAY BE AMONG THOSE TUBS AND JARS AND OLD TEACHESTS WHEN THERE IS NOBODY IN THERE WITH A DIMLYBURNING LIGHT LETTING A MOULDY AIR COME OUT OF THE DOOR IN WHICH THERE IS THE SMELL OF SOAP PICKLES PEPPER CANDLES AND COFFEE ALL AT ONE WHIFF THEN THERE ARE THE TWO PARLOURS THE PARLOUR IN WHICH WE SIT OF AN EVENING MY MOTHER AND I AND PEGGOTTYFOR PEGGOTTY IS QUITE OUR COMPANION WHEN HER WORK IS DONE AND WE ARE ALONEAND THE BEST PARLOUR WHERE WE SIT ON A SUNDAY GRANDLY BUT NOT SO COMFORTABLY THERE IS SOMETHING OF A DOLEFUL AIR ABOUT THAT ROOM TO ME FOR PEGGOTTY HAS TOLD MEI DONT KNOW WHEN BUT APPARENTLY AGES AGOABOUT MY FATHERS FUNERAL AND THE COMPANY HAVING THEIR BLACK CLOAKS PUT ON ONE SUNDAY NIGHT MY MOTHER READS TO PEGGOTTY AND ME IN THERE HOW LAZARUS WAS RAISED UP FROM THE DEAD AND I AM SO FRIGHTENED THAT THEY ARE AFTERWARDS OBLIGED TO TAKE ME OUT OF BED AND SHOW ME THE QUIET CHURCHYARD OUT OF THE BEDROOM WINDOW WITH THE DEAD ALL LYING IN THEIR GRAVES AT REST BELOW THE SOLEMN MOON THERE IS NOTHING HALF SO GREEN THAT I KNOW ANYWHERE AS THE GRASS OF THAT CHURCHYARD NOTHING HALF SO SHADY AS ITS TREES NOTHING HALF SO QUIET AS ITS TOMBSTONES THE SHEEP ARE FEEDING THERE WHEN I KNEEL UP EARLY IN THE MORNING IN MY LITTLE BED IN A CLOSET WITHIN MY MOTHERS ROOM TO LOOK OUT AT IT AND I SEE THE RED LIGHT SHINING ON THE SUNDIAL AND THINK WITHIN MYSELF IS THE SUNDIAL GLAD I WONDER THAT IT CAN TELL THE TIME AGAIN HERE IS OUR PEW IN THE CHURCH WHAT A HIGHBACKED PEW WITH A WINDOW NEAR IT OUT OF WHICH OUR HOUSE CAN BE SEEN AND IS SEEN MANY TIMES DURING THE MORNINGS SERVICE BY PEGGOTTY WHO LIKES TO MAKE HERSELF AS SURE AS SHE CAN THAT ITS NOT BEING ROBBED OR IS NOT IN FLAMES BUT THOUGH PEGGOTTYS EYE WANDERS SHE IS MUCH OFFENDED IF MINE DOES AND FROWNS TO ME AS I STAND UPON THE SEAT THAT I AM TO LOOK AT THE CLERGYMAN BUT I CANT ALWAYS LOOK AT HIMI KNOW HIM WITHOUT THAT WHITE THING ON AND I AM AFRAID OF HIS WONDERING WHY I STARE SO AND PERHAPS STOPPING THE SERVICE TO INQUIREAND WHAT AM I TO DO ITS A DREADFUL THING TO GAPE BUT I MUST DO SOMETHING I LOOK AT MY MOTHER BUT SHE PRETENDS NOT TO SEE ME I LOOK AT A BOY IN THE AISLE AND HE MAKES FACES AT ME I LOOK AT THE SUNLIGHT COMING IN AT THE OPEN DOOR THROUGH THE PORCH AND THERE I SEE A STRAY SHEEPI DONT MEAN A SINNER BUT MUTTONHALF MAKING UP HIS MIND TO COME INTO THE CHURCH I FEEL THAT IF I LOOKED AT HIM ANY LONGER I MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO SAY SOMETHING OUT LOUD AND WHAT WOULD BECOME OF ME THEN I LOOK UP AT THE MONUMENTAL TABLETS ON THE WALL AND TRY TO THINK OF MR BODGERS LATE OF THIS PARISH AND WHAT THE FEELINGS OF MRS BODGERS MUST HAVE BEEN WHEN AFFLICTION SORE LONG TIME MR BODGERS BORE AND PHYSICIANS WERE IN VAIN I WONDER WHETHER THEY CALLED IN MR CHILLIP AND HE WAS IN VAIN AND IF SO HOW HE LIKES TO BE REMINDED OF IT ONCE A WEEK I LOOK FROM MR CHILLIP IN HIS SUNDAY NECKCLOTH TO THE PULPIT AND THINK WHAT A GOOD PLACE IT WOULD BE TO PLAY IN AND WHAT A CASTLE IT WOULD MAKE WITH ANOTHER BOY COMING UP THE STAIRS TO ATTACK IT AND HAVING THE VELVET CUSHION WITH THE TASSELS THROWN DOWN ON HIS HEAD IN TIME MY EYES GRADUALLY SHUT UP AND FROM SEEMING TO HEAR THE CLERGYMAN SINGING A DROWSY SONG IN THE HEAT I HEAR NOTHING UNTIL I FALL OFF THE SEAT WITH A CRASH AND AM TAKEN OUT MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE BY PEGGOTTY AND NOW I SEE THE OUTSIDE OF OUR HOUSE WITH THE LATTICED BEDROOMWINDOWS STANDING OPEN TO LET IN THE SWEETSMELLING AIR AND THE RAGGED OLD ROOKSNESTS STILL DANGLING IN THE ELMTREES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FRONT GARDEN NOW I AM IN THE GARDEN AT THE BACK BEYOND THE YARD WHERE THE EMPTY PIGEONHOUSE AND DOGKENNEL AREA VERY PRESERVE OF BUTTERFLIES AS I REMEMBER IT WITH A HIGH FENCE AND A GATE AND PADLOCK WHERE THE FRUIT CLUSTERS ON THE TREES RIPER AND RICHER THAN FRUIT HAS EVER BEEN SINCE IN ANY OTHER GARDEN AND WHERE MY MOTHER GATHERS SOME IN A BASKET WHILE I STAND BY BOLTING FURTIVE GOOSEBERRIES AND TRYING TO LOOK UNMOVED A GREAT WIND RISES AND THE SUMMER IS GONE IN A MOMENT WE ARE PLAYING IN THE WINTER TWILIGHT DANCING ABOUT THE PARLOUR WHEN MY MOTHER IS OUT OF BREATH AND RESTS HERSELF IN AN ELBOWCHAIR I WATCH HER WINDING HER BRIGHT CURLS ROUND HER FINGERS AND STRAITENING HER WAIST AND NOBODY KNOWS BETTER THAN I DO THAT SHE LIKES TO LOOK SO WELL AND IS PROUD OF BEING SO PRETTY THAT IS AMONG MY VERY EARLIEST IMPRESSIONS THAT AND A SENSE THAT WE WERE BOTH A LITTLE AFRAID OF PEGGOTTY AND SUBMITTED OURSELVES IN MOST THINGS TO HER DIRECTION WERE AMONG THE FIRST OPINIONSIF THEY MAY BE SO CALLEDTHAT I EVER DERIVED FROM WHAT I SAW PEGGOTTY AND I WERE SITTING ONE NIGHT BY THE PARLOUR FIRE ALONE I HAD BEEN READING TO PEGGOTTY ABOUT CROCODILES I MUST HAVE READ VERY PERSPICUOUSLY OR THE POOR SOUL MUST HAVE BEEN DEEPLY INTERESTED FOR I REMEMBER SHE HAD A CLOUDY IMPRESSION AFTER I HAD DONE THAT THEY WERE A SORT OF VEGETABLE I WAS TIRED OF READING AND DEAD SLEEPY BUT HAVING LEAVE AS A HIGH TREAT TO SIT UP UNTIL MY MOTHER CAME HOME FROM SPENDING THE EVENING AT A NEIGHBOURS I WOULD RATHER HAVE DIED UPON MY POST OF COURSE THAN HAVE GONE TO BED I HAD REACHED THAT STAGE OF SLEEPINESS WHEN PEGGOTTY SEEMED TO SWELL AND GROW IMMENSELY LARGE I PROPPED MY EYELIDS OPEN WITH MY TWO FOREFINGERS AND LOOKED PERSEVERINGLY AT HER AS SHE SAT AT WORK AT THE LITTLE BIT OF WAXCANDLE SHE KEPT FOR HER THREADHOW OLD IT LOOKED BEING SO WRINKLED IN ALL DIRECTIONSAT THE LITTLE HOUSE WITH A THATCHED ROOF WHERE THE YARDMEASURE LIVED AT HER WORKBOX WITH A SLIDING LID WITH A VIEW OF ST PAULS CATHEDRAL WITH A PINK DOME PAINTED ON THE TOP AT THE BRASS THIMBLE ON HER FINGER AT HERSELF WHOM I THOUGHT LOVELY I FELT SO SLEEPY THAT I KNEW IF I LOST SIGHT OF ANYTHING FOR A MOMENT I WAS GONE PEGGOTTY SAYS I SUDDENLY WERE YOU EVER MARRIED LORD MASTER DAVY REPLIED PEGGOTTY WHATS PUT MARRIAGE IN YOUR HEAD SHE ANSWERED WITH SUCH A START THAT IT QUITE AWOKE ME AND THEN SHE STOPPED IN HER WORK AND LOOKED AT ME WITH HER NEEDLE DRAWN OUT TO ITS THREADS LENGTH BUT WERE YOU EVER MARRIED PEGGOTTY SAYS I YOU ARE A VERY HANDSOME WOMAN ANT YOU I THOUGHT HER IN A DIFFERENT STYLE FROM MY MOTHER CERTAINLY BUT OF ANOTHER SCHOOL OF BEAUTY I CONSIDERED HER A PERFECT EXAMPLE THERE WAS A RED VELVET FOOTSTOOL IN THE BEST PARLOUR ON WHICH MY MOTHER HAD PAINTED A NOSEGAY THE GROUNDWORK OF THAT STOOL AND PEGGOTTYS COMPLEXION APPEARED TO ME TO BE ONE AND THE SAME THING THE STOOL WAS SMOOTH AND PEGGOTTY WAS ROUGH BUT THAT MADE NO DIFFERENCE ME HANDSOME DAVY SAID PEGGOTTY LAWK NO MY DEAR BUT WHAT PUT MARRIAGE IN YOUR HEAD I DONT KNOWYOU MUSTNT MARRY MORE THAN ONE PERSON AT A TIME MAY YOU PEGGOTTY CERTAINLY NOT SAYS PEGGOTTY WITH THE PROMPTEST DECISION BUT IF YOU MARRY A PERSON AND THE PERSON DIES WHY THEN YOU MAY MARRY ANOTHER PERSON MAYNT YOU PEGGOTTY YOU MAY SAYS PEGGOTTY IF YOU CHOOSE MY DEAR THATS A MATTER OF OPINION BUT WHAT IS YOUR OPINION PEGGOTTY SAID I I ASKED HER AND LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT HER BECAUSE SHE LOOKED SO CURIOUSLY AT ME MY OPINION IS SAID PEGGOTTY TAKING HER EYES FROM ME AFTER A LITTLE INDECISION AND GOING ON WITH HER WORK THAT I NEVER WAS MARRIED MYSELF MASTER DAVY AND THAT I DONT EXPECT TO BE THATS ALL I KNOW ABOUT THE SUBJECT YOU ANT CROSS I SUPPOSE PEGGOTTY ARE YOU SAID I AFTER SITTING QUIET FOR A MINUTE I REALLY THOUGHT SHE WAS SHE HAD BEEN SO SHORT WITH ME BUT I WAS QUITE MISTAKEN FOR SHE LAID ASIDE HER WORK WHICH WAS A STOCKING OF HER OWN AND OPENING HER ARMS WIDE TOOK MY CURLY HEAD WITHIN THEM AND GAVE IT A GOOD SQUEEZE I KNOW IT WAS A GOOD SQUEEZE BECAUSE BEING VERY PLUMP WHENEVER SHE MADE ANY LITTLE EXERTION AFTER SHE WAS DRESSED SOME OF THE BUTTONS ON THE BACK OF HER GOWN FLEW OFF AND I RECOLLECT TWO BURSTING TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE PARLOUR WHILE SHE WAS HUGGING ME NOW LET ME HEAR SOME MORE ABOUT THE CRORKINDILLS SAID PEGGOTTY WHO WAS NOT QUITE RIGHT IN THE NAME YET FOR I ANT HEARD HALF ENOUGH I COULDNT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY PEGGOTTY LOOKED SO QUEER OR WHY SHE WAS SO READY TO GO BACK TO THE CROCODILES HOWEVER WE RETURNED TO THOSE MONSTERS WITH FRESH WAKEFULNESS ON MY PART AND WE LEFT THEIR EGGS IN THE SAND FOR THE SUN TO HATCH AND WE RAN AWAY FROM THEM AND BAFFLED THEM BY CONSTANTLY TURNING WHICH THEY WERE UNABLE TO DO QUICKLY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR UNWIELDY MAKE AND WE WENT INTO THE WATER AFTER THEM AS NATIVES AND PUT SHARP PIECES OF TIMBER DOWN THEIR THROATS AND IN SHORT WE RAN THE WHOLE CROCODILE GAUNTLET I DID AT LEAST BUT I HAD MY DOUBTS OF PEGGOTTY WHO WAS THOUGHTFULLY STICKING HER NEEDLE INTO VARIOUS PARTS OF HER FACE AND ARMS ALL THE TIME WE HAD EXHAUSTED THE CROCODILES AND BEGUN WITH THE ALLIGATORS WHEN THE GARDENBELL RANG WE WENT OUT TO THE DOOR AND THERE WAS MY MOTHER LOOKING UNUSUALLY PRETTY I THOUGHT AND WITH HER A GENTLEMAN WITH BEAUTIFUL BLACK HAIR AND WHISKERS WHO HAD WALKED HOME WITH US FROM CHURCH LAST SUNDAY AS MY MOTHER STOOPED DOWN ON THE THRESHOLD TO TAKE ME IN HER ARMS AND KISS ME THE GENTLEMAN SAID I WAS A MORE HIGHLY PRIVILEGED LITTLE FELLOW THAN A MONARCHOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR MY LATER UNDERSTANDING COMES I AM SENSIBLE TO MY AID HERE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I ASKED HIM OVER HER SHOULDER HE PATTED ME ON THE HEAD BUT SOMEHOW I DIDNT LIKE HIM OR HIS DEEP VOICE AND I WAS JEALOUS THAT HIS HAND SHOULD TOUCH MY MOTHERS IN TOUCHING MEWHICH IT DID I PUT IT AWAY AS WELL AS I COULD OH DAVY REMONSTRATED MY MOTHER DEAR BOY SAID THE GENTLEMAN I CANNOT WONDER AT HIS DEVOTION I NEVER SAW SUCH A BEAUTIFUL COLOUR ON MY MOTHERS FACE BEFORE SHE GENTLY CHID ME FOR BEING RUDE AND KEEPING ME CLOSE TO HER SHAWL TURNED TO THANK THE GENTLEMAN FOR TAKING SO MUCH TROUBLE AS TO BRING HER HOME SHE PUT OUT HER HAND TO HIM AS SHE SPOKE AND AS HE MET IT WITH HIS OWN SHE GLANCED I THOUGHT AT ME LET US SAY GOOD NIGHT MY FINE BOY SAID THE GENTLEMAN WHEN HE HAD BENT HIS HEADI SAW HIMOVER MY MOTHERS LITTLE GLOVE GOOD NIGHT SAID I COME LET US BE THE BEST FRIENDS IN THE WORLD SAID THE GENTLEMAN LAUGHING SHAKE HANDS MY RIGHT HAND

DID NOT I GAVE HIM THE OTHER AND HE SHOOK IT HEARTILY AND SAID I WAS A BRAVE FELLOW AND WENT AWAY AT THIS MINUTE I SEE HIM TURN ROUND IN THE GARDEN AND GIVE US A LAST LOOK WITH HIS ILLOMENED BLACK EYES BEFORE THE DOOR WAS SHUT PEGGOTTY WHO HAD NOT SAID A WORD OR MOVED A FINGER SECURED THE FASTENINGS INSTANTLY AND WE ALL WENT INTO THE PARLOUR MY MOTHER CONTRARY TO HER USUAL HABIT INSTEAD OF COMING TO THE ELBOWCHAIR BY THE FIRE REMAINED AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AND SAT SINGING TO HERSELF HOPE YOU HAVE HAD A PLEASANT EVENING MAAM SAID PEGGOTTY STANDING AS STIFF AS A BARREL IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM WITH A CANDLESTICK IN HER HAND MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU PEGGOTTY RETURNED MY MOTHER IN A CHEERFUL VOICE I HAVE HAD A VERY PLEASANT EVENING A STRANGER OR SO MAKES AN AGREEABLE CHANGE SUGGESTED PEGGOTTY A VERY AGREEABLE CHANGE INDEED RETURNED MY MOTHER PEGGOTTY CONTINUING TO STAND MOTIONLESS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND MY MOTHER RESUMING HER SINGING I FELL ASLEEP THOUGH I WAS NOT SO SOUND ASLEEP BUT THAT I COULD HEAR VOICES WITHOUT HEARING WHAT THEY SAID WHEN I HALF AWOKE FROM THIS UNCOMFORTABLE DOZE I FOUND PEGGOTTY AND MY MOTHER BOTH IN TEARS AND BOTH TALKING NOT SUCH A ONE

FELL ACRYING TOGETHER I THINK I WAS THE LOUDEST OF THE PARTY BUT I AM SURE WE WERE ALL SINCERE ABOUT IT I WAS QUITE HEARTBROKEN MYSELF AND AM AFRAID THAT IN THE FIRST TRANSPORTS OF WOUNDED TENDERNESS I CALLED PEGGOTTY A BEAST THAT HONEST CREATURE WAS IN DEEP AFFLICTION I REMEMBER AND MUST HAVE BECOME QUITE BUTTONLESS ON THE OCCASION FOR A LITTLE VOLLEY OF THOSE EXPLOSIVES WENT OFF WHEN AFTER HAVING MADE IT UP WITH MY MOTHER SHE KNEELED DOWN BY THE ELBOWCHAIR AND MADE IT UP WITH ME WE WENT TO BED GREATLY DEJECTED MY SOBS KEPT WAKING ME FOR A LONG TIME AND WHEN ONE VERY STRONG SOB QUITE HOISTED ME UP IN BED I FOUND MY MOTHER SITTING ON THE COVERLET AND LEANING OVER ME I FELL ASLEEP IN HER ARMS AFTER THAT AND SLEPT SOUNDLY WHETHER IT WAS THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY WHEN I SAW THE GENTLEMAN AGAIN OR WHETHER THERE WAS ANY GREATER LAPSE OF TIME BEFORE HE REAPPEARED I CANNOT RECALL I DONT PROFESS TO BE CLEAR ABOUT DATES BUT THERE HE WAS IN CHURCH AND HE WALKED HOME WITH US AFTERWARDS HE CAME IN TOO TO LOOK AT A FAMOUS GERANIUM WE HAD IN THE PARLOURWINDOW IT DID NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT HE TOOK MUCH NOTICE OF IT BUT BEFORE HE WENT HE ASKED MY MOTHER TO GIVE HIM A BIT OF THE BLOSSOM SHE BEGGED HIM TO CHOOSE IT FOR HIMSELF BUT HE REFUSED TO DO THATI COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHYSO SHE PLUCKED IT FOR HIM AND GAVE IT INTO HIS HAND HE SAID HE WOULD NEVER NEVER PART WITH IT ANY MORE AND I THOUGHT HE MUST BE QUITE A FOOL NOT TO KNOW THAT IT WOULD FALL TO PIECES IN A DAY OR TWO PEGGOTTY BEGAN TO BE LESS WITH US OF AN EVENING THAN SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN MY MOTHER DEFERRED TO HER VERY MUCHMORE THAN USUAL IT OCCURRED TO MEAND WE WERE ALL THREE EXCELLENT FRIENDS STILL WE WERE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE USED TO BE AND WERE NOT SO COMFORTABLE AMONG OURSELVES SOMETIMES I FANCIED THAT PEGGOTTY PERHAPS OBJECTED TO MY MOTHERS WEARING ALL THE PRETTY DRESSES SHE HAD IN HER DRAWERS OR TO HER GOING SO OFTEN TO VISIT AT THAT NEIGHBOURS BUT I COULDNT TO MY SATISFACTION MAKE OUT HOW IT WAS GRADUALLY I BECAME USED TO SEEING THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE BLACK WHISKERS I LIKED HIM NO BETTER THAN AT FIRST AND HAD THE SAME UNEASY JEALOUSY OF HIM BUT IF I HAD ANY REASON FOR IT BEYOND A CHILDS INSTINCTIVE DISLIKE AND A GENERAL IDEA THAT PEGGOTTY AND I COULD MAKE MUCH OF MY MOTHER WITHOUT ANY HELP IT CERTAINLY WAS NOT THE REASON THAT I MIGHT HAVE FOUND IF I HAD BEEN OLDER NO SUCH THING CAME INTO MY MIND OR NEAR IT I COULD OBSERVE IN LITTLE PIECES AS IT WERE BUT AS TO MAKING A NET OF A NUMBER OF THESE PIECES AND CATCHING ANYBODY IN IT THAT WAS AS YET BEYOND ME ONE AUTUMN MORNING I WAS WITH MY MOTHER IN THE FRONT GARDEN WHEN MR MURDSTONEI KNEW HIM BY THAT NAME NOWCAME BY ON HORSEBACK HE REINED UP HIS HORSE TO SALUTE MY MOTHER AND SAID HE WAS GOING TO LOWESTOFT TO SEE SOME FRIENDS WHO WERE THERE WITH A YACHT AND MERRILY PROPOSED TO TAKE ME ON THE SADDLE BEFORE HIM IF I WOULD LIKE THE RIDE THE AIR WAS SO CLEAR AND PLEASANT AND THE HORSE SEEMED TO LIKE THE IDEA OF THE RIDE SO MUCH HIMSELF AS HE STOOD SNORTING AND PAWING AT THE GARDENGATE THAT I HAD A GREAT DESIRE TO GO SO I WAS SENT UPSTAIRS TO PEGGOTTY TO BE MADE SPRUCE AND IN THE MEANTIME MR MURDSTONE DISMOUNTED AND WITH HIS HORSES BRIDLE DRAWN OVER HIS ARM WALKED SLOWLY UP AND DOWN ON THE OUTER SIDE OF THE SWEETBRIAR FENCE WHILE MY MOTHER WALKED SLOWLY UP AND DOWN ON THE INNER TO KEEP HIM COMPANY I RECOLLECT PEGGOTTY AND I PEEPING OUT AT THEM FROM MY LITTLE WINDOW I RECOLLECT HOW CLOSELY THEY SEEMED TO BE EXAMINING THE SWEETBRIAR BETWEEN THEM AS THEY STROLLED ALONG AND HOW FROM BEING IN A PERFECTLY ANGELIC TEMPER PEGGOTTY TURNED CROSS IN A MOMENT AND BRUSHED MY HAIR THE WRONG WAY EXCESSIVELY HARD MR MURDSTONE AND I WERE SOON OFF AND TROTTING ALONG ON THE GREEN TURF BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD HE HELD ME QUITE EASILY WITH ONE ARM AND I DONT THINK I WAS RESTLESS USUALLY BUT I COULD NOT MAKE UP MY MIND TO SIT IN FRONT OF HIM WITHOUT TURNING MY HEAD SOMETIMES AND LOOKING UP IN HIS FACE HE HAD THAT KIND OF SHALLOW BLACK EYEI WANT A BETTER WORD TO EXPRESS AN EYE THAT HAS NO DEPTH IN IT TO BE LOOKED INTOWHICH WHEN IT IS ABSTRACTED SEEMS FROM SOME PECULIARITY OF LIGHT TO BE DISFIGURED FOR A MOMENT AT A TIME BY A CAST SEVERAL TIMES WHEN I GLANCED AT HIM I OBSERVED THAT APPEARANCE WITH A SORT OF AWE AND WONDERED WHAT HE WAS THINKING ABOUT SO CLOSELY HIS HAIR AND WHISKERS WERE BLACKER AND THICKER LOOKED AT SO NEAR THAN EVEN I HAD GIVEN THEM CREDIT FOR BEING A SQUARENESS ABOUT THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE AND THE DOTTED INDICATION OF THE STRONG BLACK BEARD HE SHAVED CLOSE EVERY DAY REMINDED ME OF THE WAXWORK THAT HAD TRAVELLED INTO OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD SOME HALFAYEAR BEFORE THIS HIS REGULAR EYEBROWS AND THE RICH WHITE AND BLACK AND BROWN OF HIS COMPLEXIONCONFOUND HIS COMPLEXION AND HIS MEMORYMADE ME THINK HIM IN SPITE OF MY MISGIVINGS A VERY HANDSOME MAN I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT MY POOR DEAR MOTHER THOUGHT HIM SO TOO WE WENT TO AN HOTEL BY THE SEA WHERE TWO GENTLEMEN WERE SMOKING CIGARS IN A ROOM BY THEMSELVES EACH OF THEM WAS LYING ON AT LEAST FOUR CHAIRS AND HAD A LARGE ROUGH JACKET ON IN A CORNER WAS A HEAP OF COATS AND BOATCLOAKS AND A FLAG ALL BUNDLED UP TOGETHER THEY BOTH ROLLED ON TO THEIR FEET IN AN UNTIDY SORT OF MANNER WHEN WE CAME IN AND SAID HALLOA MURDSTONE WE THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD NOT YET SAID MR MURDSTONE AND WHOS THIS SHAVER SAID ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN TAKING HOLD OF ME THATS DAVY RETURNED MR MURDSTONE DAVY WHO SAID THE GENTLEMAN JONES COPPERFIELD SAID MR MURDSTONE WHAT BEWITCHING MRS COPPERFIELDS ENCUMBRANCE CRIED THE GENTLEMAN THE PRETTY LITTLE WIDOW QUINION SAID MR MURDSTONE TAKE CARE IF YOU PLEASE SOMEBODYS SHARP WHO IS ASKED THE GENTLEMAN LAUGHING I LOOKED UP QUICKLY BEING CURIOUS TO KNOW ONLY BROOKS OF SHEFFIELD SAID MR MURDSTONE I WAS QUITE RELIEVED TO FIND THAT IT WAS ONLY BROOKS OF SHEFFIELD FOR AT FIRST I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS I THERE SEEMED TO BE SOMETHING VERY COMICAL IN THE REPUTATION OF MR BROOKS OF SHEFFIELD FOR BOTH THE GENTLEMEN LAUGHED HEARTILY WHEN HE WAS MENTIONED AND MR MURDSTONE WAS A GOOD DEAL AMUSED ALSO AFTER SOME LAUGHING THE GENTLEMAN WHOM HE HAD CALLED QUINION SAID AND WHAT IS THE OPINION OF BROOKS OF SHEFFIELD IN REFERENCE TO THE PROJECTED BUSINESS WHY I DONT KNOW THAT BROOKS UNDERSTANDS MUCH ABOUT IT AT PRESENT REPLIED MR MURDSTONE BUT HE IS NOT GENERALLY FAVOURABLE I BELIEVE THERE WAS MORE LAUGHTER AT THIS AND MR QUINION SAID HE WOULD RING THE BELL FOR SOME SHERRY IN WHICH TO DRINK TO BROOKS THIS HE DID AND WHEN THE WINE CAME HE MADE ME HAVE A LITTLE WITH A BISCUIT AND BEFORE I DRANK IT STAND UP AND SAY CONFUSION TO BROOKS OF SHEFFIELD THE TOAST WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT APPLAUSE AND SUCH HEARTY LAUGHTER THAT IT MADE ME LAUGH TOO AT WHICH THEY LAUGHED THE MORE IN SHORT WE QUITE ENJOYED OURSELVES WE WALKED ABOUT ON THE CLIFF AFTER THAT AND SAT ON THE GRASS AND LOOKED AT THINGS THROUGH A TELESCOPEI COULD MAKE OUT NOTHING MYSELF WHEN IT WAS PUT TO MY EYE BUT I PRETENDED I COULDAND THEN WE CAME BACK TO THE HOTEL TO AN EARLY DINNER ALL THE TIME WE WERE OUT THE TWO GENTLEMEN SMOKED INCESSANTLYWHICH I THOUGHT IF I MIGHT JUDGE FROM THE SMELL OF THEIR ROUGH COATS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN DOING EVER SINCE THE COATS HAD FIRST COME HOME FROM THE TAILORS I MUST NOT FORGET THAT WE WENT ON BOARD THE YACHT WHERE THEY ALL THREE DESCENDED INTO THE CABIN AND WERE BUSY WITH SOME PAPERS I SAW THEM QUITE HARD AT WORK WHEN I LOOKED DOWN THROUGH THE OPEN SKYLIGHT THEY LEFT ME DURING THIS TIME WITH A VERY NICE MAN WITH A VERY LARGE HEAD OF RED HAIR AND A VERY SMALL SHINY HAT UPON IT WHO HAD GOT A CROSSBARRED SHIRT OR WAISTCOAT ON WITH SKYLARK IN CAPITAL LETTERS ACROSS THE CHEST I THOUGHT IT WAS HIS NAME AND THAT AS HE LIVED ON BOARD SHIP AND HADNT A STREET DOOR TO PUT HIS NAME ON HE PUT IT THERE INSTEAD BUT WHEN I CALLED HIM MR SKYLARK HE SAID IT MEANT THE VESSEL I OBSERVED ALL DAY THAT MR MURDSTONE WAS GRAVER AND STEADIER THAN THE TWO GENTLEMEN THEY WERE VERY GAY AND CARELESS THEY JOKED FREELY WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT SELDOM WITH HIM IT APPEARED TO ME THAT HE WAS MORE CLEVER AND COLD THAN THEY WERE AND THAT THEY REGARDED HIM WITH SOMETHING OF MY OWN FEELING I REMARKED THAT ONCE OR TWICE WHEN MR QUINION WAS TALKING HE LOOKED AT MR MURDSTONE SIDEWAYS AS IF TO MAKE SURE OF HIS NOT BEING DISPLEASED AND THAT ONCE WHEN MR PASSNIDGE THE OTHER GENTLEMAN WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS HE TROD UPON HIS FOOT AND GAVE HIM A SECRET CAUTION WITH HIS EYES TO OBSERVE MR MURDSTONE WHO WAS SITTING STERN AND SILENT NOR DO I RECOLLECT THAT MR MURDSTONE LAUGHED AT ALL THAT DAY EXCEPT AT THE SHEFFIELD JOKEAND THAT BY THE BY WAS HIS OWN WE WENT HOME EARLY IN THE EVENING IT WAS A VERY FINE EVENING AND MY MOTHER AND HE HAD ANOTHER STROLL BY THE SWEETBRIAR WHILE I WAS SENT IN TO GET MY TEA WHEN HE WAS GONE MY MOTHER ASKED ME ALL ABOUT THE DAY I HAD HAD AND WHAT THEY HAD SAID AND DONE I MENTIONED WHAT THEY HAD SAID ABOUT HER AND SHE LAUGHED AND TOLD ME THEY WERE IMPUDENT FELLOWS WHO TALKED NONSENSEBUT I KNEW IT PLEASED HER I KNEW IT QUITE AS WELL AS I KNOW IT NOW I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING IF SHE WAS AT ALL ACQUAINTED WITH MR BROOKS OF SHEFFIELD BUT SHE ANSWERED NO ONLY SHE SUPPOSED HE MUST BE A MANUFACTURER IN THE KNIFE AND FORK WAY CAN I SAY OF HER FACEALTERED AS I HAVE REASON TO REMEMBER IT PERISHED AS I KNOW IT ISTHAT IT IS GONE WHEN HERE IT COMES BEFORE ME AT THIS INSTANT AS DISTINCT AS ANY FACE THAT I MAY CHOOSE TO LOOK ON IN A CROWDED STREET CAN I SAY OF HER INNOCENT AND GIRLISH BEAUTY THAT IT FADED AND WAS NO MORE WHEN ITS BREATH FALLS ON MY CHEEK NOW AS IT FELL THAT NIGHT CAN I SAY SHE EVER CHANGED WHEN MY REMEMBRANCE BRINGS HER BACK TO LIFE THUS ONLY AND TRUER TO ITS LOVING YOUTH THAN I HAVE BEEN OR MAN EVER IS STILL HOLDS FAST WHAT IT CHERISHED THEN I WRITE OF HER JUST AS SHE WAS WHEN I HAD GONE TO BED AFTER THIS TALK AND SHE CAME TO BID ME GOOD NIGHT SHE KNEELED DOWN PLAYFULLY BY THE SIDE OF THE BED AND LAYING HER CHIN UPON HER HANDS AND LAUGHING SAID WHAT WAS IT THEY SAID DAVY TELL ME AGAIN I CANT BELIEVE IT BEWITCHING I BEGAN MY MOTHER PUT HER HANDS UPON MY LIPS TO STOP ME IT WAS NEVER BEWITCHING SHE SAID LAUGHING IT NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN BEWITCHING DAVY NOW I KNOW IT WASNT YES IT WAS BEWITCHING MRS COPPERFIELD I REPEATED STOUTLY AND PRETTY NO NO IT WAS NEVER PRETTY NOT PRETTY INTERPOSED MY MOTHER LAYING HER FINGERS ON MY LIPS AGAIN YES IT WAS PRETTY LITTLE WIDOW WHAT FOOLISH IMPUDENT CREATURES CRIED MY MOTHER LAUGHING AND COVERING HER FACE WHAT RIDICULOUS MEN ANT THEY DAVY DEAR WELL MA DONT TELL PEGGOTTY SHE MIGHT BE ANGRY WITH THEM I AM DREADFULLY ANGRY WITH THEM MYSELF BUT I WOULD RATHER PEGGOTTY DIDNT KNOW I PROMISED OF COURSE AND WE KISSED ONE ANOTHER OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP IT SEEMS TO ME AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME AS IF IT WERE THE NEXT DAY WHEN PEGGOTTY BROACHED THE STRIKING AND ADVENTUROUS PROPOSITION I AM ABOUT TO MENTION BUT IT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTERWARDS WE WERE SITTING AS BEFORE ONE EVENING WHEN MY MOTHER WAS OUT AS BEFORE IN COMPANY WITH THE STOCKING AND THE YARDMEASURE AND THE BIT OF WAX AND THE BOX WITH ST PAULS ON THE LID AND THE CROCODILE BOOK WHEN PEGGOTTY AFTER LOOKING AT ME SEVERAL TIMES AND OPENING HER MOUTH AS IF SHE WERE GOING TO SPEAK WITHOUT DOING ITWHICH I THOUGHT WAS MERELY GAPING OR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER ALARMEDSAID COAXINGLY MASTER DAVY HOW SHOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ALONG WITH ME AND SPEND A FORTNIGHT AT MY BROTHERS AT YARMOUTH WOULDNT THAT BE A TREAT IS YOUR BROTHER AN AGREEABLE MAN PEGGOTTY I INQUIRED PROVISIONALLY OH WHAT AN AGREEABLE MAN HE IS CRIED PEGGOTTY HOLDING UP HER HANDS THEN THERES THE SEA AND THE BOATS AND SHIPS AND THE FISHERMEN AND THE BEACH AND AM TO PLAY WITH PEGGOTTY MEANT HER NEPHEW HAM MENTIONED IN MY FIRST CHAPTER BUT SHE SPOKE OF HIM AS A MORSEL OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR I WAS FLUSHED BY HER SUMMARY OF DELIGHTS AND REPLIED THAT IT WOULD INDEED BE A TREAT BUT WHAT WOULD MY MOTHER SAY WHY THEN ILL AS GOOD AS BET A GUINEA SAID PEGGOTTY INTENT UPON MY FACE THAT SHELL LET US GO ILL ASK HER IF YOU LIKE AS SOON AS EVER SHE COMES HOME THERE NOW BUT WHATS SHE TO DO WHILE WERE AWAY SAID I PUTTING MY SMALL ELBOWS ON THE TABLE TO ARGUE THE POINT SHE CANT LIVE BY HERSELF IF PEGGOTTY WERE LOOKING FOR A HOLE ALL OF A SUDDEN IN THE HEEL OF THAT STOCKING IT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY LITTLE ONE INDEED AND NOT WORTH DARNING I SAY PEGGOTTY SHE CANT LIVE BY HERSELF YOU KNOW OH BLESS YOU SAID PEGGOTTY LOOKING AT ME AGAIN AT LAST DONT YOU KNOW SHES GOING TO STAY FOR A FORTNIGHT WITH MRS GRAYPER MRS GRAYPERS GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF COMPANY OH IF THAT WAS IT I WAS QUITE READY TO GO I WAITED IN THE UTMOST IMPATIENCE UNTIL MY MOTHER CAME HOME FROM MRS GRAYPERS FOR IT WAS THAT IDENTICAL NEIGHBOUR TO ASCERTAIN IF WE COULD GET LEAVE TO CARRY OUT THIS GREAT IDEA WITHOUT BEING NEARLY SO MUCH SURPRISED AS I HAD EXPECTED MY MOTHER ENTERED INTO IT READILY AND IT WAS ALL ARRANGED THAT NIGHT AND MY BOARD AND LODGING DURING THE VISIT WERE TO BE PAID FOR THE DAY SOON CAME FOR OUR GOING IT WAS SUCH AN EARLY DAY THAT IT CAME SOON EVEN TO ME WHO WAS IN A FEVER OF EXPECTATION AND HALF AFRAID THAT AN EARTHQUAKE OR A FIERY MOUNTAIN OR SOME OTHER GREAT CONVULSION OF NATURE MIGHT INTERPOSE TO STOP THE EXPEDITION WE WERE TO GO IN A CARRIERS CART WHICH DEPARTED IN THE MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANY MONEY TO HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO WRAP MYSELF UP OVERNIGHT AND SLEEP IN MY HAT AND BOOTS IT TOUCHES ME NEARLY NOW ALTHOUGH I TELL IT LIGHTLY TO RECOLLECT HOW EAGER I WAS TO LEAVE MY HAPPY HOME TO THINK HOW LITTLE I SUSPECTED WHAT I DID LEAVE FOR EVER I AM GLAD TO RECOLLECT THAT WHEN THE CARRIERS CART WAS AT THE GATE AND MY MOTHER STOOD THERE KISSING ME A GRATEFUL FONDNESS FOR HER AND FOR THE OLD PLACE I HAD NEVER TURNED MY BACK UPON BEFORE MADE ME CRY I AM GLAD TO KNOW THAT MY MOTHER CRIED TOO AND THAT I FELT HER HEART BEAT AGAINST MINE I AM GLAD TO RECOLLECT THAT WHEN THE CARRIER BEGAN TO MOVE MY MOTHER RAN OUT AT THE GATE AND CALLED TO HIM TO STOP THAT SHE MIGHT KISS ME ONCE MORE I AM GLAD TO DWELL UPON THE EARNESTNESS AND LOVE WITH WHICH SHE LIFTED UP HER FACE TO MINE AND DID SO AS WE LEFT HER STANDING IN THE ROAD MR MURDSTONE CAME UP TO WHERE SHE WAS AND SEEMED TO EXPOSTULATE WITH HER FOR BEING SO MOVED I WAS LOOKING BACK ROUND THE AWNING OF THE CART AND WONDERED WHAT BUSINESS IT WAS OF HIS PEGGOTTY WHO WAS ALSO LOOKING BACK ON THE OTHER SIDE SEEMED ANYTHING BUT SATISFIED AS THE FACE SHE BROUGHT BACK IN THE CART DENOTED I SAT LOOKING AT PEGGOTTY FOR SOME TIME IN A REVERIE ON THIS SUPPOSITITIOUS CASE WHETHER IF SHE WERE EMPLOYED TO LOSE ME LIKE THE BOY IN THE FAIRY TALE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRACK MY WAY HOME AGAIN BY THE BUTTONS SHE WOULD SHED CHAPTER I HAVE A CHANGE THE CARRIERS HORSE WAS THE LAZIEST HORSE IN THE WORLD I SHOULD HOPE AND SHUFFLED ALONG WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AS IF HE LIKED TO KEEP PEOPLE WAITING TO WHOM THE PACKAGES WERE DIRECTED I FANCIED INDEED THAT HE SOMETIMES CHUCKLED AUDIBLY OVER THIS REFLECTION BUT THE CARRIER SAID HE WAS ONLY TROUBLED WITH A COUGH THE CARRIER HAD A WAY OF KEEPING HIS HEAD DOWN LIKE HIS HORSE AND OF DROOPING SLEEPILY FORWARD AS HE DROVE WITH ONE OF HIS ARMS ON EACH OF HIS KNEES I SAY DROVE BUT IT STRUCK ME THAT THE CART WOULD HAVE GONE TO YARMOUTH QUITE AS WELL WITHOUT HIM FOR THE HORSE DID ALL THAT AND AS TO CONVERSATION HE HAD NO IDEA OF IT BUT WHISTLING PEGGOTTY HAD A BASKET OF REFRESHMENTS ON HER KNEE WHICH WOULD HAVE LASTED US OUT HANDSOMELY IF WE HAD BEEN GOING TO LONDON BY THE SAME CONVEYANCE WE ATE A GOOD DEAL AND SLEPT A GOOD DEAL PEGGOTTY ALWAYS WENT TO SLEEP WITH HER CHIN UPON THE HANDLE OF THE BASKET HER HOLD OF WHICH NEVER RELAXED AND I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED UNLESS I HAD HEARD HER DO IT THAT ONE DEFENCELESS WOMAN COULD HAVE SNORED SO MUCH WE MADE SO MANY DEVIATIONS UP AND DOWN LANES AND WERE SUCH A LONG TIME DELIVERING A BEDSTEAD AT A PUBLICHOUSE AND CALLING AT OTHER PLACES THAT I WAS QUITE TIRED AND VERY GLAD WHEN WE SAW YARMOUTH IT LOOKED RATHER SPONGY AND SOPPY I THOUGHT AS I CARRIED MY EYE OVER THE GREAT DULL WASTE THAT LAY ACROSS THE RIVER AND I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING IF THE WORLD WERE REALLY AS ROUND AS MY GEOGRAPHY BOOK SAID HOW ANY PART OF IT CAME TO BE SO FLAT BUT I REFLECTED THAT YARMOUTH MIGHT BE SITUATED AT ONE OF THE POLES WHICH WOULD ACCOUNT FOR IT AS WE DREW A LITTLE NEARER AND SAW THE WHOLE ADJACENT PROSPECT LYING A STRAIGHT LOW LINE UNDER THE SKY I HINTED TO PEGGOTTY THAT A MOUND OR SO MIGHT HAVE IMPROVED IT AND ALSO THAT IF THE LAND HAD BEEN A LITTLE MORE SEPARATED FROM THE SEA AND THE TOWN AND THE TIDE HAD NOT BEEN QUITE SO MUCH MIXED UP LIKE TOAST AND WATER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICER BUT PEGGOTTY SAID WITH GREATER EMPHASIS THAN USUAL THAT WE MUST TAKE THINGS AS WE FOUND THEM AND THAT FOR HER PART SHE WAS PROUD TO CALL HERSELF A YARMOUTH BLOATER WHEN WE GOT INTO THE STREET WHICH WAS STRANGE ENOUGH TO ME AND SMELT THE FISH AND PITCH AND OAKUM AND TAR AND SAW THE SAILORS WALKING ABOUT AND THE CARTS JINGLING UP AND DOWN OVER THE STONES I FELT THAT I HAD DONE SO BUSY A PLACE AN INJUSTICE AND SAID AS MUCH TO PEGGOTTY WHO HEARD MY EXPRESSIONS OF DELIGHT WITH GREAT COMPLACENCY AND TOLD ME IT WAS WELL KNOWN I SUPPOSE TO THOSE WHO HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO BE BORN BLOATERS THAT YARMOUTH WAS UPON THE WHOLE THE FINEST PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE HERES MY AM SCREAMED PEGGOTTY GROWED OUT OF KNOWLEDGE HE WAS WAITING FOR US IN FACT AT THE PUBLICHOUSE AND ASKED ME HOW I FOUND MYSELF LIKE AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE I DID NOT FEEL AT FIRST THAT I KNEW HIM AS WELL AS HE KNEW ME BECAUSE HE HAD NEVER COME TO OUR HOUSE SINCE THE NIGHT I WAS BORN AND NATURALLY HE HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF ME BUT OUR INTIMACY WAS MUCH ADVANCED BY HIS TAKING ME ON HIS BACK TO CARRY ME HOME HE WAS NOW A HUGE STRONG FELLOW OF SIX FEET HIGH BROAD IN PROPORTION AND ROUNDSHOULDERED BUT WITH A SIMPERING BOYS FACE AND CURLY LIGHT HAIR THAT GAVE HIM QUITE A SHEEPISH LOOK HE WAS DRESSED IN A CANVAS JACKET AND A PAIR OF SUCH VERY STIFF TROUSERS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE STOOD QUITE AS WELL ALONE WITHOUT ANY LEGS IN THEM AND YOU COULDNT SO PROPERLY HAVE SAID HE WORE A HAT AS THAT HE WAS COVERED IN ATOP LIKE AN OLD BUILDING WITH SOMETHING PITCHY HAM CARRYING ME ON HIS BACK AND A SMALL BOX OF OURS UNDER HIS ARM AND PEGGOTTY CARRYING ANOTHER SMALL BOX OF OURS WE TURNED DOWN LANES BESTREWN WITH BITS OF CHIPS AND LITTLE HILLOCKS OF SAND AND WENT PAST GASWORKS ROPEWALKS BOATBUILDERS YARDS SHIPWRIGHTS YARDS SHIPBREAKERS YARDS CAULKERS YARDS RIGGERS LOFTS SMITHS FORGES AND A GREAT LITTER OF SUCH PLACES UNTIL WE CAME OUT UPON THE DULL WASTE I HAD ALREADY SEEN AT A DISTANCE WHEN HAM SAID YONS OUR HOUSE MASR DAVY I LOOKED IN ALL DIRECTIONS AS FAR AS I COULD STARE OVER THE WILDERNESS AND AWAY AT THE SEA AND AWAY AT THE RIVER BUT NO HOUSE COULD I MAKE OUT THERE WAS A BLACK BARGE OR SOME OTHER KIND OF SUPERANNUATED BOAT NOT FAR OFF HIGH AND DRY ON THE GROUND WITH AN IRON FUNNEL STICKING OUT OF IT FOR A CHIMNEY AND SMOKING VERY COSILY BUT NOTHING ELSE IN THE WAY OF A HABITATION THAT WAS VISIBLE TO ME THATS NOT IT SAID I THAT SHIPLOOKING THING THATS IT MASR DAVY RETURNED HAM IF IT HAD BEEN ALADDINS PALACE ROCS EGG AND ALL I SUPPOSE I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE CHARMED WITH THE ROMANTIC IDEA OF LIVING IN IT THERE WAS A DELIGHTFUL DOOR CUT IN THE SIDE AND IT WAS ROOFED IN AND THERE WERE LITTLE WINDOWS IN IT BUT THE WONDERFUL CHARM OF IT WAS THAT IT WAS A REAL BOAT WHICH HAD NO DOUBT BEEN UPON THE WATER HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN INTENDED TO BE LIVED IN ON DRY LAND THAT WAS THE CAPTIVATION OF IT TO ME IF IT HAD EVER BEEN MEANT TO BE LIVED IN I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT IT SMALL OR INCONVENIENT OR LONELY BUT NEVER HAVING BEEN DESIGNED FOR ANY SUCH USE IT BECAME A PERFECT ABODE IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY CLEAN INSIDE AND AS TIDY AS POSSIBLE THERE WAS A TABLE AND A DUTCH CLOCK AND A CHEST OF DRAWERS AND ON THE CHEST OF DRAWERS THERE WAS A TEATRAY WITH A PAINTING ON IT OF A LADY WITH A PARASOL TAKING A WALK WITH A MILITARYLOOKING CHILD WHO WAS TRUNDLING A HOOP THE TRAY WAS KEPT FROM TUMBLING DOWN BY A BIBLE AND THE TRAY IF IT HAD TUMBLED DOWN WOULD HAVE SMASHED A QUANTITY OF CUPS AND SAUCERS AND A TEAPOT THAT WERE GROUPED AROUND THE BOOK ON THE WALLS THERE WERE SOME COMMON COLOURED PICTURES FRAMED AND GLAZED OF SCRIPTURE SUBJECTS SUCH AS I HAVE NEVER SEEN SINCE IN THE HANDS OF PEDLARS WITHOUT SEEING THE WHOLE INTERIOR OF PEGGOTTYS BROTHERS HOUSE AGAIN AT ONE VIEW ABRAHAM IN RED GOING TO SACRIFICE ISAAC IN BLUE AND DANIEL IN YELLOW CAST INTO A DEN OF GREEN LIONS WERE THE MOST PROMINENT OF THESE OVER THE LITTLE MANTELSHELF WAS A PICTURE OF THE SARAH JANE LUGGER BUILT AT SUNDERLAND WITH A REAL LITTLE WOODEN STERN STUCK ON TO IT A WORK OF ART COMBINING COMPOSITION WITH CARPENTRY WHICH I CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST ENVIABLE POSSESSIONS THAT THE WORLD COULD AFFORD THERE WERE SOME HOOKS IN THE BEAMS OF THE CEILING THE USE OF WHICH I DID NOT DIVINE THEN AND SOME LOCKERS AND BOXES AND CONVENIENCES OF THAT SORT WHICH SERVED FOR SEATS AND EKED OUT THE CHAIRS ALL THIS I SAW IN THE FIRST GLANCE AFTER I CROSSED THE THRESHOLDCHILDLIKE ACCORDING TO MY THEORYAND THEN PEGGOTTY OPENED A LITTLE DOOR AND SHOWED ME MY BEDROOM IT WAS THE COMPLETEST AND MOST DESIRABLE BEDROOM EVER SEENIN THE STERN OF THE VESSEL WITH A LITTLE WINDOW WHERE THE RUDDER USED TO GO THROUGH A LITTLE LOOKINGGLASS JUST THE RIGHT HEIGHT FOR ME NAILED AGAINST THE WALL AND FRAMED WITH OYSTERSHELLS A LITTLE BED WHICH THERE WAS JUST ROOM ENOUGH TO GET INTO AND A NOSEGAY OF SEAWEED IN A BLUE MUG ON THE TABLE THE WALLS WERE WHITEWASHED AS WHITE AS MILK AND THE PATCHWORK COUNTERPANE MADE MY EYES QUITE ACHE WITH ITS BRIGHTNESS ONE THING I PARTICULARLY NOTICED IN THIS DELIGHTFUL HOUSE WAS THE SMELL OF FISH WHICH WAS SO SEARCHING THAT WHEN I TOOK OUT MY POCKETHANDKERCHIEF TO WIPE MY NOSE I FOUND IT SMELT EXACTLY AS IF IT HAD WRAPPED UP A LOBSTER ON MY IMPARTING THIS DISCOVERY IN CONFIDENCE TO PEGGOTTY SHE INFORMED ME THAT HER BROTHER DEALT IN LOBSTERS CRABS AND CRAWFISH AND I AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT A HEAP OF THESE CREATURES IN A STATE OF WONDERFUL CONGLOMERATION WITH ONE ANOTHER AND NEVER LEAVING OFF PINCHING WHATEVER THEY LAID HOLD OF WERE USUALLY TO BE FOUND IN A LITTLE WOODEN OUTHOUSE WHERE THE POTS AND KETTLES WERE KEPT WE WERE WELCOMED BY A VERY CIVIL WOMAN IN A WHITE APRON WHOM I HAD SEEN CURTSEYING AT THE DOOR WHEN I WAS ON HAMS BACK ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE OFF LIKEWISE BY A MOST BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL OR I THOUGHT HER SO WITH A NECKLACE OF BLUE BEADS ON WHO WOULDNT LET ME KISS HER WHEN I OFFERED TO BUT RAN AWAY AND HID HERSELF BY AND BY WHEN WE HAD DINED IN A SUMPTUOUS MANNER OFF BOILED DABS MELTED BUTTER AND POTATOES WITH A CHOP FOR ME A HAIRY MAN WITH A VERY GOODNATURED FACE CAME HOME AS HE CALLED PEGGOTTY LASS AND GAVE HER A HEARTY SMACK ON THE CHEEK I HAD NO DOUBT FROM THE GENERAL PROPRIETY OF HER CONDUCT THAT HE WAS HER BROTHER AND SO HE TURNED OUTBEING PRESENTLY INTRODUCED TO ME AS MR PEGGOTTY THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE GLAD TO SEE YOU SIR SAID MR PEGGOTTY YOULL FIND US ROUGH SIR BUT YOULL FIND US READY I THANKED HIM AND REPLIED THAT I WAS SURE I SHOULD BE HAPPY IN SUCH A DELIGHTFUL PLACE HOWS YOUR MA SIR SAID MR PEGGOTTY DID YOU LEAVE HER PRETTY JOLLY I GAVE MR PEGGOTTY TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS AS JOLLY AS I COULD WISH AND THAT SHE DESIRED HER COMPLIMENTSWHICH WAS A POLITE FICTION ON MY PART IM MUCH OBLEEGED TO HER IM SURE SAID MR PEGGOTTY WELL SIR IF YOU CAN MAKE OUT HERE FUR A FORTNUT LONG WI HER NODDING AT HIS SISTER AND HAM AND LITTLE EMLY WE SHALL BE PROUD OF YOUR COMPANY HAVING DONE THE HONOURS OF HIS HOUSE IN THIS HOSPITABLE MANNER MR PEGGOTTY WENT OUT TO WASH HIMSELF IN A KETTLEFUL OF HOT WATER REMARKING THAT COLD WOULD NEVER GET HIS MUCK OFF HE SOON RETURNED GREATLY IMPROVED IN APPEARANCE BUT SO RUBICUND THAT I COULDNT HELP THINKING HIS FACE HAD THIS IN COMMON WITH THE LOBSTERS CRABS AND CRAWFISHTHAT IT WENT INTO THE HOT WATER VERY BLACK AND CAME OUT VERY RED AFTER TEA WHEN THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND ALL WAS MADE SNUG THE NIGHTS BEING COLD AND MISTY NOW IT SEEMED TO ME THE MOST DELICIOUS RETREAT THAT THE IMAGINATION OF MAN COULD CONCEIVE TO HEAR THE WIND GETTING UP OUT AT SEA TO KNOW THAT THE FOG WAS CREEPING OVER THE DESOLATE FLAT OUTSIDE AND TO LOOK AT THE FIRE AND THINK THAT THERE WAS NO HOUSE NEAR BUT THIS ONE AND THIS ONE A BOAT WAS LIKE ENCHANTMENT LITTLE EMLY HAD OVERCOME HER SHYNESS AND WAS SITTING BY MY SIDE UPON THE LOWEST AND LEAST OF THE LOCKERS WHICH WAS JUST LARGE ENOUGH FOR US TWO AND JUST FITTED INTO THE CHIMNEY CORNER MRS PEGGOTTY WITH THE WHITE APRON WAS KNITTING ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE FIRE PEGGOTTY AT HER NEEDLEWORK WAS AS MUCH AT HOME WITH ST PAULS AND THE BIT OF WAXCANDLE AS IF THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN ANY OTHER ROOF HAM WHO HAD BEEN GIVING ME MY FIRST LESSON IN ALLFOURS WAS TRYING TO RECOLLECT A SCHEME OF TELLING FORTUNES WITH THE DIRTY CARDS AND WAS PRINTING OFF FISHY IMPRESSIONS OF HIS THUMB ON ALL THE CARDS HE TURNED MR PEGGOTTY WAS SMOKING HIS PIPE I FELT IT WAS A TIME FOR CONVERSATION AND CONFIDENCE MR PEGGOTTY SAYS I SIR SAYS HE DID YOU GIVE YOUR SON THE NAME OF HAM BECAUSE YOU LIVED IN A SORT OF ARK MR PEGGOTTY SEEMED TO THINK IT A DEEP IDEA BUT ANSWERED NO SIR I NEVER GIV HIM NO NAME WHO GAVE HIM THAT NAME THEN SAID I PUTTING QUESTION NUMBER TWO OF THE CATECHISM TO MR PEGGOTTY WHY SIR HIS FATHER GIV IT HIM SAID MR PEGGOTTY I THOUGHT YOU WERE HIS FATHER MY BROTHER JOE WAS HIS FATHER SAID MR PEGGOTTY DEAD MR PEGGOTTY I HINTED AFTER A RESPECTFUL PAUSE DROWNDEAD SAID MR PEGGOTTY I WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED THAT MR PEGGOTTY WAS NOT HAMS FATHER AND BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER I WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP TO ANYBODY ELSE THERE I WAS SO CURIOUS TO KNOW THAT I MADE UP MY MIND TO HAVE IT OUT WITH MR PEGGOTTY LITTLE EMLY I SAID GLANCING AT HER SHE IS YOUR DAUGHTER ISNT SHE MR PEGGOTTY NO SIR MY BROTHERINLAW TOM WAS HER FATHER I COULDNT HELP IT DEAD MR PEGGOTTY I HINTED AFTER ANOTHER RESPECTFUL SILENCE DROWNDEAD SAID MR PEGGOTTY I FELT THE DIFFICULTY OF RESUMING THE SUBJECT BUT HAD NOT GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF IT YET AND MUST GET TO THE BOTTOM SOMEHOW SO I SAID HAVENT YOU ANY CHILDREN MR PEGGOTTY NO MASTER HE ANSWERED WITH A SHORT LAUGH IM A BACHELDORE A BACHELOR I SAID ASTONISHED WHY WHOS THAT MR PEGGOTTY POINTING TO THE PERSON IN THE APRON WHO WAS KNITTING THATS MISSIS GUMMIDGE SAID MR PEGGOTTY GUMMIDGE MR PEGGOTTY BUT AT THIS POINT PEGGOTTYI MEAN MY OWN PECULIAR PEGGOTTYMADE SUCH IMPRESSIVE MOTIONS TO ME NOT TO ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS THAT I COULD ONLY SIT AND LOOK AT ALL THE SILENT COMPANY UNTIL IT WAS TIME TO GO TO BED THEN IN THE PRIVACY OF MY OWN LITTLE CABIN SHE INFORMED ME THAT HAM AND EMLY WERE AN ORPHAN NEPHEW AND NIECE WHOM MY HOST HAD AT DIFFERENT TIMES ADOPTED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD WHEN THEY WERE LEFT DESTITUTE AND THAT MRS GUMMIDGE WAS THE WIDOW OF HIS PARTNER IN A BOAT WHO HAD DIED VERY POOR HE WAS BUT A POOR MAN HIMSELF SAID PEGGOTTY BUT AS GOOD AS GOLD AND AS TRUE AS STEELTHOSE WERE HER SIMILES THE ONLY SUBJECT SHE INFORMED ME ON WHICH HE EVER SHOWED A VIOLENT TEMPER OR SWORE AN OATH WAS THIS GENEROSITY OF HIS AND IF IT WERE EVER REFERRED TO BY ANY ONE OF THEM HE STRUCK THE TABLE A HEAVY BLOW WITH HIS RIGHT HAND HAD SPLIT IT ON ONE SUCH OCCASION AND SWORE A DREADFUL OATH THAT HE WOULD BE GORMED IF HE DIDNT CUT AND RUN FOR GOOD IF IT WAS EVER MENTIONED AGAIN IT APPEARED IN ANSWER TO MY INQUIRIES THAT NOBODY HAD THE LEAST IDEA OF THE ETYMOLOGY OF THIS TERRIBLE VERB PASSIVE TO BE GORMED BUT THAT THEY ALL REGARDED IT AS CONSTITUTING A MOST SOLEMN IMPRECATION I WAS VERY SENSIBLE OF MY ENTERTAINERS GOODNESS AND LISTENED TO THE WOMENS GOING TO BED IN ANOTHER LITTLE CRIB LIKE MINE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE BOAT AND TO HIM AND HAM HANGING UP TWO HAMMOCKS FOR THEMSELVES ON THE HOOKS I HAD NOTICED IN THE ROOF IN A VERY LUXURIOUS STATE OF MIND ENHANCED BY MY BEING SLEEPY AS SLUMBER GRADUALLY STOLE UPON ME I HEARD THE WIND HOWLING OUT AT SEA AND COMING ON ACROSS THE FLAT SO FIERCELY THAT I HAD A LAZY APPREHENSION OF THE GREAT DEEP RISING IN THE NIGHT BUT I BETHOUGHT MYSELF THAT I WAS IN A BOAT AFTER ALL AND THAT A MAN LIKE MR PEGGOTTY WAS NOT A BAD PERSON TO HAVE ON BOARD IF ANYTHING DID HAPPEN NOTHING HAPPENED HOWEVER WORSE THAN MORNING ALMOST AS SOON AS IT SHONE UPON THE OYSTERSHELL FRAME OF MY MIRROR I WAS OUT OF BED AND OUT WITH LITTLE EMLY PICKING UP STONES UPON THE BEACH YOURE QUITE A SAILOR I SUPPOSE I SAID TO EMLY I DONT KNOW THAT I SUPPOSED ANYTHING OF THE KIND BUT I FELT IT AN ACT OF GALLANTRY TO SAY SOMETHING AND A SHINING SAIL CLOSE TO US MADE SUCH A PRETTY LITTLE IMAGE OF ITSELF AT THE MOMENT IN HER BRIGHT EYE THAT IT CAME INTO MY HEAD TO SAY THIS NO REPLIED EMLY SHAKING HER HEAD IM AFRAID OF THE SEA AFRAID I SAID WITH A BECOMING AIR OF BOLDNESS AND LOOKING VERY BIG AT THE MIGHTY OCEAN I ANT AH BUT ITS CRUEL SAID EMLY I HAVE SEEN IT VERY CRUEL TO SOME OF OUR MEN I HAVE SEEN IT TEAR A BOAT AS BIG AS OUR HOUSE ALL TO PIECES I HOPE IT WASNT THE BOAT THAT THAT FATHER WAS DROWNDED IN SAID EMLY NO NOT THAT ONE I NEVER SEE THAT BOAT NOR HIM I ASKED HER LITTLE EMLY SHOOK HER HEAD NOT TO REMEMBER HERE WAS A COINCIDENCE I IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO AN EXPLANATION HOW I HAD NEVER SEEN MY OWN FATHER AND HOW MY MOTHER AND I HAD ALWAYS LIVED BY OURSELVES IN THE HAPPIEST STATE IMAGINABLE AND LIVED SO THEN AND ALWAYS MEANT TO LIVE SO AND HOW MY FATHERS GRAVE WAS IN THE CHURCHYARD NEAR OUR HOUSE AND SHADED BY A TREE BENEATH THE BOUGHS OF WHICH I HAD WALKED AND HEARD THE BIRDS SING MANY A PLEASANT MORNING BUT THERE WERE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EMLYS ORPHANHOOD AND MINE IT APPEARED SHE HAD LOST HER MOTHER BEFORE HER FATHER AND WHERE HER FATHERS GRAVE WAS NO ONE KNEW EXCEPT THAT IT WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA BESIDES SAID EMLY AS SHE LOOKED ABOUT FOR SHELLS AND PEBBLES YOUR FATHER WAS A GENTLEMAN AND YOUR MOTHER IS A LADY AND MY FATHER WAS A FISHERMAN AND MY MOTHER WAS A FISHERMANS DAUGHTER AND MY UNCLE DAN IS A FISHERMAN DAN IS MR PEGGOTTY IS HE SAID I UNCLE DANYONDER ANSWERED EMLY NODDING AT THE BOATHOUSE YES I MEAN HIM HE MUST BE VERY GOOD I SHOULD THINK GOOD SAID EMLY IF I WAS EVER TO BE A LADY ID GIVE HIM A SKYBLUE COAT WITH DIAMOND BUTTONS NANKEEN TROUSERS A RED VELVET WAISTCOAT A COCKED HAT A LARGE GOLD WATCH A SILVER PIPE AND A BOX OF MONEY I SAID I HAD NO DOUBT THAT MR PEGGOTTY WELL DESERVED THESE TREASURES I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I FELT IT DIFFICULT TO PICTURE HIM QUITE AT HIS EASE IN THE RAIMENT PROPOSED FOR HIM BY HIS GRATEFUL LITTLE NIECE AND THAT I WAS PARTICULARLY DOUBTFUL OF THE POLICY OF THE COCKED HAT BUT I KEPT THESE SENTIMENTS TO MYSELF LITTLE EMLY HAD STOPPED AND LOOKED UP AT THE SKY IN HER ENUMERATION OF THESE ARTICLES AS IF THEY WERE A GLORIOUS VISION WE WENT ON AGAIN PICKING UP SHELLS AND PEBBLES YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A LADY I SAID EMILY LOOKED AT ME AND LAUGHED AND NODDED YES I SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH WE WOULD ALL BE GENTLEFOLKS TOGETHER THEN ME AND UNCLE AND HAM AND MRS GUMMIDGE WE WOULDNT MIND THEN WHEN THERE COMES STORMY WEATHERNOT FOR OUR OWN SAKES I MEAN WE WOULD FOR THE POOR FISHERMENS TO BE SURE AND WED HELP EM WITH MONEY WHEN THEY COME TO ANY HURT THIS SEEMED TO ME TO BE A VERY SATISFACTORY AND THEREFORE NOT AT ALL IMPROBABLE PICTURE I EXPRESSED MY PLEASURE IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF IT AND LITTLE EMLY WAS EMBOLDENED TO SAY SHYLY DONT YOU THINK YOU ARE AFRAID OF THE SEA NOW IT WAS QUIET ENOUGH TO REASSURE ME BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT IF I HAD SEEN A MODERATELY LARGE WAVE COME TUMBLING IN I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN TO MY HEELS WITH AN AWFUL RECOLLECTION OF HER DROWNED RELATIONS HOWEVER I SAID NO AND I ADDED YOU DONT SEEM TO BE EITHER THOUGH YOU SAY YOU AREFOR SHE WAS WALKING MUCH TOO NEAR THE BRINK OF A SORT OF OLD JETTY OR WOODEN CAUSEWAY WE HAD STROLLED UPON AND I WAS AFRAID OF HER FALLING OVER IM NOT AFRAID IN THIS WAY SAID LITTLE EMLY BUT I WAKE WHEN IT BLOWS AND TREMBLE TO THINK OF UNCLE DAN AND HAM AND BELIEVE I HEAR EM CRYING OUT FOR HELP THATS WHY I SHOULD LIKE SO MUCH TO BE A LADY BUT IM NOT AFRAID IN THIS WAY NOT A BIT LOOK HERE SHE STARTED FROM MY SIDE AND RAN ALONG A JAGGED TIMBER WHICH PROTRUDED FROM THE PLACE WE STOOD UPON AND OVERHUNG THE DEEP WATER AT SOME HEIGHT WITHOUT THE LEAST DEFENCE THE INCIDENT IS SO IMPRESSED ON MY REMEMBRANCE THAT IF I WERE A DRAUGHTSMAN I COULD DRAW ITS FORM HERE I DARE SAY ACCURATELY AS IT WAS THAT DAY AND LITTLE EMLY SPRINGING FORWARD TO HER DESTRUCTION AS IT APPEARED TO ME WITH A LOOK THAT I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN DIRECTED FAR OUT TO SEA THE LIGHT BOLD FLUTTERING LITTLE FIGURE TURNED AND CAME BACK SAFE TO ME AND I SOON LAUGHED AT MY FEARS AND AT THE CRY I HAD UTTERED FRUITLESSLY IN ANY CASE FOR THERE WAS NO ONE NEAR BUT THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES SINCE IN MY MANHOOD MANY TIMES THERE HAVE BEEN WHEN I HAVE THOUGHT IS IT POSSIBLE AMONG THE POSSIBILITIES OF HIDDEN THINGS THAT IN THE SUDDEN RASHNESS OF THE CHILD AND HER WILD LOOK SO FAR OFF THERE WAS ANY MERCIFUL ATTRACTION OF HER INTO DANGER ANY TEMPTING HER TOWARDS HIM PERMITTED ON THE PART OF HER DEAD FATHER THAT HER LIFE MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE OF ENDING THAT DAY THERE HAS BEEN A TIME SINCE WHEN I HAVE WONDERED WHETHER IF THE LIFE BEFORE HER COULD HAVE BEEN REVEALED TO ME AT A GLANCE AND SO REVEALED AS THAT A CHILD COULD FULLY COMPREHEND IT AND IF HER PRESERVATION COULD HAVE DEPENDED ON A MOTION OF MY HAND I OUGHT TO HAVE HELD IT UP TO SAVE HER THERE HAS BEEN A TIME SINCEI DO NOT SAY IT LASTED LONG BUT IT HAS BEENWHEN I HAVE ASKED MYSELF THE QUESTION WOULD IT HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR LITTLE EMLY TO HAVE HAD THE WATERS CLOSE ABOVE HER HEAD THAT MORNING IN MY SIGHT AND WHEN I HAVE ANSWERED YES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THIS MAY BE PREMATURE I HAVE SET IT DOWN TOO SOON PERHAPS BUT LET IT STAND WE STROLLED A LONG WAY AND LOADED OURSELVES WITH THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT CURIOUS AND PUT SOME STRANDED STARFISH CAREFULLY BACK INTO THE WATERI HARDLY KNOW ENOUGH OF THE RACE AT THIS MOMENT TO BE QUITE CERTAIN WHETHER THEY HAD REASON TO FEEL OBLIGED TO US FOR DOING SO OR THE REVERSEAND THEN MADE OUR WAY HOME TO MR PEGGOTTYS DWELLING WE STOPPED UNDER THE LEE OF THE LOBSTEROUTHOUSE TO EXCHANGE AN INNOCENT KISS AND WENT IN TO BREAKFAST GLOWING WITH HEALTH AND PLEASURE LIKE TWO YOUNG MAVISHES MR PEGGOTTY SAID I KNEW THIS MEANT IN OUR LOCAL DIALECT LIKE TWO YOUNG THRUSHES AND RECEIVED IT AS A COMPLIMENT OF COURSE I WAS IN LOVE WITH LITTLE EMLY I AM SURE I LOVED THAT BABY QUITE AS TRULY QUITE AS TENDERLY WITH GREATER PURITY AND MORE DISINTERESTEDNESS THAN CAN ENTER INTO THE BEST LOVE OF A LATER TIME OF LIFE HIGH AND ENNOBLING AS IT IS I AM SURE MY FANCY RAISED UP SOMETHING ROUND THAT BLUEEYED MITE OF A CHILD WHICH ETHEREALIZED AND MADE A VERY ANGEL OF HER IF ANY SUNNY FORENOON SHE HAD SPREAD A LITTLE PAIR OF WINGS AND FLOWN AWAY BEFORE MY EYES I DONT THINK I SHOULD HAVE REGARDED IT AS MUCH MORE THAN I HAD HAD REASON TO EXPECT WE USED TO WALK ABOUT THAT DIM OLD FLAT AT YARMOUTH IN A LOVING MANNER HOURS AND HOURS THE DAYS SPORTED BY US AS IF TIME HAD NOT GROWN UP HIMSELF YET BUT WERE A CHILD TOO AND ALWAYS AT PLAY I TOLD EMLY I ADORED HER AND THAT UNLESS SHE CONFESSED SHE ADORED ME I SHOULD BE REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY OF KILLING MYSELF WITH A SWORD SHE SAID SHE DID AND I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE DID AS TO ANY SENSE OF INEQUALITY OR YOUTHFULNESS OR OTHER DIFFICULTY IN OUR WAY LITTLE EMLY AND I HAD NO SUCH TROUBLE BECAUSE WE HAD NO FUTURE WE MADE NO MORE PROVISION FOR GROWING OLDER THAN WE DID FOR GROWING YOUNGER WE WERE THE ADMIRATION OF MRS GUMMIDGE AND PEGGOTTY WHO USED TO WHISPER OF AN EVENING WHEN WE SAT LOVINGLY ON OUR LITTLE LOCKER SIDE BY SIDE LOR WASNT IT BEAUTIFUL MR PEGGOTTY SMILED AT US FROM BEHIND HIS PIPE AND HAM GRINNED ALL THE EVENING AND DID NOTHING ELSE THEY HAD SOMETHING OF THE SORT OF PLEASURE IN US I SUPPOSE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE HAD IN A PRETTY TOY OR A POCKET MODEL OF THE COLOSSEUM I SOON FOUND OUT THAT MRS GUMMIDGE DID NOT ALWAYS MAKE HERSELF SO AGREEABLE AS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER RESIDENCE WITH MR PEGGOTTY MRS GUMMIDGES WAS RATHER A FRETFUL DISPOSITION AND SHE WHIMPERED MORE SOMETIMES THAN WAS COMFORTABLE FOR OTHER PARTIES IN SO SMALL AN ESTABLISHMENT I WAS VERY SORRY FOR HER BUT THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE AGREEABLE I THOUGHT IF MRS GUMMIDGE HAD HAD A CONVENIENT APARTMENT OF HER OWN TO RETIRE TO AND HAD STOPPED THERE UNTIL HER SPIRITS REVIVED MR PEGGOTTY WENT OCCASIONALLY TO A PUBLICHOUSE CALLED THE WILLING MIND I DISCOVERED THIS BY HIS BEING OUT ON THE SECOND OR THIRD EVENING OF OUR VISIT AND BY MRS GUMMIDGES LOOKING UP AT THE DUTCH CLOCK BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE AND SAYING HE WAS THERE AND THAT WHAT WAS MORE SHE HAD KNOWN IN THE MORNING HE WOULD GO THERE MRS GUMMIDGE HAD BEEN IN A LOW STATE ALL DAY AND HAD BURST INTO TEARS IN THE FORENOON WHEN THE FIRE SMOKED I AM A LONE LORN CREETUR WERE MRS GUMMIDGES WORDS WHEN THAT UNPLEASANT OCCURRENCE TOOK PLACE AND EVERYTHINK GOES CONTRARY WITH ME OH ITLL SOON LEAVE OFF SAID PEGGOTTYI AGAIN MEAN OUR PEGGOTTYAND BESIDES YOU KNOW ITS NOT MORE DISAGREEABLE TO YOU THAN TO US I FEEL IT MORE SAID MRS GUMMIDGE IT WAS A VERY COLD DAY WITH CUTTING BLASTS OF WIND MRS GUMMIDGES PECULIAR CORNER OF THE FIRESIDE SEEMED TO ME TO BE THE WARMEST AND SNUGGEST IN THE PLACE AS HER CHAIR WAS CERTAINLY THE EASIEST BUT IT DIDNT SUIT HER THAT DAY AT ALL SHE WAS CONSTANTLY COMPLAINING OF THE COLD AND OF ITS OCCASIONING A VISITATION IN HER BACK WHICH SHE CALLED THE CREEPS AT LAST SHE SHED TEARS ON THAT SUBJECT AND SAID AGAIN THAT SHE WAS A LONE LORN CREETUR AND EVERYTHINK WENT CONTRARY WITH HER IT IS CERTAINLY VERY COLD SAID PEGGOTTY EVERYBODY MUST FEEL IT SO I FEEL IT MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE SAID MRS GUMMIDGE SO AT DINNER WHEN MRS GUMMIDGE WAS ALWAYS HELPED IMMEDIATELY AFTER ME TO WHOM THE PREFERENCE WAS GIVEN AS A VISITOR OF DISTINCTION THE FISH WERE SMALL AND BONY AND THE POTATOES WERE A LITTLE BURNT WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE FELT THIS SOMETHING OF A DISAPPOINTMENT BUT MRS GUMMIDGE SAID SHE FELT IT MORE THAN WE DID AND SHED TEARS AGAIN AND MADE THAT FORMER DECLARATION WITH GREAT BITTERNESS ACCORDINGLY WHEN MR PEGGOTTY CAME HOME ABOUT NINE OCLOCK THIS UNFORTUNATE MRS GUMMIDGE WAS KNITTING IN HER CORNER IN A VERY WRETCHED AND MISERABLE CONDITION PEGGOTTY HAD BEEN WORKING CHEERFULLY HAM HAD BEEN PATCHING UP A GREAT PAIR OF WATERBOOTS AND I WITH LITTLE EMLY BY MY SIDE HAD BEEN READING TO THEM MRS GUMMIDGE HAD NEVER MADE ANY OTHER REMARK THAN A FORLORN SIGH AND HAD NEVER RAISED HER EYES SINCE TEA WELL MATES SAID MR PEGGOTTY TAKING HIS SEAT AND HOW ARE YOU WE ALL SAID SOMETHING OR LOOKED SOMETHING TO WELCOME HIM EXCEPT MRS GUMMIDGE WHO ONLY SHOOK HER HEAD OVER HER KNITTING WHATS AMISS SAID MR PEGGOTTY WITH A CLAP OF HIS HANDS CHEER UP OLD MAWTHER MR PEGGOTTY MEANT OLD GIRL MRS GUMMIDGE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ABLE TO CHEER UP SHE TOOK OUT AN OLD BLACK SILK HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HER EYES BUT INSTEAD OF PUTTING IT IN HER POCKET KEPT IT OUT AND WIPED THEM AGAIN AND STILL KEPT IT OUT READY FOR USE WHATS AMISS DAME SAID MR PEGGOTTY NOTHING RETURNED MRS GUMMIDGE YOUVE COME FROM THE WILLING MIND DANL WHY YES IVE TOOK A SHORT SPELL AT THE WILLING MIND TONIGHT SAID MR PEGGOTTY IM SORRY I SHOULD DRIVE YOU THERE SAID MRS GUMMIDGE DRIVE I DONT WANT NO DRIVING RETURNED MR PEGGOTTY WITH AN HONEST LAUGH I ONLY GO TOO READY VERY READY SAID MRS GUMMIDGE SHAKING HER HEAD AND WIPING HER EYES YES YES VERY READY I AM SORRY IT SHOULD BE ALONG OF ME THAT YOURE SO READY ALONG O YOU IT ANT ALONG O YOU SAID MR PEGGOTTY DONT YE BELIEVE A BIT ON IT YES YES IT IS CRIED MRS GUMMIDGE I KNOW WHAT I AM I KNOW THAT I AM A LONE LORN CREETUR AND NOT ONLY THAT EVERYTHINK GOES CONTRARY WITH ME BUT THAT I GO CONTRARY WITH EVERYBODY YES YES I FEEL MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE DO AND I SHOW IT MORE ITS MY MISFORTUN I REALLY COULDNT HELP THINKING AS I SAT TAKING IN ALL THIS THAT THE MISFORTUNE EXTENDED TO SOME OTHER MEMBERS OF THAT FAMILY BESIDES MRS GUMMIDGE BUT MR PEGGOTTY MADE NO SUCH RETORT ONLY ANSWERING WITH ANOTHER ENTREATY TO MRS GUMMIDGE TO CHEER UP I ANT WHAT I COULD WISH MYSELF TO BE SAID MRS GUMMIDGE I AM FAR FROM IT I KNOW WHAT I AM MY TROUBLES HAS MADE ME CONTRARY I FEEL MY TROUBLES AND THEY MAKE ME CONTRARY I WISH I DIDNT FEEL EM BUT I DO I WISH I COULD BE HARDENED TO EM BUT I ANT I MAKE THE HOUSE UNCOMFORTABLE I DONT WONDER AT IT IVE MADE YOUR SISTER SO ALL DAY AND MASTER DAVY HERE I WAS SUDDENLY MELTED AND ROARED OUT NO YOU HAVENT MRS GUMMIDGE IN GREAT MENTAL DISTRESS ITS FAR FROM RIGHT THAT I SHOULD DO IT SAID MRS GUMMIDGE IT ANT A FIT RETURN I HAD BETTER GO INTO THE HOUSE AND DIE I AM A LONE LORN CREETUR AND HAD MUCH BETTER NOT MAKE MYSELF CONTRARY HERE IF THINKS MUST GO CONTRARY WITH ME AND I MUST GO CONTRARY MYSELF LET ME GO CONTRARY IN MY PARISH DANL ID BETTER GO INTO THE HOUSE AND DIE AND BE A RIDDANCE MRS GUMMIDGE RETIRED WITH THESE WORDS AND BETOOK HERSELF TO BED WHEN SHE WAS GONE MR PEGGOTTY WHO HAD NOT EXHIBITED A TRACE OF ANY FEELING BUT THE PROFOUNDEST SYMPATHY LOOKED ROUND UPON US AND NODDING HIS HEAD WITH A LIVELY EXPRESSION OF THAT SENTIMENT STILL ANIMATING HIS FACE SAID IN A WHISPER SHES BEEN THINKING OF THE OLD UN I DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT OLD ONE MRS GUMMIDGE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE FIXED HER MIND UPON UNTIL PEGGOTTY ON SEEING ME TO BED EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS THE LATE MR GUMMIDGE AND THAT HER BROTHER ALWAYS TOOK THAT FOR A RECEIVED TRUTH ON SUCH OCCASIONS AND THAT IT ALWAYS HAD A MOVING EFFECT UPON HIM SOME TIME AFTER HE WAS IN HIS HAMMOCK THAT NIGHT I HEARD HIM MYSELF REPEAT TO HAM POOR THING SHES BEEN THINKING OF THE OLD UN AND WHENEVER MRS GUMMIDGE WAS OVERCOME IN A SIMILAR MANNER DURING THE REMAINDER OF OUR STAY WHICH HAPPENED SOME FEW TIMES HE ALWAYS SAID THE SAME THING IN EXTENUATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE AND ALWAYS WITH THE TENDEREST COMMISERATION SO THE FORTNIGHT SLIPPED AWAY VARIED BY NOTHING BUT THE VARIATION OF THE TIDE WHICH ALTERED MR PEGGOTTYS TIMES OF GOING OUT AND COMING IN AND ALTERED HAMS ENGAGEMENTS ALSO WHEN THE LATTER WAS UNEMPLOYED HE SOMETIMES WALKED WITH US TO SHOW US THE BOATS AND SHIPS AND ONCE OR TWICE HE TOOK US FOR A ROW I DONT KNOW WHY ONE SLIGHT SET OF IMPRESSIONS SHOULD BE MORE PARTICULARLY ASSOCIATED WITH A PLACE THAN ANOTHER THOUGH I BELIEVE THIS OBTAINS WITH MOST PEOPLE IN REFERENCE ESPECIALLY TO THE ASSOCIATIONS OF THEIR CHILDHOOD I NEVER HEAR THE NAME OR READ THE NAME OF YARMOUTH BUT I AM REMINDED OF A CERTAIN SUNDAY MORNING ON THE BEACH THE BELLS RINGING FOR CHURCH LITTLE EMLY LEANING ON MY SHOULDER HAM LAZILY DROPPING STONES INTO THE WATER AND THE SUN AWAY AT SEA JUST BREAKING THROUGH THE HEAVY MIST AND SHOWING US THE SHIPS LIKE THEIR OWN SHADOWS AT LAST THE DAY CAME FOR GOING HOME I BORE UP AGAINST THE SEPARATION FROM MR PEGGOTTY AND MRS GUMMIDGE BUT MY AGONY OF MIND AT LEAVING LITTLE EMLY WAS PIERCING WE WENT ARMINARM TO THE PUBLICHOUSE WHERE THE CARRIER PUT UP AND I PROMISED ON THE ROAD TO WRITE TO HER I REDEEMED THAT PROMISE AFTERWARDS IN CHARACTERS LARGER THAN THOSE IN WHICH APARTMENTS ARE USUALLY ANNOUNCED IN MANUSCRIPT AS BEING TO LET WE WERE GREATLY OVERCOME AT PARTING AND IF EVER IN MY LIFE I HAVE HAD A VOID MADE IN MY HEART I HAD ONE MADE THAT DAY NOW ALL THE TIME I HAD BEEN ON MY VISIT I HAD BEEN UNGRATEFUL TO MY HOME AGAIN AND HAD THOUGHT LITTLE OR NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT I WAS NO SOONER TURNED TOWARDS IT THAN MY REPROACHFUL YOUNG CONSCIENCE SEEMED TO POINT THAT WAY WITH A READY FINGER AND I FELT ALL THE MORE FOR THE SINKING OF MY SPIRITS THAT IT WAS MY NEST AND THAT MY MOTHER WAS MY COMFORTER AND FRIEND THIS GAINED UPON ME AS WE WENT ALONG SO THAT THE NEARER WE DREW THE MORE FAMILIAR THE OBJECTS BECAME THAT WE PASSED THE MORE EXCITED I WAS TO GET THERE AND TO RUN INTO HER ARMS BUT PEGGOTTY INSTEAD OF SHARING IN THOSE TRANSPORTS TRIED TO CHECK THEM THOUGH VERY KINDLY AND LOOKED CONFUSED AND OUT OF SORTS BLUNDERSTONE ROOKERY WOULD COME HOWEVER IN SPITE OF HER WHEN THE CARRIERS HORSE PLEASEDAND DID HOW WELL I RECOLLECT IT ON A COLD GREY AFTERNOON WITH A DULL SKY THREATENING RAIN THE DOOR OPENED AND I LOOKED HALF LAUGHING AND HALF CRYING IN MY PLEASANT AGITATION FOR MY MOTHER IT WAS NOT SHE BUT A STRANGE SERVANT WHY PEGGOTTY I SAID RUEFULLY ISNT SHE COME HOME YES YES MASTER DAVY SAID PEGGOTTY SHES COME HOME WAIT A BIT MASTER DAVY AND ILLILL TELL YOU SOMETHING BETWEEN HER AGITATION AND HER NATURAL AWKWARDNESS IN GETTING OUT OF THE CART PEGGOTTY WAS MAKING A MOST EXTRAORDINARY FESTOON OF HERSELF BUT I FELT TOO BLANK AND STRANGE TO TELL HER SO WHEN SHE HAD GOT DOWN SHE TOOK ME BY THE HAND LED ME WONDERING INTO THE KITCHEN AND SHUT THE DOOR PEGGOTTY SAID I

THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT THERE AT SOME SHRUBS THAT WERE DROOPING THEIR HEADS IN THE COLD AS SOON AS I COULD CREEP AWAY I CREPT UPSTAIRS MY OLD DEAR BEDROOM WAS CHANGED AND I WAS TO LIE A LONG WAY OFF I RAMBLED DOWNSTAIRS TO FIND ANYTHING THAT WAS LIKE ITSELF SO ALTERED IT ALL SEEMED AND ROAMED INTO THE YARD I VERY SOON STARTED BACK FROM THERE FOR THE EMPTY DOGKENNEL WAS FILLED UP WITH A GREAT DOGDEEP MOUTHED AND BLACKHAIRED LIKE HIMAND HE WAS VERY ANGRY AT THE SIGHT OF ME AND SPRANG OUT TO GET AT ME CHAPTER I FALL INTO DISGRACE IF THE ROOM TO WHICH MY BED WAS REMOVED WERE A SENTIENT THING THAT COULD GIVE EVIDENCE I MIGHT APPEAL TO IT AT THIS DAYWHO SLEEPS THERE NOW I WONDERTO BEAR WITNESS FOR ME WHAT A HEAVY HEART I CARRIED TO IT I WENT UP THERE HEARING THE DOG IN THE YARD BARK AFTER ME ALL THE WAY WHILE I CLIMBED THE STAIRS AND LOOKING AS BLANK AND STRANGE UPON THE ROOM AS THE ROOM LOOKED UPON ME SAT DOWN WITH MY SMALL HANDS CROSSED AND THOUGHT I THOUGHT OF THE ODDEST THINGS OF THE SHAPE OF THE ROOM OF THE CRACKS IN THE CEILING OF THE PAPER ON THE WALLS OF THE FLAWS IN THE WINDOWGLASS MAKING RIPPLES AND DIMPLES ON THE PROSPECT OF THE WASHINGSTAND BEING RICKETY ON ITS THREE LEGS AND HAVING A DISCONTENTED SOMETHING ABOUT IT WHICH REMINDED ME OF MRS GUMMIDGE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE OLD ONE I WAS CRYING ALL THE TIME BUT EXCEPT THAT I WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING COLD AND DEJECTED I AM SURE I NEVER THOUGHT WHY I CRIED AT LAST IN MY DESOLATION I BEGAN TO CONSIDER THAT I WAS DREADFULLY IN LOVE WITH LITTLE EMLY AND HAD BEEN TORN AWAY FROM HER TO COME HERE WHERE NO ONE SEEMED TO WANT ME OR TO CARE ABOUT ME HALF AS MUCH AS SHE DID THIS MADE SUCH A VERY MISERABLE PIECE OF BUSINESS OF IT THAT I ROLLED MYSELF UP IN A CORNER OF THE COUNTERPANE AND CRIED MYSELF TO SLEEP I WAS AWOKE BY SOMEBODY SAYING HERE HE IS AND UNCOVERING MY HOT HEAD MY MOTHER AND PEGGOTTY HAD COME TO LOOK FOR ME AND IT WAS ONE OF THEM WHO HAD DONE IT DAVY SAID MY MOTHER WHATS THE MATTER I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD ASK ME AND ANSWERED NOTHING I TURNED OVER ON MY FACE I RECOLLECT TO HIDE MY TREMBLING LIP WHICH ANSWERED HER WITH GREATER TRUTH DAVY SAID MY MOTHER DAVY MY CHILD I DARE SAY NO WORDS SHE COULD HAVE UTTERED WOULD HAVE AFFECTED ME SO MUCH THEN AS HER CALLING ME HER CHILD I HID MY TEARS IN THE BEDCLOTHES AND PRESSED HER FROM ME WITH MY HAND WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE RAISED ME UP THIS IS YOUR DOING PEGGOTTY YOU CRUEL THING SAID MY MOTHER I HAVE NO DOUBT AT ALL ABOUT IT HOW CAN YOU RECONCILE IT TO YOUR CONSCIENCE I WONDER TO PREJUDICE MY OWN BOY AGAINST ME OR AGAINST ANYBODY WHO IS DEAR TO ME WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY IT PEGGOTTY POOR PEGGOTTY LIFTED UP HER HANDS AND EYES AND ONLY ANSWERED IN A SORT OF PARAPHRASE OF THE GRACE I USUALLY REPEATED AFTER DINNER LORD FORGIVE YOU MRS COPPERFIELD AND FOR WHAT YOU HAVE SAID THIS MINUTE MAY YOU NEVER BE TRULY SORRY ITS ENOUGH TO DISTRACT ME CRIED MY MOTHER IN MY HONEYMOON TOO WHEN MY MOST INVETERATE ENEMY MIGHT RELENT ONE WOULD THINK AND NOT ENVY ME A LITTLE PEACE OF MIND AND HAPPINESS DAVY YOU NAUGHTY BOY PEGGOTTY YOU SAVAGE CREATURE OH DEAR ME CRIED MY MOTHER TURNING FROM ONE OF US TO THE OTHER IN HER PETTISH WILFUL MANNER WHAT A TROUBLESOME WORLD THIS IS WHEN ONE HAS THE MOST RIGHT TO EXPECT IT TO BE AS AGREEABLE AS POSSIBLE I FELT THE TOUCH OF A HAND THAT I KNEW WAS NEITHER HERS NOR PEGGOTTYS AND SLIPPED TO MY FEET AT THE BEDSIDE IT WAS MR MURDSTONES HAND AND HE KEPT IT ON MY ARM AS HE SAID WHATS THIS CLARA MY LOVE HAVE YOU FORGOTTENFIRMNESS MY DEAR I AM VERY SORRY EDWARD SAID MY MOTHER I MEANT TO BE

HIM WHISPERED IN HER EAR AND KISSED HER I KNEW AS WELL WHEN I SAW MY MOTHERS HEAD LEAN DOWN UPON HIS SHOULDER AND HER ARM TOUCH HIS NECKI KNEW AS WELL THAT HE COULD MOULD HER PLIANT NATURE INTO ANY FORM HE CHOSE AS I KNOW NOW THAT HE DID IT GO YOU BELOW MY LOVE SAID MR MURDSTONE DAVID AND I WILL COME DOWN TOGETHER MY FRIEND TURNING A DARKENING FACE ON PEGGOTTY WHEN HE HAD WATCHED MY MOTHER OUT AND DISMISSED HER WITH A NOD AND A SMILE DO YOU KNOW YOUR MISTRESSS NAME SHE HAS BEEN MY MISTRESS A LONG TIME SIR ANSWERED PEGGOTTY I OUGHT TO KNOW IT THATS TRUE HE ANSWERED BUT I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU AS I CAME UPSTAIRS ADDRESS HER BY A NAME THAT IS NOT HERS SHE HAS TAKEN MINE YOU KNOW WILL YOU REMEMBER THAT PEGGOTTY WITH SOME UNEASY GLANCES AT ME CURTSEYED HERSELF OUT OF THE ROOM WITHOUT REPLYING SEEING I SUPPOSE THAT SHE WAS EXPECTED TO GO AND HAD NO EXCUSE FOR REMAINING WHEN WE TWO WERE LEFT ALONE HE SHUT THE DOOR AND SITTING ON A CHAIR AND HOLDING ME STANDING BEFORE HIM LOOKED STEADILY INTO MY EYES I FELT MY OWN ATTRACTED NO LESS STEADILY TO HIS AS I RECALL OUR BEING OPPOSED THUS FACE TO FACE I SEEM AGAIN TO HEAR MY HEART BEAT FAST AND HIGH DAVID HE SAID MAKING HIS LIPS THIN BY PRESSING THEM TOGETHER IF I HAVE AN OBSTINATE HORSE OR DOG TO DEAL WITH WHAT DO YOU THINK I DO I DONT KNOW I BEAT HIM I HAD ANSWERED IN A KIND OF BREATHLESS WHISPER BUT I FELT IN MY SILENCE THAT MY BREATH WAS SHORTER NOW I MAKE HIM WINCE AND SMART I SAY TO MYSELF ILL CONQUER THAT FELLOW AND IF IT WERE TO COST HIM ALL THE BLOOD HE HAD I SHOULD DO IT WHAT IS THAT UPON YOUR FACE DIRT I SAID HE KNEW IT WAS THE MARK OF TEARS AS WELL AS I BUT IF HE HAD ASKED THE QUESTION TWENTY TIMES EACH TIME WITH TWENTY BLOWS I BELIEVE MY BABY HEART WOULD HAVE BURST BEFORE I WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM SO YOU HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF INTELLIGENCE FOR A LITTLE FELLOW HE SAID WITH A GRAVE SMILE THAT BELONGED TO HIM AND YOU UNDERSTOOD ME VERY WELL I SEE WASH THAT FACE SIR AND COME DOWN WITH ME HE POINTED TO THE WASHINGSTAND WHICH I HAD MADE OUT TO BE LIKE MRS GUMMIDGE AND MOTIONED ME WITH HIS HEAD TO OBEY HIM DIRECTLY I HAD LITTLE DOUBT THEN AND I HAVE LESS DOUBT NOW THAT HE WOULD HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITHOUT THE LEAST COMPUNCTION IF I HAD HESITATED CLARA MY DEAR HE SAID WHEN I HAD DONE HIS BIDDING AND HE WALKED ME INTO THE PARLOUR WITH HIS HAND STILL ON MY ARM YOU WILL NOT BE MADE UNCOMFORTABLE ANY MORE I HOPE WE SHALL SOON IMPROVE OUR YOUTHFUL HUMOURS GOD HELP ME I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPROVED FOR MY WHOLE LIFE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE ANOTHER CREATURE PERHAPS FOR LIFE BY A KIND WORD AT THAT SEASON A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND EXPLANATION OF PITY FOR MY CHILDISH IGNORANCE OF WELCOME HOME OF REASSURANCE TO ME THAT IT WAS HOME MIGHT HAVE MADE ME DUTIFUL TO HIM IN MY HEART HENCEFORTH INSTEAD OF IN MY HYPOCRITICAL OUTSIDE AND MIGHT HAVE MADE ME RESPECT INSTEAD OF HATE HIM I THOUGHT MY MOTHER WAS SORRY TO SEE ME STANDING IN THE ROOM SO SCARED AND STRANGE AND THAT PRESENTLY WHEN I STOLE TO A CHAIR SHE FOLLOWED ME WITH HER EYES MORE SORROWFULLY STILLMISSING PERHAPS SOME FREEDOM IN MY CHILDISH TREADBUT THE WORD WAS NOT SPOKEN AND THE TIME FOR IT WAS GONE WE DINED ALONE WE THREE TOGETHER HE SEEMED TO BE VERY FOND OF MY MOTHERI AM AFRAID I LIKED HIM NONE THE BETTER FOR THATAND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF HIM I GATHERED FROM WHAT THEY SAID THAT AN ELDER SISTER OF HIS WAS COMING TO STAY WITH THEM AND THAT SHE WAS EXPECTED THAT EVENING I AM NOT CERTAIN WHETHER I FOUND OUT THEN OR AFTERWARDS THAT WITHOUT BEING ACTIVELY CONCERNED IN ANY BUSINESS HE HAD SOME SHARE IN OR SOME ANNUAL CHARGE UPON THE PROFITS OF A WINEMERCHANTS HOUSE IN LONDON WITH WHICH HIS FAMILY HAD BEEN CONNECTED FROM HIS GREATGRANDFATHERS TIME AND IN WHICH HIS SISTER HAD A SIMILAR INTEREST BUT I MAY MENTION IT IN THIS PLACE WHETHER OR NO AFTER DINNER WHEN WE WERE SITTING BY THE FIRE AND I WAS MEDITATING AN ESCAPE TO PEGGOTTY WITHOUT HAVING THE HARDIHOOD TO SLIP AWAY LEST IT SHOULD OFFEND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE A COACH DROVE UP TO THE GARDENGATE AND HE WENT OUT TO RECEIVE THE VISITOR MY MOTHER FOLLOWED HIM I WAS TIMIDLY FOLLOWING HER WHEN SHE TURNED ROUND AT THE PARLOUR DOOR IN THE DUSK AND TAKING ME IN HER EMBRACE AS SHE HAD BEEN USED TO DO WHISPERED ME TO LOVE MY NEW FATHER AND BE OBEDIENT TO HIM SHE DID THIS HURRIEDLY AND SECRETLY AS IF IT WERE WRONG BUT TENDERLY AND PUTTING OUT HER HAND BEHIND HER HELD MINE IN IT UNTIL WE CAME NEAR TO WHERE HE WAS STANDING IN THE GARDEN WHERE SHE LET MINE GO AND DREW HERS THROUGH HIS ARM IT WAS MISS MURDSTONE WHO WAS ARRIVED AND A GLOOMYLOOKING LADY SHE WAS DARK LIKE HER BROTHER WHOM SHE GREATLY RESEMBLED IN FACE AND VOICE AND WITH VERY HEAVY EYEBROWS NEARLY MEETING OVER HER LARGE NOSE AS IF BEING DISABLED BY THE WRONGS OF HER SEX FROM WEARING WHISKERS SHE HAD CARRIED THEM TO THAT ACCOUNT SHE BROUGHT WITH HER TWO UNCOMPROMISING HARD BLACK BOXES WITH HER INITIALS ON THE LIDS IN HARD BRASS NAILS WHEN SHE PAID THE COACHMAN SHE TOOK HER MONEY OUT OF A HARD STEEL PURSE AND SHE KEPT THE PURSE IN A VERY JAIL OF A BAG WHICH HUNG UPON HER ARM BY A HEAVY CHAIN AND SHUT UP LIKE A BITE I HAD NEVER AT THAT TIME SEEN SUCH A METALLIC LADY ALTOGETHER AS MISS MURDSTONE WAS SHE WAS BROUGHT INTO THE PARLOUR WITH MANY TOKENS OF WELCOME AND THERE FORMALLY RECOGNIZED MY MOTHER AS A NEW AND NEAR RELATION THEN SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID IS THAT YOUR BOY SISTERINLAW MY MOTHER ACKNOWLEDGED ME GENERALLY SPEAKING SAID MISS MURDSTONE I DONT LIKE BOYS HOW DYE DO BOY UNDER THESE ENCOURAGING CIRCUMSTANCES I REPLIED THAT I WAS VERY WELL AND THAT I HOPED SHE WAS THE SAME WITH SUCH AN INDIFFERENT GRACE THAT MISS MURDSTONE DISPOSED OF ME IN TWO WORDS WANTS MANNER HAVING UTTERED WHICH WITH GREAT DISTINCTNESS SHE BEGGED THE FAVOUR OF BEING SHOWN TO HER ROOM WHICH BECAME TO ME FROM THAT TIME FORTH A PLACE OF AWE AND DREAD WHEREIN THE TWO BLACK BOXES WERE NEVER SEEN OPEN OR KNOWN TO BE LEFT UNLOCKED AND WHERE FOR I PEEPED IN ONCE OR TWICE WHEN SHE WAS OUT NUMEROUS LITTLE STEEL FETTERS AND RIVETS WITH WHICH MISS MURDSTONE EMBELLISHED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS DRESSED GENERALLY HUNG UPON THE LOOKINGGLASS IN FORMIDABLE ARRAY AS WELL AS I COULD MAKE OUT SHE HAD COME FOR GOOD AND HAD NO INTENTION OF EVER GOING AGAIN SHE BEGAN TO HELP MY MOTHER NEXT MORNING AND WAS IN AND OUT OF THE STORECLOSET ALL DAY PUTTING THINGS TO RIGHTS AND MAKING HAVOC IN THE OLD ARRANGEMENTS ALMOST THE FIRST REMARKABLE THING I OBSERVED IN MISS MURDSTONE WAS HER BEING CONSTANTLY HAUNTED BY A SUSPICION THAT THE SERVANTS HAD A MAN SECRETED SOMEWHERE ON THE PREMISES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS DELUSION SHE DIVED INTO THE COALCELLAR AT THE MOST UNTIMELY HOURS AND SCARCELY EVER OPENED THE DOOR OF A DARK CUPBOARD WITHOUT CLAPPING IT TO AGAIN IN THE BELIEF THAT SHE HAD GOT HIM THOUGH THERE WAS NOTHING VERY AIRY ABOUT MISS MURDSTONE SHE WAS A PERFECT LARK IN POINT OF GETTING UP SHE WAS UP AND AS I BELIEVE TO THIS HOUR LOOKING FOR THAT MAN BEFORE ANYBODY IN THE HOUSE WAS STIRRING PEGGOTTY GAVE IT AS HER OPINION THAT SHE EVEN SLEPT WITH ONE EYE OPEN BUT I COULD NOT CONCUR IN THIS IDEA FOR I TRIED IT MYSELF AFTER HEARING THE SUGGESTION THROWN OUT AND FOUND IT COULDNT BE DONE ON THE VERY FIRST MORNING AFTER HER ARRIVAL SHE WAS UP AND RINGING HER BELL AT COCKCROW WHEN MY MOTHER CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND WAS GOING TO MAKE THE TEA MISS MURDSTONE GAVE HER A KIND OF PECK ON THE CHEEK WHICH WAS HER NEAREST APPROACH TO A KISS AND SAID NOW CLARA MY DEAR I AM COME HERE YOU KNOW TO RELIEVE YOU OF ALL THE TROUBLE I CAN YOURE MUCH TOO PRETTY AND THOUGHTLESSMY MOTHER BLUSHED BUT LAUGHED AND SEEMED NOT TO DISLIKE THIS CHARACTERTO HAVE ANY DUTIES IMPOSED UPON YOU THAT CAN BE UNDERTAKEN BY ME IF YOULL BE SO GOOD AS GIVE ME YOUR KEYS MY DEAR ILL ATTEND TO ALL THIS SORT OF THING IN FUTURE FROM THAT TIME MISS MURDSTONE KEPT THE KEYS IN HER OWN LITTLE JAIL ALL DAY AND UNDER HER PILLOW ALL NIGHT AND MY MOTHER HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH THEM THAN I HAD MY MOTHER DID NOT SUFFER HER AUTHORITY TO PASS FROM HER WITHOUT A SHADOW OF PROTEST ONE NIGHT WHEN MISS MURDSTONE HAD BEEN DEVELOPING CERTAIN HOUSEHOLD PLANS TO HER BROTHER OF WHICH HE SIGNIFIED HIS APPROBATION MY MOTHER SUDDENLY BEGAN TO CRY AND SAID SHE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSULTED CLARA SAID MR MURDSTONE STERNLY CLARA I WONDER AT YOU OH ITS VERY WELL TO SAY YOU WONDER EDWARD CRIED MY MOTHER AND ITS VERY WELL FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT FIRMNESS BUT YOU WOULDNT LIKE IT YOURSELF FIRMNESS I MAY OBSERVE WAS THE GRAND QUALITY ON WHICH BOTH MR AND MISS MURDSTONE TOOK THEIR STAND HOWEVER I MIGHT HAVE EXPRESSED MY COMPREHENSION OF IT AT THAT TIME IF I HAD BEEN CALLED UPON I NEVERTHELESS DID CLEARLY COMPREHEND IN MY OWN WAY THAT IT WAS ANOTHER NAME FOR TYRANNY AND FOR A CERTAIN GLOOMY ARROGANT DEVILS HUMOUR THAT WAS IN THEM BOTH THE CREED AS I SHOULD STATE IT NOW WAS THIS MR MURDSTONE WAS FIRM NOBODY IN HIS WORLD WAS TO BE SO FIRM AS MR MURDSTONE NOBODY ELSE IN HIS WORLD WAS TO BE FIRM AT ALL FOR EVERYBODY WAS TO BE BENT TO HIS FIRMNESS MISS MURDSTONE WAS AN EXCEPTION SHE MIGHT BE FIRM BUT ONLY BY RELATIONSHIP AND IN AN INFERIOR AND TRIBUTARY DEGREE MY MOTHER WAS ANOTHER EXCEPTION SHE MIGHT BE FIRM AND MUST BE BUT ONLY IN BEARING THEIR FIRMNESS AND FIRMLY BELIEVING THERE WAS NO OTHER FIRMNESS UPON EARTH ITS VERY HARD SAID MY MOTHER THAT IN MY OWN HOUSE MY OWN HOUSE REPEATED MR MURDSTONE CLARA OUR OWN HOUSE I MEAN

MADE A JAILDELIVERY OF HER POCKETHANDKERCHIEF AND HELD IT BEFORE HER EYES CLARA HE CONTINUED LOOKING AT MY MOTHER YOU SURPRISE ME YOU ASTOUND ME YES I HAD A SATISFACTION IN THE THOUGHT OF MARRYING AN INEXPERIENCED AND ARTLESS PERSON AND FORMING HER CHARACTER AND INFUSING INTO IT SOME AMOUNT OF THAT FIRMNESS AND DECISION OF WHICH IT STOOD IN NEED BUT WHEN JANE MURDSTONE IS KIND ENOUGH TO COME TO MY ASSISTANCE IN THIS ENDEAVOUR AND TO ASSUME FOR MY SAKE A CONDITION SOMETHING LIKE A HOUSEKEEPERS AND WHEN SHE MEETS WITH A BASE RETURN OH PRAY PRAY EDWARD CRIED MY MOTHER DONT ACCUSE ME OF BEING UNGRATEFUL I AM SURE I AM NOT UNGRATEFUL NO ONE EVER SAID I WAS BEFORE I HAVE MANY FAULTS BUT NOT THAT OH DONT MY DEAR WHEN JANE MURDSTONE MEETS I SAY HE WENT ON AFTER WAITING UNTIL MY MOTHER WAS

YOU EDWARD WITH YOUR STRENGTH OF MIND TO ENDEAVOUR TO CORRECT THEM FOR ME JANE I DONT OBJECT TO ANYTHING I SHOULD BE QUITE BROKENHEARTED IF YOU THOUGHT OF LEAVING MY MOTHER WAS TOO MUCH OVERCOME TO GO ON JANE MURDSTONE SAID MR MURDSTONE TO HIS SISTER ANY HARSH WORDS BETWEEN US ARE I HOPE UNCOMMON IT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT SO UNUSUAL AN OCCURRENCE HAS TAKEN PLACE TONIGHT I WAS BETRAYED INTO IT BY ANOTHER NOR IS IT YOUR FAULT YOU WERE BETRAYED INTO IT BY ANOTHER LET US BOTH TRY TO FORGET IT AND AS THIS HE ADDED AFTER THESE MAGNANIMOUS WORDS IS NOT A FIT SCENE FOR THE BOYDAVID GO TO BED I COULD HARDLY FIND THE DOOR THROUGH THE TEARS THAT STOOD IN MY EYES I WAS SO SORRY FOR MY MOTHERS DISTRESS BUT I GROPED MY WAY OUT AND GROPED MY WAY UP TO MY ROOM IN THE DARK WITHOUT EVEN HAVING THE HEART TO SAY GOOD NIGHT TO PEGGOTTY OR TO GET A CANDLE FROM HER WHEN HER COMING UP TO LOOK FOR ME AN HOUR OR SO AFTERWARDS AWOKE ME SHE SAID THAT MY MOTHER HAD GONE TO BED POORLY AND THAT MR AND MISS MURDSTONE WERE SITTING ALONE GOING DOWN NEXT MORNING RATHER EARLIER THAN USUAL I PAUSED OUTSIDE THE PARLOUR DOOR ON HEARING MY MOTHERS VOICE SHE WAS VERY EARNESTLY AND HUMBLY ENTREATING MISS MURDSTONES PARDON WHICH THAT LADY GRANTED AND A PERFECT RECONCILIATION TOOK PLACE I NEVER KNEW MY MOTHER AFTERWARDS TO GIVE AN OPINION ON ANY MATTER WITHOUT FIRST APPEALING TO MISS MURDSTONE OR WITHOUT HAVING FIRST ASCERTAINED BY SOME SURE MEANS WHAT MISS MURDSTONES OPINION WAS AND I NEVER SAW MISS MURDSTONE WHEN OUT OF TEMPER SHE WAS INFIRM THAT WAY MOVE HER HAND TOWARDS HER BAG AS IF SHE WERE GOING TO TAKE OUT THE KEYS AND OFFER TO RESIGN THEM TO MY MOTHER WITHOUT SEEING THAT MY MOTHER WAS IN A TERRIBLE FRIGHT THE GLOOMY TAINT THAT WAS IN THE MURDSTONE BLOOD DARKENED THE MURDSTONE RELIGION WHICH WAS AUSTERE AND WRATHFUL I HAVE THOUGHT SINCE THAT ITS ASSUMING THAT CHARACTER WAS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF MR MURDSTONES FIRMNESS WHICH WOULDNT ALLOW HIM TO LET ANYBODY OFF FROM THE UTMOST WEIGHT OF THE SEVEREST PENALTIES HE COULD FIND ANY EXCUSE FOR BE THIS AS IT MAY I WELL REMEMBER THE TREMENDOUS VISAGES WITH WHICH WE USED TO GO TO CHURCH AND THE CHANGED AIR OF THE PLACE AGAIN THE DREADED SUNDAY COMES ROUND AND I FILE INTO THE OLD PEW FIRST LIKE A GUARDED CAPTIVE BROUGHT TO A CONDEMNED SERVICE AGAIN MISS MURDSTONE IN A BLACK VELVET GOWN THAT LOOKS AS IF IT HAD BEEN MADE OUT OF A PALL FOLLOWS CLOSE UPON ME THEN MY MOTHER THEN HER HUSBAND THERE IS NO PEGGOTTY NOW AS IN THE OLD TIME AGAIN I LISTEN TO MISS MURDSTONE MUMBLING THE RESPONSES AND EMPHASIZING ALL THE DREAD WORDS WITH A CRUEL RELISH AGAIN I SEE HER DARK EYES ROLL ROUND THE CHURCH WHEN SHE SAYS MISERABLE SINNERS AS IF SHE WERE CALLING ALL THE CONGREGATION NAMES AGAIN I CATCH RARE GLIMPSES OF MY MOTHER MOVING HER LIPS TIMIDLY BETWEEN THE TWO WITH ONE OF THEM MUTTERING AT EACH EAR LIKE LOW THUNDER AGAIN I WONDER WITH A SUDDEN FEAR WHETHER IT IS LIKELY THAT OUR GOOD OLD CLERGYMAN CAN BE WRONG AND MR AND MISS MURDSTONE RIGHT AND THAT ALL THE ANGELS IN HEAVEN CAN BE DESTROYING ANGELS AGAIN IF I MOVE A FINGER OR RELAX A MUSCLE OF MY FACE MISS MURDSTONE POKES ME WITH HER PRAYERBOOK AND MAKES MY SIDE ACHE YES AND AGAIN AS WE WALK HOME I NOTE SOME NEIGHBOURS LOOKING AT MY MOTHER AND AT ME AND WHISPERING AGAIN AS THE THREE GO ON ARMINARM AND I LINGER BEHIND ALONE I FOLLOW SOME OF THOSE LOOKS AND WONDER IF MY MOTHERS STEP BE REALLY NOT SO LIGHT AS I HAVE SEEN IT AND IF THE GAIETY OF HER BEAUTY BE REALLY ALMOST WORRIED AWAY AGAIN I WONDER WHETHER ANY OF THE NEIGHBOURS CALL TO MIND AS I DO HOW WE USED TO WALK HOME TOGETHER SHE AND I AND I WONDER STUPIDLY ABOUT THAT ALL THE DREARY DISMAL DAY THERE HAD BEEN SOME TALK ON OCCASIONS OF MY GOING TO BOARDINGSCHOOL MR AND MISS MURDSTONE HAD ORIGINATED IT AND MY MOTHER HAD OF COURSE AGREED WITH THEM NOTHING HOWEVER WAS CONCLUDED ON THE SUBJECT YET IN THE MEANTIME I LEARNT LESSONS AT HOME SHALL I EVER FORGET THOSE LESSONS THEY WERE PRESIDED OVER NOMINALLY BY MY MOTHER BUT REALLY BY MR MURDSTONE AND HIS SISTER WHO WERE ALWAYS PRESENT AND FOUND THEM A FAVOURABLE OCCASION FOR GIVING MY MOTHER LESSONS IN THAT MISCALLED FIRMNESS WHICH WAS THE BANE OF BOTH OUR LIVES I BELIEVE I WAS KEPT AT HOME FOR THAT PURPOSE I HAD BEEN APT ENOUGH TO LEARN AND WILLING ENOUGH WHEN MY MOTHER AND I HAD LIVED ALONE TOGETHER I CAN FAINTLY REMEMBER LEARNING THE ALPHABET AT HER KNEE TO THIS DAY WHEN I LOOK UPON THE FAT BLACK LETTERS IN THE PRIMER THE PUZZLING NOVELTY OF THEIR SHAPES AND THE EASY GOODNATURE OF O AND Q AND S SEEM TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AGAIN BEFORE ME AS THEY USED TO DO BUT THEY RECALL NO FEELING OF DISGUST OR RELUCTANCE ON THE CONTRARY I SEEM TO HAVE WALKED ALONG A PATH OF FLOWERS AS FAR AS THE CROCODILEBOOK AND TO HAVE BEEN CHEERED BY THE GENTLENESS OF MY MOTHERS VOICE AND MANNER ALL THE WAY BUT THESE SOLEMN LESSONS WHICH SUCCEEDED THOSE I REMEMBER AS THE DEATHBLOW OF MY PEACE AND A GRIEVOUS DAILY DRUDGERY AND MISERY THEY WERE VERY LONG VERY NUMEROUS VERY HARDPERFECTLY UNINTELLIGIBLE SOME OF THEM TO MEAND I WAS GENERALLY AS MUCH BEWILDERED BY THEM AS I BELIEVE MY POOR MOTHER WAS HERSELF LET ME REMEMBER HOW IT USED TO BE AND BRING ONE MORNING BACK AGAIN I COME INTO THE SECONDBEST PARLOUR AFTER BREAKFAST WITH MY BOOKS AND AN EXERCISEBOOK AND A SLATE MY MOTHER IS READY FOR ME AT HER WRITINGDESK BUT NOT HALF SO READY AS MR MURDSTONE IN HIS EASYCHAIR BY THE WINDOW THOUGH HE PRETENDS TO BE READING A BOOK OR AS MISS MURDSTONE SITTING NEAR MY MOTHER STRINGING STEEL BEADS THE VERY SIGHT OF THESE TWO HAS SUCH AN INFLUENCE OVER ME THAT I BEGIN TO FEEL THE WORDS I HAVE BEEN AT INFINITE PAINS TO GET INTO MY HEAD ALL SLIDING AWAY AND GOING I DONT KNOW WHERE I WONDER WHERE THEY DO GO BY THE BY I HAND THE FIRST BOOK TO MY MOTHER PERHAPS IT IS A GRAMMAR PERHAPS A HISTORY OR GEOGRAPHY I TAKE A LAST DROWNING LOOK AT THE PAGE AS I GIVE IT INTO HER HAND AND START OFF ALOUD AT A RACING PACE WHILE I HAVE GOT IT FRESH I TRIP OVER A WORD MR MURDSTONE LOOKS UP I TRIP OVER ANOTHER WORD MISS MURDSTONE LOOKS UP I REDDEN TUMBLE OVER HALFADOZEN WORDS AND STOP I THINK MY MOTHER WOULD SHOW ME THE BOOK IF SHE DARED BUT SHE DOES NOT DARE AND SHE SAYS SOFTLY OH DAVY DAVY NOW CLARA SAYS MR MURDSTONE BE FIRM WITH THE BOY DONT SAY OH DAVY DAVY THATS CHILDISH HE KNOWS HIS LESSON OR HE DOES NOT KNOW IT HE DOES NOT KNOW IT MISS MURDSTONE INTERPOSES AWFULLY I AM REALLY AFRAID HE DOES NOT SAYS MY MOTHER THEN YOU SEE CLARA RETURNS MISS MURDSTONE YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE HIM THE BOOK BACK AND MAKE HIM KNOW IT YES CERTAINLY SAYS MY MOTHER THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO MY DEAR JANE NOW DAVY TRY ONCE MORE AND DONT BE STUPID I OBEY THE FIRST CLAUSE OF THE INJUNCTION BY TRYING ONCE MORE BUT AM NOT SO SUCCESSFUL WITH THE SECOND FOR I AM VERY STUPID I TUMBLE DOWN BEFORE I GET TO THE OLD PLACE AT A POINT WHERE I WAS ALL RIGHT BEFORE AND STOP TO THINK BUT I CANT THINK ABOUT THE LESSON I THINK OF THE NUMBER OF YARDS OF NET IN MISS MURDSTONES CAP OR OF THE PRICE OF MR MURDSTONES DRESSINGGOWN OR ANY SUCH RIDICULOUS PROBLEM THAT I HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH AND DONT WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH MR MURDSTONE MAKES A MOVEMENT OF IMPATIENCE WHICH I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING FOR A LONG TIME MISS MURDSTONE DOES THE SAME MY MOTHER GLANCES SUBMISSIVELY AT THEM SHUTS THE BOOK AND LAYS IT BY AS AN ARREAR TO BE WORKED OUT WHEN MY OTHER TASKS ARE DONE THERE IS A PILE OF THESE ARREARS VERY SOON AND IT SWELLS LIKE A ROLLING SNOWBALL THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE STUPID I GET THE CASE IS SO HOPELESS AND I FEEL THAT I AM WALLOWING IN SUCH A BOG OF NONSENSE THAT I GIVE UP ALL IDEA OF GETTING OUT AND ABANDON MYSELF TO MY FATE THE DESPAIRING WAY IN WHICH MY MOTHER AND I LOOK AT EACH OTHER AS I BLUNDER ON IS TRULY MELANCHOLY BUT THE GREATEST EFFECT IN THESE MISERABLE LESSONS IS WHEN MY MOTHER THINKING NOBODY IS OBSERVING HER TRIES TO GIVE ME THE CUE BY THE MOTION OF HER LIPS AT THAT INSTANT MISS MURDSTONE WHO HAS BEEN LYING IN WAIT FOR NOTHING ELSE ALL ALONG SAYS IN A DEEP WARNING VOICE CLARA MY MOTHER STARTS COLOURS AND SMILES FAINTLY MR MURDSTONE COMES OUT OF HIS CHAIR TAKES THE BOOK THROWS IT AT ME OR BOXES MY EARS WITH IT AND TURNS ME OUT OF THE ROOM BY THE SHOULDERS EVEN WHEN THE LESSONS ARE DONE THE WORST IS YET TO HAPPEN IN THE SHAPE OF AN APPALLING SUM THIS IS INVENTED FOR ME AND DELIVERED TO ME ORALLY BY MR MURDSTONE AND BEGINS IF I GO INTO A CHEESEMONGERS SHOP AND BUY FIVE THOUSAND DOUBLEGLOUCESTER CHEESES AT FOURPENCEHALFPENNY EACH PRESENT PAYMENTAT WHICH I SEE MISS MURDSTONE SECRETLY OVERJOYED I PORE OVER THESE CHEESES WITHOUT ANY RESULT OR ENLIGHTENMENT UNTIL DINNERTIME WHEN HAVING MADE A MULATTO OF MYSELF BY GETTING THE DIRT OF THE SLATE INTO THE PORES OF MY SKIN I HAVE A SLICE OF BREAD TO HELP ME OUT WITH THE CHEESES AND AM CONSIDERED IN DISGRACE FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING IT SEEMS TO ME AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME AS IF MY UNFORTUNATE STUDIES GENERALLY TOOK THIS COURSE I COULD HAVE DONE VERY WELL IF I HAD BEEN WITHOUT THE MURDSTONES BUT THE INFLUENCE OF THE MURDSTONES UPON ME WAS LIKE THE FASCINATION OF TWO SNAKES ON A WRETCHED YOUNG BIRD EVEN WHEN I DID GET THROUGH THE MORNING WITH TOLERABLE CREDIT THERE WAS NOT MUCH GAINED BUT DINNER FOR MISS MURDSTONE NEVER COULD ENDURE TO SEE ME UNTASKED AND IF I RASHLY MADE ANY SHOW OF BEING UNEMPLOYED CALLED HER BROTHERS ATTENTION TO ME BY SAYING CLARA MY DEAR THERES NOTHING LIKE WORKGIVE YOUR BOY AN EXERCISE WHICH CAUSED ME TO BE CLAPPED DOWN TO SOME NEW LABOUR THERE AND THEN AS TO ANY RECREATION WITH OTHER CHILDREN OF MY AGE I HAD VERY LITTLE OF THAT FOR THE GLOOMY THEOLOGY OF THE MURDSTONES MADE ALL CHILDREN OUT TO BE A SWARM OF LITTLE VIPERS THOUGH THERE WAS A CHILD ONCE SET IN THE MIDST OF THE DISCIPLES AND HELD THAT THEY CONTAMINATED ONE ANOTHER THE NATURAL RESULT OF THIS TREATMENT CONTINUED I SUPPOSE FOR SOME SIX MONTHS OR MORE WAS TO MAKE ME SULLEN DULL AND DOGGED I WAS NOT MADE THE LESS SO BY MY SENSE OF BEING DAILY MORE AND MORE SHUT OUT AND ALIENATED FROM MY MOTHER I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST STUPEFIED BUT FOR ONE CIRCUMSTANCE IT WAS THIS MY FATHER HAD LEFT A SMALL COLLECTION OF BOOKS IN A LITTLE ROOM UPSTAIRS TO WHICH I HAD ACCESS FOR IT ADJOINED MY OWN AND WHICH NOBODY ELSE IN OUR HOUSE EVER TROUBLED FROM THAT BLESSED LITTLE ROOM RODERICK RANDOM PEREGRINE PICKLE HUMPHREY CLINKER TOM JONES THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD DON QUIXOTE GIL BLAS AND ROBINSON CRUSOE CAME OUT A GLORIOUS HOST TO KEEP ME COMPANY THEY KEPT ALIVE MY FANCY AND MY HOPE OF SOMETHING BEYOND THAT PLACE AND TIMETHEY AND THE ARABIAN NIGHTS AND THE TALES OF THE GENIIAND DID ME NO HARM FOR WHATEVER HARM WAS IN SOME OF THEM WAS NOT THERE FOR ME I KNEW NOTHING OF IT IT IS ASTONISHING TO ME NOW HOW I FOUND TIME IN THE MIDST OF MY PORINGS AND BLUNDERINGS OVER HEAVIER THEMES TO READ THOSE BOOKS AS I DID IT IS CURIOUS TO ME HOW I COULD EVER HAVE CONSOLED MYSELF UNDER MY SMALL TROUBLES WHICH WERE GREAT TROUBLES TO ME BY IMPERSONATING MY FAVOURITE CHARACTERS IN THEMAS I DIDAND BY PUTTING MR AND MISS MURDSTONE INTO ALL THE BAD ONESWHICH I DID TOO I HAVE BEEN TOM JONES A CHILDS TOM JONES A HARMLESS CREATURE FOR A WEEK TOGETHER I HAVE SUSTAINED MY OWN IDEA OF RODERICK RANDOM FOR A MONTH AT A STRETCH I VERILY BELIEVE I HAD A GREEDY RELISH FOR A FEW VOLUMES OF VOYAGES AND TRAVELSI FORGET WHAT NOWTHAT WERE ON THOSE SHELVES AND FOR DAYS AND DAYS I CAN REMEMBER TO HAVE GONE ABOUT MY REGION OF OUR HOUSE ARMED WITH THE CENTREPIECE OUT OF AN OLD SET OF BOOTTREESTHE PERFECT REALIZATION OF CAPTAIN SOMEBODY OF THE ROYAL BRITISH NAVY IN DANGER OF BEING BESET BY SAVAGES AND RESOLVED TO SELL HIS LIFE AT A GREAT PRICE THE CAPTAIN NEVER LOST DIGNITY FROM HAVING HIS EARS BOXED WITH THE LATIN GRAMMAR I DID BUT THE CAPTAIN WAS A CAPTAIN AND A HERO IN DESPITE OF ALL THE GRAMMARS OF ALL THE LANGUAGES IN THE WORLD DEAD OR ALIVE THIS WAS MY ONLY AND MY CONSTANT COMFORT WHEN I THINK OF IT THE PICTURE ALWAYS RISES IN MY MIND OF A SUMMER EVENING THE BOYS AT PLAY IN THE CHURCHYARD AND I SITTING ON MY BED READING AS IF FOR LIFE EVERY BARN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD EVERY STONE IN THE CHURCH AND EVERY FOOT OF THE CHURCHYARD HAD SOME ASSOCIATION OF ITS OWN IN MY MIND CONNECTED WITH THESE BOOKS AND STOOD FOR SOME LOCALITY MADE FAMOUS IN THEM I HAVE SEEN TOM PIPES GO CLIMBING UP THE CHURCHSTEEPLE I HAVE WATCHED STRAP WITH THE KNAPSACK ON HIS BACK STOPPING TO REST HIMSELF UPON THE WICKETGATE AND I KNOW THAT COMMODORE TRUNNION HELD THAT CLUB WITH MR PICKLE IN THE PARLOUR OF OUR LITTLE VILLAGE ALEHOUSE THE READER NOW UNDERSTANDS AS WELL AS I DO WHAT I WAS WHEN I CAME TO THAT POINT OF MY YOUTHFUL HISTORY TO WHICH I AM NOW COMING AGAIN ONE MORNING WHEN I WENT INTO THE PARLOUR WITH MY BOOKS I FOUND MY MOTHER LOOKING ANXIOUS MISS MURDSTONE LOOKING FIRM AND MR MURDSTONE BINDING SOMETHING ROUND THE BOTTOM OF A CANEA LITHE AND LIMBER CANE WHICH HE LEFT OFF BINDING WHEN I CAME IN AND POISED AND SWITCHED IN THE AIR I TELL YOU CLARA SAID MR MURDSTONE I HAVE BEEN OFTEN FLOGGED MYSELF TO BE SURE OF COURSE SAID MISS MURDSTONE CERTAINLY MY DEAR JANE FALTERED MY MOTHER MEEKLY BUTBUT DO YOU THINK IT DID EDWARD GOOD DO YOU THINK IT DID EDWARD HARM CLARA ASKED MR MURDSTONE GRAVELY THATS THE POINT SAID HIS SISTER TO THIS MY MOTHER RETURNED CERTAINLY MY DEAR JANE AND SAID NO MORE I FELT APPREHENSIVE THAT I WAS PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN THIS DIALOGUE AND SOUGHT MR MURDSTONES EYE AS IT LIGHTED ON MINE NOW DAVID HE SAIDAND I SAW THAT CAST AGAIN AS HE SAID ITYOU MUST BE FAR MORE CAREFUL TODAY THAN USUAL HE GAVE THE CANE ANOTHER POISE AND ANOTHER SWITCH AND HAVING FINISHED HIS PREPARATION OF IT LAID IT DOWN BESIDE HIM WITH AN IMPRESSIVE LOOK AND TOOK UP HIS BOOK THIS WAS A GOOD FRESHENER TO MY PRESENCE OF MIND AS A BEGINNING I FELT THE WORDS OF MY LESSONS SLIPPING OFF NOT ONE BY ONE OR LINE BY LINE BUT BY THE ENTIRE PAGE I TRIED TO LAY HOLD OF THEM BUT THEY SEEMED IF I MAY SO EXPRESS IT TO HAVE PUT SKATES ON AND TO SKIM AWAY FROM ME WITH A SMOOTHNESS THERE WAS NO CHECKING WE BEGAN BADLY AND WENT ON WORSE I HAD COME IN WITH AN IDEA OF DISTINGUISHING MYSELF RATHER CONCEIVING THAT I WAS VERY WELL PREPARED BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE A MISTAKE BOOK AFTER BOOK WAS ADDED TO THE HEAP OF FAILURES MISS MURDSTONE BEING FIRMLY WATCHFUL OF US ALL THE TIME AND WHEN WE CAME AT LAST TO THE FIVE THOUSAND CHEESES CANES HE MADE IT THAT DAY I REMEMBER MY MOTHER BURST OUT CRYING CLARA SAID MISS MURDSTONE IN HER WARNING VOICE I AM NOT QUITE WELL MY DEAR JANE I THINK SAID MY MOTHER I SAW HIM WINK SOLEMNLY AT HIS SISTER AS HE ROSE AND SAID TAKING UP THE CANE WHY JANE WE CAN HARDLY EXPECT CLARA TO BEAR WITH PERFECT FIRMNESS THE WORRY AND TORMENT THAT DAVID HAS OCCASIONED HER TODAY THAT WOULD BE STOICAL CLARA IS GREATLY STRENGTHENED AND IMPROVED BUT WE CAN HARDLY EXPECT SO MUCH FROM HER DAVID YOU AND I WILL GO UPSTAIRS BOY AS HE TOOK ME OUT AT THE DOOR MY MOTHER RAN TOWARDS US MISS MURDSTONE SAID CLARA ARE YOU A PERFECT FOOL AND INTERFERED I SAW MY MOTHER STOP HER EARS THEN AND I HEARD HER CRYING HE WALKED ME UP TO MY ROOM SLOWLY AND GRAVELYI AM CERTAIN HE HAD A DELIGHT IN THAT FORMAL PARADE OF EXECUTING JUSTICEAND WHEN WE GOT THERE SUDDENLY TWISTED MY HEAD UNDER HIS ARM MR MURDSTONE SIR I CRIED TO HIM DONT PRAY DONT BEAT ME I HAVE TRIED TO LEARN SIR BUT I CANT LEARN WHILE YOU AND MISS MURDSTONE ARE BY I CANT INDEED CANT YOU INDEED DAVID HE SAID WELL TRY THAT HE HAD MY HEAD AS IN A VICE BUT I TWINED ROUND HIM SOMEHOW AND STOPPED HIM FOR A MOMENT ENTREATING HIM NOT TO BEAT ME IT WAS ONLY A MOMENT THAT I STOPPED HIM FOR HE CUT ME HEAVILY AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS AND IN THE SAME INSTANT I CAUGHT THE HAND WITH WHICH HE HELD ME IN MY MOUTH BETWEEN MY TEETH AND BIT IT THROUGH IT SETS MY TEETH ON EDGE TO THINK OF IT HE BEAT ME THEN AS IF HE WOULD HAVE BEATEN ME TO DEATH ABOVE ALL THE NOISE WE MADE I HEARD THEM RUNNING UP THE STAIRS AND CRYING OUTI HEARD MY MOTHER CRYING OUTAND PEGGOTTY THEN HE WAS GONE AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED OUTSIDE AND I WAS LYING FEVERED AND HOT AND TORN AND SORE AND RAGING IN MY PUNY WAY UPON THE FLOOR HOW WELL I RECOLLECT WHEN I BECAME QUIET WHAT AN UNNATURAL STILLNESS SEEMED TO REIGN THROUGH THE WHOLE HOUSE HOW WELL I REMEMBER WHEN MY SMART AND PASSION BEGAN TO COOL HOW WICKED I BEGAN TO FEEL I SAT LISTENING FOR A LONG WHILE BUT THERE WAS NOT A SOUND I CRAWLED UP FROM THE FLOOR AND SAW MY FACE IN THE GLASS SO SWOLLEN RED AND UGLY THAT IT ALMOST FRIGHTENED ME MY STRIPES WERE SORE AND STIFF AND MADE ME CRY AFRESH WHEN I MOVED BUT THEY WERE NOTHING TO THE GUILT I FELT IT LAY HEAVIER ON MY BREAST THAN IF I HAD BEEN A MOST ATROCIOUS CRIMINAL I DARE SAY IT HAD BEGUN TO GROW DARK AND I HAD SHUT THE WINDOW I HAD BEEN LYING FOR THE MOST PART WITH MY HEAD UPON THE SILL BY TURNS CRYING DOZING AND LOOKING LISTLESSLY OUT WHEN THE KEY WAS TURNED AND MISS MURDSTONE CAME IN WITH SOME BREAD AND MEAT AND MILK THESE SHE PUT DOWN UPON THE TABLE WITHOUT A WORD GLARING AT ME THE WHILE WITH EXEMPLARY FIRMNESS AND THEN RETIRED LOCKING THE DOOR AFTER HER LONG AFTER IT WAS DARK I SAT THERE WONDERING WHETHER ANYBODY ELSE WOULD COME WHEN THIS APPEARED IMPROBABLE FOR THAT NIGHT I UNDRESSED AND WENT TO BED AND THERE I BEGAN TO WONDER FEARFULLY WHAT WOULD BE DONE TO ME WHETHER IT WAS A CRIMINAL ACT THAT I HAD COMMITTED WHETHER I SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AND SENT TO PRISON WHETHER I WAS AT ALL IN DANGER OF BEING HANGED I NEVER SHALL FORGET THE WAKING NEXT MORNING THE BEING CHEERFUL AND FRESH FOR THE FIRST MOMENT AND THEN THE BEING WEIGHED DOWN BY THE STALE AND DISMAL OPPRESSION OF REMEMBRANCE MISS MURDSTONE REAPPEARED BEFORE I WAS OUT OF BED TOLD ME IN SO MANY WORDS THAT I WAS FREE TO WALK IN THE GARDEN FOR HALF AN HOUR AND NO LONGER AND RETIRED LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN THAT I MIGHT AVAIL MYSELF OF THAT PERMISSION I DID SO AND DID SO EVERY MORNING OF MY IMPRISONMENT WHICH LASTED FIVE DAYS IF I COULD HAVE SEEN MY MOTHER ALONE I SHOULD HAVE GONE DOWN ON MY KNEES TO HER AND BESOUGHT HER FORGIVENESS BUT I SAW NO ONE MISS MURDSTONE EXCEPTED DURING THE WHOLE TIMEEXCEPT AT EVENING PRAYERS IN THE PARLOUR TO WHICH I WAS ESCORTED BY MISS MURDSTONE AFTER EVERYBODY ELSE WAS PLACED WHERE I WAS STATIONED A YOUNG OUTLAW ALL ALONE BY MYSELF NEAR THE DOOR AND WHENCE I WAS SOLEMNLY CONDUCTED BY MY JAILER BEFORE ANY ONE AROSE FROM THE DEVOTIONAL POSTURE I ONLY OBSERVED THAT MY MOTHER WAS AS FAR OFF FROM ME AS SHE COULD BE AND KEPT HER FACE ANOTHER WAY SO THAT I NEVER SAW IT AND THAT MR MURDSTONES HAND WAS BOUND UP IN A LARGE LINEN WRAPPER THE LENGTH OF THOSE FIVE DAYS I CAN CONVEY NO IDEA OF TO ANY ONE THEY OCCUPY THE PLACE OF YEARS IN MY REMEMBRANCE THE WAY IN WHICH I LISTENED TO ALL THE INCIDENTS OF THE HOUSE THAT MADE THEMSELVES AUDIBLE TO ME THE RINGING OF BELLS THE OPENING AND SHUTTING OF DOORS THE MURMURING OF VOICES THE FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS TO ANY LAUGHING WHISTLING OR SINGING OUTSIDE WHICH SEEMED MORE DISMAL THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO ME IN MY SOLITUDE AND DISGRACETHE UNCERTAIN PACE OF THE HOURS ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT WHEN I WOULD WAKE THINKING IT WAS MORNING AND FIND THAT THE FAMILY WERE NOT YET GONE TO BED AND THAT ALL THE LENGTH OF NIGHT HAD YET TO COMETHE DEPRESSED DREAMS AND NIGHTMARES I HADTHE RETURN OF DAY NOON AFTERNOON EVENING WHEN THE BOYS PLAYED IN THE CHURCHYARD AND I WATCHED THEM FROM A DISTANCE WITHIN THE ROOM BEING ASHAMED TO SHOW MYSELF AT THE WINDOW LEST THEY SHOULD KNOW I WAS A PRISONERTHE STRANGE SENSATION OF NEVER HEARING MYSELF SPEAKTHE FLEETING INTERVALS OF SOMETHING LIKE CHEERFULNESS WHICH CAME WITH EATING AND DRINKING AND WENT AWAY WITH ITTHE SETTING IN OF RAIN ONE EVENING WITH A FRESH SMELL AND ITS COMING DOWN FASTER AND FASTER BETWEEN ME AND THE CHURCH UNTIL IT AND GATHERING NIGHT SEEMED TO QUENCH ME IN GLOOM AND FEAR AND REMORSEALL THIS APPEARS TO HAVE GONE ROUND AND ROUND FOR YEARS INSTEAD OF DAYS IT IS SO VIVIDLY AND STRONGLY STAMPED ON MY REMEMBRANCE ON THE LAST NIGHT OF MY RESTRAINT I WAS AWAKENED BY HEARING MY OWN NAME SPOKEN IN A WHISPER I STARTED UP IN BED AND PUTTING OUT MY ARMS IN THE DARK SAID IS THAT YOU PEGGOTTY THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE ANSWER BUT PRESENTLY I HEARD MY NAME AGAIN IN A TONE SO VERY MYSTERIOUS AND AWFUL THAT I THINK I SHOULD HAVE GONE INTO A FIT IF IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IT MUST HAVE COME THROUGH THE KEYHOLE I GROPED MY WAY TO THE DOOR AND PUTTING MY OWN LIPS TO THE KEYHOLE WHISPERED IS THAT YOU PEGGOTTY DEAR YES MY OWN PRECIOUS DAVY SHE REPLIED BE AS SOFT AS A MOUSE OR THE CATLL HEAR US I UNDERSTOOD THIS TO MEAN MISS MURDSTONE AND WAS SENSIBLE OF THE

NO NOT VERY WHAT IS GOING TO BE DONE WITH ME PEGGOTTY DEAR DO YOU KNOW SCHOOL NEAR LONDON WAS PEGGOTTYS ANSWER I WAS OBLIGED TO GET HER TO REPEAT IT FOR SHE SPOKE IT THE FIRST TIME QUITE DOWN MY THROAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF MY HAVING FORGOTTEN TO TAKE MY MOUTH AWAY FROM THE KEYHOLE AND PUT MY EAR THERE AND THOUGH HER WORDS TICKLED ME A GOOD DEAL I DIDNT HEAR THEM WHEN PEGGOTTY TOMORROW IS THAT THE REASON WHY MISS MURDSTONE TOOK THE CLOTHES OUT OF MY DRAWERS WHICH SHE HAD DONE THOUGH I HAVE FORGOTTEN TO MENTION IT YES SAID PEGGOTTY BOX SHANT I SEE MAMA YES SAID PEGGOTTY MORNING THEN PEGGOTTY FITTED HER MOUTH CLOSE TO THE KEYHOLE AND DELIVERED THESE WORDS THROUGH IT WITH AS MUCH FEELING AND EARNESTNESS AS A KEYHOLE HAS EVER BEEN THE MEDIUM OF COMMUNICATING I WILL VENTURE TO ASSERT SHOOTING

PATTED IT WITH MY HAND I RECOLLECT AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER HONEST FACEAND PARTED FROM THAT NIGHT THERE GREW UP IN MY BREAST A FEELING FOR PEGGOTTY WHICH I CANNOT VERY WELL DEFINE SHE DID NOT REPLACE MY MOTHER NO ONE COULD DO THAT BUT SHE CAME INTO A VACANCY IN MY HEART WHICH CLOSED UPON HER AND I FELT TOWARDS HER SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER FELT FOR ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING IT WAS A SORT OF COMICAL AFFECTION TOO AND YET IF SHE HAD DIED I CANNOT THINK WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE OR HOW I SHOULD HAVE ACTED OUT THE TRAGEDY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ME IN THE MORNING MISS MURDSTONE APPEARED AS USUAL AND TOLD ME I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL WHICH WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SUCH NEWS TO ME AS SHE SUPPOSED SHE ALSO INFORMED ME THAT WHEN I WAS DRESSED I WAS TO COME DOWNSTAIRS INTO THE PARLOUR AND HAVE MY BREAKFAST THERE I FOUND MY MOTHER VERY PALE AND WITH RED EYES INTO WHOSE ARMS I RAN AND BEGGED HER PARDON FROM MY SUFFERING SOUL OH DAVY SHE SAID THAT YOU COULD HURT ANYONE I LOVE TRY TO BE BETTER PRAY TO BE BETTER I FORGIVE YOU BUT I AM SO GRIEVED DAVY THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE SUCH BAD PASSIONS IN YOUR HEART THEY HAD PERSUADED HER THAT I WAS A WICKED FELLOW AND SHE WAS MORE SORRY FOR THAT THAN FOR MY GOING

MURDSTONE AND THAN LOOK DOWN OR LOOK AWAY MASTER COPPERFIELDS BOX THERE SAID MISS MURDSTONE WHEN WHEELS WERE HEARD AT THE GATE I LOOKED FOR PEGGOTTY BUT IT WAS NOT SHE NEITHER SHE NOR MR MURDSTONE APPEARED MY FORMER ACQUAINTANCE THE CARRIER WAS AT THE DOOR THE BOX WAS TAKEN OUT TO HIS CART AND LIFTED IN CLARA SAID MISS MURDSTONE IN HER WARNING NOTE READY MY DEAR JANE RETURNED MY MOTHER GOODBYE

FORGIVE YOU MY DEAR BOY GOD BLESS YOU CLARA MISS MURDSTONE REPEATED MISS MURDSTONE WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO TAKE ME OUT TO THE CART AND TO SAY ON THE WAY THAT SHE HOPED I WOULD REPENT BEFORE I CAME TO A BAD END AND THEN I GOT INTO THE CART AND THE LAZY HORSE WALKED OFF WITH IT CHAPTER I AM SENT AWAY FROM HOME WE MIGHT HAVE GONE ABOUT HALF A MILE AND MY POCKETHANDKERCHIEF WAS QUITE WET THROUGH WHEN THE CARRIER STOPPED SHORT LOOKING OUT TO ASCERTAIN FOR WHAT I SAW TO MY AMAZEMENT PEGGOTTY BURST FROM A HEDGE AND CLIMB INTO THE CART SHE TOOK ME IN BOTH HER ARMS AND SQUEEZED ME TO HER STAYS UNTIL THE PRESSURE ON MY NOSE WAS EXTREMELY PAINFUL THOUGH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT TILL AFTERWARDS WHEN I FOUND IT VERY TENDER NOT A SINGLE WORD DID PEGGOTTY SPEAK RELEASING ONE OF HER ARMS SHE PUT IT DOWN IN HER POCKET TO THE ELBOW AND BROUGHT OUT SOME PAPER BAGS OF CAKES WHICH SHE CRAMMED INTO MY POCKETS AND A PURSE WHICH SHE PUT INTO MY HAND BUT NOT ONE WORD DID SHE SAY AFTER ANOTHER AND A FINAL SQUEEZE WITH BOTH ARMS SHE GOT DOWN FROM THE CART AND RAN AWAY AND MY BELIEF IS AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITHOUT A SOLITARY BUTTON ON HER GOWN I PICKED UP ONE OF SEVERAL THAT WERE ROLLING ABOUT AND TREASURED IT AS A KEEPSAKE FOR A LONG TIME THE CARRIER LOOKED AT ME AS IF TO INQUIRE IF SHE WERE COMING BACK I SHOOK MY HEAD AND SAID I THOUGHT NOT THEN COME UP SAID THE CARRIER TO THE LAZY HORSE WHO CAME UP ACCORDINGLY HAVING BY THIS TIME CRIED AS MUCH AS I POSSIBLY COULD I BEGAN TO THINK IT WAS OF NO USE CRYING ANY MORE ESPECIALLY AS NEITHER RODERICK RANDOM NOR THAT CAPTAIN IN THE ROYAL BRITISH NAVY HAD EVER CRIED THAT I COULD REMEMBER IN TRYING SITUATIONS THE CARRIER SEEING ME IN THIS RESOLUTION PROPOSED THAT MY POCKETHANDKERCHIEF SHOULD BE SPREAD UPON THE HORSES BACK TO DRY I THANKED HIM AND ASSENTED AND PARTICULARLY SMALL IT LOOKED UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD NOW LEISURE TO EXAMINE THE PURSE IT WAS A STIFF LEATHER PURSE WITH A SNAP AND HAD THREE BRIGHT SHILLINGS IN IT WHICH PEGGOTTY HAD EVIDENTLY POLISHED UP WITH WHITENING FOR MY GREATER DELIGHT BUT ITS MOST PRECIOUS CONTENTS WERE TWO HALFCROWNS FOLDED TOGETHER IN A BIT OF PAPER ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN MY MOTHERS HAND FOR DAVY WITH MY LOVE I WAS SO OVERCOME BY THIS THAT I ASKED THE CARRIER TO BE SO GOOD AS TO REACH ME MY POCKETHANDKERCHIEF AGAIN BUT HE SAID HE THOUGHT I HAD BETTER DO WITHOUT IT AND I THOUGHT I REALLY HAD SO I WIPED MY EYES ON MY SLEEVE AND STOPPED MYSELF FOR GOOD TOO THOUGH IN CONSEQUENCE OF MY PREVIOUS EMOTIONS I WAS STILL OCCASIONALLY SEIZED WITH A STORMY SOB AFTER WE HAD JOGGED ON FOR SOME LITTLE TIME I ASKED THE CARRIER IF HE WAS GOING ALL THE WAY ALL THE WAY WHERE INQUIRED THE CARRIER THERE I SAID WHERES THERE INQUIRED THE CARRIER NEAR LONDON I SAID WHY THAT HORSE SAID THE CARRIER JERKING THE REIN TO POINT HIM OUT WOULD BE DEADER THAN PORK AFORE HE GOT OVER HALF THE GROUND ARE YOU ONLY GOING TO YARMOUTH THEN I ASKED THATS ABOUT IT SAID THE CARRIER AND THERE I SHALL TAKE YOU TO THE STAGECUTCH AND THE STAGECUTCH THATLL TAKE YOU TOWHEREVER IT IS AS THIS WAS A GREAT DEAL FOR THE CARRIER WHOSE NAME WAS MR BARKIS TO SAYHE BEING AS I OBSERVED IN A FORMER CHAPTER OF A PHLEGMATIC TEMPERAMENT AND NOT AT ALL CONVERSATIONALI OFFERED HIM A CAKE AS A MARK OF ATTENTION WHICH HE ATE AT ONE GULP EXACTLY LIKE AN ELEPHANT AND WHICH MADE NO MORE IMPRESSION ON HIS BIG FACE THAN IT WOULD HAVE DONE ON AN ELEPHANTS DID SHE MAKE EM NOW SAID MR BARKIS ALWAYS LEANING FORWARD IN HIS SLOUCHING WAY ON THE FOOTBOARD OF THE CART WITH AN ARM ON EACH KNEE PEGGOTTY DO YOU MEAN SIR AH SAID MR BARKIS HER YES SHE MAKES ALL OUR PASTRY AND DOES ALL OUR COOKING DO SHE THOUGH SAID MR BARKIS HE MADE UP HIS MOUTH AS IF TO WHISTLE BUT HE DIDNT WHISTLE HE SAT LOOKING AT THE HORSES EARS AS IF HE SAW SOMETHING NEW THERE AND SAT SO FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME BY AND BY HE SAID NO SWEETHEARTS I BLIEVE SWEETMEATS DID YOU SAY MR BARKIS FOR I THOUGHT HE WANTED SOMETHING ELSE TO EAT AND HAD POINTEDLY ALLUDED TO THAT DESCRIPTION OF REFRESHMENT HEARTS SAID MR BARKIS SWEET HEARTS NO PERSON WALKS WITH HER WITH PEGGOTTY AH HE SAID HER OH NO SHE NEVER HAD A SWEETHEART DIDNT SHE THOUGH SAID MR BARKIS

TOWARDS ME WELL IF YOU WAS WRITIN TO HER PRAPS YOUD RECOLLECT TO SAY THAT BARKIS WAS WILLIN WOULD YOU THAT BARKIS IS WILLING I REPEATED INNOCENTLY IS THAT ALL THE MESSAGE YEES HE SAID CONSIDERING YEES BARKIS IS WILLIN BUT YOU WILL BE AT BLUNDERSTONE AGAIN TOMORROW MR BARKIS I SAID FALTERING A LITTLE AT THE IDEA OF MY BEING FAR AWAY FROM IT THEN AND COULD GIVE YOUR OWN MESSAGE SO MUCH BETTER AS HE REPUDIATED THIS SUGGESTION HOWEVER WITH A JERK OF HIS HEAD AND ONCE MORE CONFIRMED HIS PREVIOUS REQUEST BY SAYING WITH PROFOUND GRAVITY BARKIS IS WILLIN THATS THE MESSAGE I READILY UNDERTOOK ITS TRANSMISSION WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR THE COACH IN THE HOTEL AT YARMOUTH THAT VERY AFTERNOON I PROCURED A SHEET OF PAPER AND AN INKSTAND AND WROTE A NOTE TO PEGGOTTY WHICH RAN THUS MY DEAR PEGGOTTY I HAVE COME HERE SAFE BARKIS IS WILLING MY LOVE TO MAMA YOURS AFFECTIONATELY PS HE SAYS HE PARTICULARLY WANTS YOU TO KNOWBARKIS IS WILLING WHEN I HAD TAKEN THIS COMMISSION ON MYSELF PROSPECTIVELY MR BARKIS RELAPSED INTO PERFECT SILENCE AND I FEELING QUITE WORN OUT BY ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED LATELY LAY DOWN ON A SACK IN THE CART AND FELL ASLEEP I SLEPT SOUNDLY UNTIL WE GOT TO YARMOUTH WHICH WAS SO ENTIRELY NEW AND STRANGE TO ME IN THE INNYARD TO WHICH WE DROVE THAT I AT ONCE ABANDONED A LATENT HOPE I HAD HAD OF MEETING WITH SOME OF MR PEGGOTTYS FAMILY THERE PERHAPS EVEN WITH LITTLE EMLY HERSELF THE COACH WAS IN THE YARD SHINING VERY MUCH ALL OVER BUT WITHOUT ANY HORSES TO IT AS YET AND IT LOOKED IN THAT STATE AS IF NOTHING WAS MORE UNLIKELY THAN ITS EVER GOING TO LONDON I WAS THINKING THIS AND WONDERING WHAT WOULD ULTIMATELY BECOME OF MY BOX WHICH MR BARKIS HAD PUT DOWN ON THE YARDPAVEMENT BY THE POLE HE HAVING DRIVEN UP THE YARD TO TURN HIS CART AND ALSO WHAT WOULD ULTIMATELY BECOME OF ME WHEN A LADY LOOKED OUT OF A BOWWINDOW WHERE SOME FOWLS AND JOINTS OF MEAT WERE HANGING UP AND SAID IS THAT THE LITTLE GENTLEMAN FROM BLUNDERSTONE YES MAAM I SAID WHAT NAME INQUIRED THE LADY COPPERFIELD MAAM I SAID THAT WONT DO RETURNED THE LADY NOBODYS DINNER IS PAID FOR HERE IN THAT NAME IS IT MURDSTONE MAAM I SAID IF YOURE MASTER MURDSTONE SAID THE LADY WHY DO YOU GO AND GIVE ANOTHER NAME FIRST I EXPLAINED TO THE LADY HOW IT WAS WHO THAN RANG A BELL AND CALLED OUT WILLIAM SHOW THE COFFEEROOM UPON WHICH A WAITER CAME RUNNING OUT OF A KITCHEN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE YARD TO SHOW IT AND SEEMED A GOOD DEAL SURPRISED WHEN HE WAS ONLY TO SHOW IT TO ME IT WAS A LARGE LONG ROOM WITH SOME LARGE MAPS IN IT I DOUBT IF I COULD HAVE FELT MUCH STRANGER IF THE MAPS HAD BEEN REAL FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND I CAST AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM I FELT IT WAS TAKING A LIBERTY TO SIT DOWN WITH MY CAP IN MY HAND ON THE CORNER OF THE CHAIR NEAREST THE DOOR AND WHEN THE WAITER LAID A CLOTH ON PURPOSE FOR ME AND PUT A SET OF CASTORS ON IT I THINK I MUST HAVE TURNED RED ALL OVER WITH MODESTY HE BROUGHT ME SOME CHOPS AND VEGETABLES AND TOOK THE COVERS OFF IN SUCH A BOUNCING MANNER THAT I WAS AFRAID I MUST HAVE GIVEN HIM SOME OFFENCE BUT HE GREATLY RELIEVED MY MIND BY PUTTING A CHAIR FOR ME AT THE TABLE AND SAYING VERY AFFABLY NOW SIXFOOT COME ON I THANKED HIM AND TOOK MY SEAT AT THE BOARD BUT FOUND IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO HANDLE MY KNIFE AND FORK WITH ANYTHING LIKE DEXTERITY OR TO AVOID SPLASHING MYSELF WITH THE GRAVY WHILE HE WAS STANDING OPPOSITE STARING SO HARD AND MAKING ME BLUSH IN THE MOST DREADFUL MANNER EVERY TIME I CAUGHT HIS EYE AFTER WATCHING ME INTO THE SECOND CHOP HE SAID THERES HALF A PINT OF ALE FOR YOU WILL YOU HAVE IT NOW I THANKED HIM AND SAID YES UPON WHICH HE POURED IT OUT OF A JUG INTO A LARGE TUMBLER AND HELD IT UP AGAINST THE LIGHT AND MADE IT LOOK BEAUTIFUL MY EYE HE SAID IT SEEMS A GOOD DEAL DONT IT IT DOES SEEM A GOOD DEAL I ANSWERED WITH A SMILE FOR IT WAS QUITE DELIGHTFUL TO ME TO FIND HIM SO PLEASANT HE WAS A TWINKLINGEYED PIMPLEFACED MAN WITH HIS HAIR STANDING UPRIGHT ALL OVER HIS HEAD AND AS HE STOOD WITH ONE ARM AKIMBO HOLDING UP THE GLASS TO THE LIGHT WITH THE OTHER HAND HE LOOKED QUITE FRIENDLY THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN HERE YESTERDAY HE SAIDA STOUT GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF TOPSAWYERPERHAPS YOU KNOW HIM NO I SAID I DONT THINK IN BREECHES AND GAITERS BROADBRIMMED HAT GREY COAT SPECKLED CHOKER SAID THE WAITER NO I SAID BASHFULLY I HAVENT THE PLEASURE HE CAME IN HERE SAID THE WAITER LOOKING AT THE LIGHT THROUGH THE TUMBLER ORDERED A GLASS OF THIS ALEWOULD ORDER ITI TOLD HIM NOTDRANK IT AND FELL DEAD IT WAS TOO OLD FOR HIM IT OUGHTNT TO BE DRAWN THATS THE FACT I WAS VERY MUCH SHOCKED TO HEAR OF THIS MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT AND SAID I THOUGHT I HAD BETTER HAVE SOME WATER WHY YOU SEE SAID THE WAITER STILL LOOKING AT THE LIGHT THROUGH THE TUMBLER WITH ONE OF HIS EYES SHUT UP OUR PEOPLE DONT LIKE THINGS BEING ORDERED AND LEFT IT OFFENDS EM BUT ILL DRINK IT IF YOU LIKE IM USED TO IT AND USE IS EVERYTHING I DONT THINK ITLL HURT ME IF I THROW MY HEAD BACK AND TAKE IT OFF QUICK SHALL I I REPLIED THAT HE WOULD MUCH OBLIGE ME BY DRINKING IT IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD DO IT SAFELY BUT BY NO MEANS OTHERWISE WHEN HE DID THROW HIS HEAD BACK AND TAKE IT OFF QUICK I HAD A HORRIBLE FEAR I CONFESS OF SEEING HIM MEET THE FATE OF THE LAMENTED MR TOPSAWYER AND FALL LIFELESS ON THE CARPET BUT IT DIDNT HURT HIM ON THE CONTRARY I THOUGHT HE SEEMED THE FRESHER FOR IT WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE HE SAID PUTTING A FORK INTO MY DISH NOT CHOPS CHOPS I SAID LORD BLESS MY SOUL HE EXCLAIMED I DIDNT KNOW THEY WERE CHOPS WHY A CHOPS THE VERY THING TO TAKE OFF THE BAD EFFECTS OF THAT BEER AINT IT LUCKY SO HE TOOK A CHOP BY THE BONE IN ONE HAND AND A POTATO IN THE OTHER AND ATE AWAY WITH A VERY GOOD APPETITE TO MY EXTREME SATISFACTION HE AFTERWARDS TOOK ANOTHER CHOP AND ANOTHER POTATO AND AFTER THAT ANOTHER CHOP AND ANOTHER POTATO WHEN WE HAD DONE HE BROUGHT ME A PUDDING AND HAVING SET IT BEFORE ME SEEMED TO RUMINATE AND TO BECOME ABSENT IN HIS MIND FOR SOME MOMENTS HOWS THE PIE HE SAID ROUSING HIMSELF ITS A PUDDING I MADE ANSWER PUDDING HE EXCLAIMED WHY BLESS ME SO IT IS WHAT LOOKING AT IT NEARER YOU DONT MEAN TO SAY ITS A BATTERPUDDING YES IT IS INDEED WHY A BATTERPUDDING HE SAID TAKING UP A TABLESPOON IS MY FAVOURITE PUDDING AINT THAT LUCKY COME ON LITTLE UN AND LETS SEE WHOLL GET MOST THE WAITER CERTAINLY GOT MOST HE ENTREATED ME MORE THAN ONCE TO COME IN AND WIN BUT WHAT WITH HIS TABLESPOON TO MY TEASPOON HIS DISPATCH TO MY DISPATCH AND HIS APPETITE TO MY APPETITE I WAS LEFT FAR BEHIND AT THE FIRST MOUTHFUL AND HAD NO CHANCE WITH HIM I NEVER SAW ANYONE ENJOY A PUDDING SO MUCH I THINK AND HE LAUGHED WHEN IT WAS ALL GONE AS IF HIS ENJOYMENT OF IT LASTED STILL FINDING HIM SO VERY FRIENDLY AND COMPANIONABLE IT WAS THEN THAT I ASKED FOR THE PEN AND INK AND PAPER TO WRITE TO PEGGOTTY HE NOT ONLY BROUGHT IT IMMEDIATELY BUT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO LOOK OVER ME WHILE I WROTE THE LETTER WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT HE ASKED ME WHERE I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL I SAID NEAR LONDON WHICH WAS ALL I KNEW OH MY EYE HE SAID LOOKING VERY LOWSPIRITED I AM SORRY FOR THAT WHY I ASKED HIM OH LORD HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD THATS THE SCHOOL WHERE THEY BROKE THE BOYS RIBSTWO RIBSA LITTLE BOY HE WAS I SHOULD SAY HE WASLET ME SEEHOW OLD ARE YOU ABOUT I TOLD HIM BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE THATS JUST HIS AGE HE SAID HE WAS EIGHT YEARS AND SIX MONTHS OLD WHEN THEY BROKE HIS FIRST RIB EIGHT YEARS AND EIGHT MONTHS OLD WHEN THEY BROKE HIS SECOND AND DID FOR HIM I COULD NOT DISGUISE FROM MYSELF OR FROM THE WAITER THAT THIS WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE COINCIDENCE AND INQUIRED HOW IT WAS DONE HIS ANSWER WAS NOT CHEERING TO MY SPIRITS FOR IT CONSISTED OF TWO DISMAL WORDS WITH WHOPPING THE BLOWING OF THE COACHHORN IN THE YARD WAS A SEASONABLE DIVERSION WHICH MADE ME GET UP AND HESITATINGLY INQUIRE IN THE MINGLED PRIDE AND DIFFIDENCE OF HAVING A PURSE WHICH I TOOK OUT OF MY POCKET IF THERE WERE ANYTHING TO PAY THERES A SHEET OF LETTERPAPER HE RETURNED DID YOU EVER BUY A SHEET OF LETTERPAPER I COULD NOT REMEMBER THAT I EVER HAD ITS DEAR HE SAID ON ACCOUNT OF THE DUTY THREEPENCE THATS THE WAY WERE TAXED IN THIS COUNTRY THERES NOTHING ELSE EXCEPT THE WAITER NEVER MIND THE INK I LOSE BY THAT WHAT SHOULD YOUWHAT SHOULD IHOW MUCH OUGHT I TOWHAT WOULD IT BE RIGHT TO PAY THE WAITER IF YOU PLEASE I STAMMERED BLUSHING IF I HADNT A FAMILY AND THAT FAMILY HADNT THE COWPOCK SAID THE WAITER I WOULDNT TAKE A SIXPENCE IF I DIDNT SUPPORT A AGED PAIRINT AND A LOVELY SISTERHERE THE WAITER WAS GREATLY AGITATEDI WOULDNT TAKE A FARTHING IF I HAD A GOOD PLACE AND WAS TREATED WELL HERE I SHOULD BEG ACCEPTANCE OF A TRIFLE INSTEAD OF TAKING OF IT BUT I LIVE ON BROKEN WITTLESAND I SLEEP ON THE COALSHERE THE WAITER BURST INTO TEARS I WAS VERY MUCH CONCERNED FOR HIS MISFORTUNES AND FELT THAT ANY RECOGNITION SHORT OF NINEPENCE WOULD BE MERE BRUTALITY AND HARDNESS OF HEART THEREFORE I GAVE HIM ONE OF MY THREE BRIGHT SHILLINGS WHICH HE RECEIVED WITH MUCH HUMILITY AND VENERATION AND SPUN UP WITH HIS THUMB DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS TO TRY THE GOODNESS OF IT WAS A LITTLE DISCONCERTING TO ME TO FIND WHEN I WAS BEING HELPED UP BEHIND THE COACH THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE EATEN ALL THE DINNER WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE I DISCOVERED THIS FROM OVERHEARING THE LADY IN THE BOWWINDOW SAY TO THE GUARD TAKE CARE OF THAT CHILD GEORGE OR HELL BURST AND FROM OBSERVING THAT THE WOMENSERVANTS WHO WERE ABOUT THE PLACE CAME OUT TO LOOK AND GIGGLE AT ME AS A YOUNG PHENOMENON MY UNFORTUNATE FRIEND THE WAITER WHO HAD QUITE RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DISTURBED BY THIS BUT JOINED IN THE GENERAL ADMIRATION WITHOUT BEING AT ALL CONFUSED IF I HAD ANY DOUBT OF HIM I SUPPOSE THIS HALF AWAKENED IT BUT I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT WITH THE SIMPLE CONFIDENCE OF A CHILD AND THE NATURAL RELIANCE OF A CHILD UPON SUPERIOR YEARS QUALITIES I AM VERY SORRY ANY CHILDREN SHOULD PREMATURELY CHANGE FOR WORLDLY WISDOM I HAD NO SERIOUS MISTRUST OF HIM ON THE WHOLE EVEN THEN I FELT IT RATHER HARD I MUST OWN TO BE MADE WITHOUT DESERVING IT THE SUBJECT OF JOKES BETWEEN THE COACHMAN AND GUARD AS TO THE COACH DRAWING HEAVY BEHIND ON ACCOUNT OF MY SITTING THERE AND AS TO THE GREATER EXPEDIENCY OF MY TRAVELLING BY WAGGON THE STORY OF MY SUPPOSED APPETITE GETTING WIND AMONG THE OUTSIDE PASSENGERS THEY WERE MERRY UPON IT LIKEWISE AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WAS GOING TO BE PAID FOR AT SCHOOL AS TWO BROTHERS OR THREE AND WHETHER I WAS CONTRACTED FOR OR WENT UPON THE REGULAR TERMS WITH OTHER PLEASANT QUESTIONS BUT THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT I KNEW I SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO EAT ANYTHING WHEN AN OPPORTUNITY OFFERED AND THAT AFTER A RATHER LIGHT DINNER I SHOULD REMAIN HUNGRY ALL NIGHTFOR I HAD LEFT MY CAKES BEHIND AT THE HOTEL IN MY HURRY MY APPREHENSIONS WERE REALIZED WHEN WE STOPPED FOR SUPPER I COULDNT MUSTER COURAGE TO TAKE ANY THOUGH I SHOULD HAVE LIKED IT VERY MUCH BUT SAT BY THE FIRE AND SAID I DIDNT WANT ANYTHING THIS DID NOT SAVE ME FROM MORE JOKES EITHER FOR A HUSKYVOICED GENTLEMAN WITH A ROUGH FACE WHO HAD BEEN EATING OUT OF A SANDWICHBOX NEARLY ALL THE WAY EXCEPT WHEN HE HAD BEEN DRINKING OUT OF A BOTTLE SAID I WAS LIKE A BOACONSTRICTOR WHO TOOK ENOUGH AT ONE MEAL TO LAST HIM A LONG TIME AFTER WHICH HE ACTUALLY BROUGHT A RASH OUT UPON HIMSELF WITH BOILED BEEF WE HAD STARTED FROM YARMOUTH AT THREE OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND WE WERE DUE IN LONDON ABOUT EIGHT NEXT MORNING IT WAS MIDSUMMER WEATHER AND THE EVENING WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN WE PASSED THROUGH A VILLAGE I PICTURED TO MYSELF WHAT THE INSIDES OF THE HOUSES WERE LIKE AND WHAT THE INHABITANTS WERE ABOUT AND WHEN BOYS CAME RUNNING AFTER US AND GOT UP BEHIND AND SWUNG THERE FOR A LITTLE WAY I WONDERED WHETHER THEIR FATHERS WERE ALIVE AND WHETHER THEY WERE HAPPY AT HOME I HAD PLENTY TO THINK OF THEREFORE BESIDES MY MIND RUNNING CONTINUALLY ON THE KIND OF PLACE I WAS GOING TOWHICH WAS AN AWFUL SPECULATION SOMETIMES I REMEMBER I RESIGNED MYSELF TO THOUGHTS OF HOME AND PEGGOTTY AND TO ENDEAVOURING IN A CONFUSED BLIND WAY TO RECALL HOW I HAD FELT AND WHAT SORT OF BOY I USED TO BE BEFORE I BIT MR MURDSTONE WHICH I COULDNT SATISFY MYSELF ABOUT BY ANY MEANS I SEEMED TO HAVE BITTEN HIM IN SUCH A REMOTE ANTIQUITY THE NIGHT WAS NOT SO PLEASANT AS THE EVENING FOR IT GOT CHILLY AND BEING PUT BETWEEN TWO GENTLEMEN THE ROUGHFACED ONE AND ANOTHER TO PREVENT MY TUMBLING OFF THE COACH I WAS NEARLY SMOTHERED BY THEIR FALLING ASLEEP AND COMPLETELY BLOCKING ME UP THEY SQUEEZED ME SO HARD SOMETIMES THAT I COULD NOT HELP CRYING OUT OH IF YOU PLEASEWHICH THEY DIDNT LIKE AT ALL BECAUSE IT WOKE THEM OPPOSITE ME WAS AN ELDERLY LADY IN A GREAT FUR CLOAK WHO LOOKED IN THE DARK MORE LIKE A HAYSTACK THAN A LADY SHE WAS WRAPPED UP TO SUCH A DEGREE THIS LADY HAD A BASKET WITH HER AND SHE HADNT KNOWN WHAT TO DO WITH IT FOR A LONG TIME UNTIL SHE FOUND THAT ON ACCOUNT OF MY LEGS BEING SHORT IT COULD GO UNDERNEATH ME IT CRAMPED AND HURT ME SO THAT IT MADE ME PERFECTLY MISERABLE BUT IF I MOVED IN THE LEAST AND MADE A GLASS THAT WAS IN THE BASKET RATTLE AGAINST SOMETHING ELSE AS IT WAS SURE TO DO SHE GAVE ME THE CRUELLEST POKE WITH HER FOOT AND SAID COME DONT YOU FIDGET YOUR BONES ARE YOUNG ENOUGH IM SURE AT LAST THE SUN ROSE AND THEN MY COMPANIONS SEEMED TO SLEEP EASIER THE DIFFICULTIES UNDER WHICH THEY HAD LABOURED ALL NIGHT AND WHICH HAD FOUND UTTERANCE IN THE MOST TERRIFIC GASPS AND SNORTS ARE NOT TO BE CONCEIVED AS THE SUN GOT HIGHER THEIR SLEEP BECAME LIGHTER AND SO THEY GRADUALLY ONE BY ONE AWOKE I RECOLLECT BEING VERY MUCH SURPRISED BY THE FEINT EVERYBODY MADE THEN OF NOT HAVING BEEN TO SLEEP AT ALL AND BY THE UNCOMMON INDIGNATION WITH WHICH EVERYONE REPELLED THE CHARGE I LABOUR UNDER THE SAME KIND OF ASTONISHMENT TO THIS DAY HAVING INVARIABLY OBSERVED THAT OF ALL HUMAN WEAKNESSES THE ONE TO WHICH OUR COMMON NATURE IS THE LEAST DISPOSED TO CONFESS I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY IS THE WEAKNESS OF HAVING GONE TO SLEEP IN A COACH WHAT AN AMAZING PLACE LONDON WAS TO ME WHEN I SAW IT IN THE DISTANCE AND HOW I BELIEVED ALL THE ADVENTURES OF ALL MY FAVOURITE HEROES TO BE CONSTANTLY ENACTING AND REENACTING THERE AND HOW I VAGUELY MADE IT OUT IN MY OWN MIND TO BE FULLER OF WONDERS AND WICKEDNESS THAN ALL THE CITIES OF THE EARTH I NEED NOT STOP HERE TO RELATE WE APPROACHED IT BY DEGREES AND GOT IN DUE TIME TO THE INN IN THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT FOR WHICH WE WERE BOUND I FORGET WHETHER IT WAS THE BLUE BULL OR THE BLUE BOAR BUT I KNOW IT WAS THE BLUE SOMETHING AND THAT ITS LIKENESS WAS PAINTED UP ON THE BACK OF THE COACH THE GUARDS EYE LIGHTED ON ME AS HE WAS GETTING DOWN AND HE SAID AT THE BOOKINGOFFICE DOOR IS THERE ANYBODY HERE FOR A YOONGSTER BOOKED IN THE NAME OF MURDSTONE FROM BLOONDERSTONE SOOFFOLK TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR NOBODY ANSWERED TRY COPPERFIELD IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID I LOOKING HELPLESSLY DOWN IS THERE ANYBODY HERE FOR A YOONGSTER BOOKED IN THE NAME OF MURDSTONE FROM BLOONDERSTONE SOOFFOLK BUT OWNING TO THE NAME OF COPPERFIELD TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR SAID THE GUARD COME IS THERE ANYBODY NO THERE WAS NOBODY I LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AROUND BUT THE INQUIRY MADE NO IMPRESSION ON ANY OF THE BYSTANDERS IF I EXCEPT A MAN IN GAITERS WITH ONE EYE WHO SUGGESTED THAT THEY HAD BETTER PUT A BRASS COLLAR ROUND MY NECK AND TIE ME UP IN THE STABLE A LADDER WAS BROUGHT AND I GOT DOWN AFTER THE LADY WHO WAS LIKE A HAYSTACK NOT DARING TO STIR UNTIL HER BASKET WAS REMOVED THE COACH WAS CLEAR OF PASSENGERS BY THAT TIME THE LUGGAGE WAS VERY SOON CLEARED OUT THE HORSES HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT BEFORE THE LUGGAGE AND NOW THE COACH ITSELF WAS WHEELED AND BACKED OFF BY SOME HOSTLERS OUT OF THE WAY STILL NOBODY APPEARED TO CLAIM THE DUSTY YOUNGSTER FROM BLUNDERSTONE SUFFOLK MORE SOLITARY THAN ROBINSON CRUSOE WHO HAD NOBODY TO LOOK AT HIM AND SEE THAT HE WAS SOLITARY I WENT INTO THE BOOKINGOFFICE AND BY INVITATION OF THE CLERK ON DUTY PASSED BEHIND THE COUNTER AND SAT DOWN ON THE SCALE AT WHICH THEY WEIGHED THE LUGGAGE HERE AS I SAT LOOKING AT THE PARCELS PACKAGES AND BOOKS AND INHALING THE SMELL OF STABLES EVER SINCE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MORNING A PROCESSION OF MOST TREMENDOUS CONSIDERATIONS BEGAN TO MARCH THROUGH MY MIND SUPPOSING NOBODY SHOULD EVER FETCH ME HOW LONG WOULD THEY CONSENT TO KEEP ME THERE WOULD THEY KEEP ME LONG ENOUGH TO SPEND SEVEN SHILLINGS SHOULD I SLEEP AT NIGHT IN ONE OF THOSE WOODEN BINS WITH THE OTHER LUGGAGE AND WASH MYSELF AT THE PUMP IN THE YARD IN THE MORNING OR SHOULD I BE TURNED OUT EVERY NIGHT AND EXPECTED TO COME AGAIN TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR WHEN THE OFFICE OPENED NEXT DAY SUPPOSING THERE WAS NO MISTAKE IN THE CASE AND MR MURDSTONE HAD DEVISED THIS PLAN TO GET RID OF ME WHAT SHOULD I DO IF THEY ALLOWED ME TO REMAIN THERE UNTIL MY SEVEN SHILLINGS WERE SPENT I COULDNT HOPE TO REMAIN THERE WHEN I BEGAN TO STARVE THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE INCONVENIENT AND UNPLEASANT TO THE CUSTOMERS BESIDES ENTAILING ON THE BLUE WHATEVERITWAS THE RISK OF FUNERAL EXPENSES IF I STARTED OFF AT ONCE AND TRIED TO WALK BACK HOME HOW COULD I EVER FIND MY WAY HOW COULD I EVER HOPE TO WALK SO FAR HOW COULD I MAKE SURE OF ANYONE BUT PEGGOTTY EVEN IF I GOT BACK IF I FOUND OUT THE NEAREST PROPER AUTHORITIES AND OFFERED MYSELF TO GO FOR A SOLDIER OR A SAILOR I WAS SUCH A LITTLE FELLOW THAT IT WAS MOST LIKELY THEY WOULDNT TAKE ME IN THESE THOUGHTS AND A HUNDRED OTHER SUCH THOUGHTS TURNED ME BURNING HOT AND MADE ME GIDDY WITH APPREHENSION AND DISMAY I WAS IN THE HEIGHT OF MY FEVER WHEN A MAN ENTERED AND WHISPERED TO THE CLERK WHO PRESENTLY SLANTED ME OFF THE SCALE AND PUSHED ME OVER TO HIM AS IF I WERE WEIGHED BOUGHT DELIVERED AND PAID FOR AS I WENT OUT OF THE OFFICE HAND IN HAND WITH THIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE I STOLE A LOOK AT HIM HE WAS A GAUNT SALLOW YOUNG MAN WITH HOLLOW CHEEKS AND A CHIN ALMOST AS BLACK AS MR MURDSTONES BUT THERE THE LIKENESS ENDED FOR HIS WHISKERS WERE SHAVED OFF AND HIS HAIR INSTEAD OF BEING GLOSSY WAS RUSTY AND DRY HE WAS DRESSED IN A SUIT OF BLACK CLOTHES WHICH WERE RATHER RUSTY AND DRY TOO AND RATHER SHORT IN THE SLEEVES AND LEGS AND HE HAD A WHITE NECKKERCHIEF ON THAT WAS NOT OVERCLEAN I DID NOT AND DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THIS NECKKERCHIEF WAS ALL THE LINEN HE WORE BUT IT WAS ALL HE SHOWED OR GAVE ANY HINT OF YOURE THE NEW BOY HE SAID YES SIR I SAID I SUPPOSED I WAS I DIDNT KNOW IM ONE OF THE MASTERS AT SALEM HOUSE HE SAID I MADE HIM A BOW AND FELT VERY MUCH OVERAWED I WAS SO ASHAMED TO ALLUDE TO A COMMONPLACE THING LIKE MY BOX TO A SCHOLAR AND A MASTER AT SALEM HOUSE THAT WE HAD GONE SOME LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE YARD BEFORE I HAD THE HARDIHOOD TO MENTION IT WE TURNED BACK ON MY HUMBLY INSINUATING THAT IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO ME HEREAFTER AND HE TOLD THE CLERK THAT THE CARRIER HAD INSTRUCTIONS TO CALL FOR IT AT NOON IF YOU PLEASE SIR I SAID WHEN WE HAD ACCOMPLISHED ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE AS BEFORE IS IT FAR ITS DOWN BY BLACKHEATH HE SAID IS THAT FAR SIR I DIFFIDENTLY ASKED ITS A GOOD STEP HE SAID WE SHALL GO BY THE STAGECOACH ITS ABOUT SIX MILES I WAS SO FAINT AND TIRED THAT THE IDEA OF HOLDING OUT FOR SIX MILES MORE WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME I TOOK HEART TO TELL HIM THAT I HAD HAD NOTHING ALL NIGHT AND THAT IF HE WOULD ALLOW ME TO BUY SOMETHING TO EAT I SHOULD BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM HE APPEARED SURPRISED AT THISI SEE HIM STOP AND LOOK AT ME NOWAND AFTER CONSIDERING FOR A FEW MOMENTS SAID HE WANTED TO CALL ON AN OLD PERSON WHO LIVED NOT FAR OFF AND THAT THE BEST WAY WOULD BE FOR ME TO BUY SOME BREAD OR WHATEVER I LIKED BEST THAT WAS WHOLESOME AND MAKE MY BREAKFAST AT HER HOUSE WHERE WE COULD GET SOME MILK ACCORDINGLY WE LOOKED IN AT A BAKERS WINDOW AND AFTER I HAD MADE A SERIES OF PROPOSALS TO BUY EVERYTHING THAT WAS BILIOUS IN THE SHOP AND HE HAD REJECTED THEM ONE BY ONE WE DECIDED IN FAVOUR OF A NICE LITTLE LOAF OF BROWN BREAD WHICH COST ME THREEPENCE THEN AT A GROCERS SHOP WE BOUGHT AN EGG AND A SLICE OF STREAKY BACON WHICH STILL LEFT WHAT I THOUGHT A GOOD DEAL OF CHANGE OUT OF THE SECOND OF THE BRIGHT SHILLINGS AND MADE ME CONSIDER LONDON A VERY CHEAP PLACE THESE PROVISIONS LAID IN WE WENT ON THROUGH A GREAT NOISE AND UPROAR THAT CONFUSED MY WEARY HEAD BEYOND DESCRIPTION AND OVER A BRIDGE WHICH NO DOUBT WAS LONDON BRIDGE INDEED I THINK HE TOLD ME SO BUT I WAS HALF ASLEEP UNTIL WE CAME TO THE POOR PERSONS HOUSE WHICH WAS A PART OF SOME ALMSHOUSES AS I KNEW BY THEIR LOOK AND BY AN INSCRIPTION ON A STONE OVER THE GATE WHICH SAID THEY WERE ESTABLISHED FOR TWENTYFIVE POOR WOMEN THE MASTER AT SALEM HOUSE LIFTED THE LATCH OF ONE OF A NUMBER OF LITTLE BLACK DOORS THAT WERE ALL ALIKE AND HAD EACH A LITTLE DIAMONDPANED WINDOW ON ONE SIDE AND ANOTHER LITTLE DIAMONDPANED WINDOW ABOVE AND WE WENT INTO THE LITTLE HOUSE OF ONE OF THESE POOR OLD WOMEN WHO WAS BLOWING A FIRE TO MAKE A LITTLE SAUCEPAN BOIL ON SEEING THE MASTER ENTER THE OLD WOMAN STOPPED WITH THE BELLOWS ON HER KNEE AND SAID SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT SOUNDED LIKE MY CHARLEY BUT ON SEEING ME COME IN TOO SHE GOT UP AND RUBBING HER HANDS MADE A CONFUSED SORT OF HALF CURTSEY CAN YOU COOK THIS YOUNG GENTLEMANS BREAKFAST FOR HIM IF YOU PLEASE SAID THE MASTER AT SALEM HOUSE CAN I SAID THE OLD WOMAN YES CAN I SURE HOWS MRS FIBBITSON TODAY SAID THE MASTER LOOKING AT ANOTHER OLD WOMAN IN A LARGE CHAIR BY THE FIRE WHO WAS SUCH A BUNDLE OF CLOTHES THAT I FEEL GRATEFUL TO THIS HOUR FOR NOT HAVING SAT UPON HER BY MISTAKE AH SHES POORLY SAID THE FIRST OLD WOMAN ITS ONE OF HER BAD DAYS IF THE FIRE WAS TO GO OUT THROUGH ANY ACCIDENT I VERILY BELIEVE SHED GO OUT TOO AND NEVER COME TO LIFE AGAIN AS THEY LOOKED AT HER I LOOKED AT HER ALSO ALTHOUGH IT WAS A WARM DAY SHE SEEMED TO THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE FIRE I FANCIED SHE WAS JEALOUS EVEN OF THE SAUCEPAN ON IT AND I HAVE REASON TO KNOW THAT SHE TOOK ITS IMPRESSMENT INTO THE SERVICE OF BOILING MY EGG AND BROILING MY BACON IN DUDGEON FOR I SAW HER WITH MY OWN DISCOMFITED EYES SHAKE HER FIST AT ME ONCE WHEN THOSE CULINARY OPERATIONS WERE GOING ON AND NO ONE ELSE WAS LOOKING THE SUN STREAMED IN AT THE LITTLE WINDOW BUT SHE SAT WITH HER OWN BACK AND THE BACK OF THE LARGE CHAIR TOWARDS IT SCREENING THE FIRE AS IF SHE WERE SEDULOUSLY KEEPING IT WARM INSTEAD OF IT KEEPING HER WARM AND WATCHING IT IN A MOST DISTRUSTFUL MANNER THE COMPLETION OF THE PREPARATIONS FOR MY BREAKFAST BY RELIEVING THE FIRE GAVE HER SUCH EXTREME JOY THAT SHE LAUGHED ALOUDAND A VERY UNMELODIOUS LAUGH SHE HAD I MUST SAY I SAT DOWN TO MY BROWN LOAF MY EGG AND MY RASHER OF BACON WITH A BASIN OF MILK BESIDES AND MADE A MOST DELICIOUS MEAL WHILE I WAS YET IN THE FULL ENJOYMENT OF IT THE OLD WOMAN OF THE HOUSE SAID TO THE MASTER HAVE YOU GOT YOUR FLUTE WITH YOU YES HE RETURNED HAVE A BLOW AT IT SAID THE OLD WOMAN COAXINGLY DO THE MASTER UPON THIS PUT HIS HAND UNDERNEATH THE SKIRTS OF HIS COAT AND BROUGHT OUT HIS FLUTE IN THREE PIECES WHICH HE SCREWED TOGETHER AND BEGAN IMMEDIATELY TO PLAY MY IMPRESSION IS AFTER MANY YEARS OF CONSIDERATION THAT THERE NEVER CAN HAVE BEEN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD WHO PLAYED WORSE HE MADE THE MOST DISMAL SOUNDS I HAVE EVER HEARD PRODUCED BY ANY MEANS NATURAL OR ARTIFICIAL I DONT KNOW WHAT THE TUNES WEREIF THERE WERE SUCH THINGS IN THE PERFORMANCE AT ALL WHICH I DOUBTBUT THE INFLUENCE OF THE STRAIN UPON ME WAS FIRST TO MAKE ME THINK OF ALL MY SORROWS UNTIL I COULD HARDLY KEEP MY TEARS BACK THEN TO TAKE AWAY MY APPETITE AND LASTLY TO MAKE ME SO SLEEPY THAT I COULDNT KEEP MY EYES OPEN THEY BEGIN TO CLOSE AGAIN AND I BEGIN TO NOD AS THE RECOLLECTION RISES FRESH UPON ME ONCE MORE THE LITTLE ROOM WITH ITS OPEN CORNER CUPBOARD AND ITS SQUAREBACKED CHAIRS AND ITS ANGULAR LITTLE STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE ROOM ABOVE AND ITS THREE PEACOCKS FEATHERS DISPLAYED OVER THE MANTELPIECEI REMEMBER WONDERING WHEN I FIRST WENT IN WHAT THAT PEACOCK WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IF HE HAD KNOWN WHAT HIS FINERY WAS DOOMED TO COME TOFADES FROM BEFORE ME AND I NOD AND SLEEP THE FLUTE BECOMES INAUDIBLE THE WHEELS OF THE COACH ARE HEARD INSTEAD AND I AM ON MY JOURNEY THE COACH JOLTS I WAKE WITH A START AND THE FLUTE HAS COME BACK AGAIN AND THE MASTER AT SALEM HOUSE IS SITTING WITH HIS LEGS CROSSED PLAYING IT DOLEFULLY WHILE THE OLD WOMAN OF THE HOUSE LOOKS ON DELIGHTED SHE FADES IN HER TURN AND HE FADES AND ALL FADES AND THERE IS NO FLUTE NO MASTER NO SALEM HOUSE NO DAVID COPPERFIELD NO ANYTHING BUT HEAVY SLEEP I DREAMED I THOUGHT THAT ONCE WHILE HE WAS BLOWING INTO THIS DISMAL FLUTE THE OLD WOMAN OF THE HOUSE WHO HAD GONE NEARER AND NEARER TO HIM IN HER ECSTATIC ADMIRATION LEANED OVER THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR AND GAVE HIM AN AFFECTIONATE SQUEEZE ROUND THE NECK WHICH STOPPED HIS PLAYING FOR A MOMENT I WAS IN THE MIDDLE STATE BETWEEN SLEEPING AND WAKING EITHER THEN OR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS FOR AS HE RESUMEDIT WAS A REAL FACT THAT HE HAD STOPPED PLAYINGI SAW AND HEARD THE SAME OLD WOMAN ASK MRS FIBBITSON IF IT WASNT DELICIOUS MEANING THE FLUTE TO WHICH MRS FIBBITSON REPLIED AY AY YES AND NODDED AT THE FIRE TO WHICH I AM PERSUADED SHE GAVE THE CREDIT OF THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE WHEN I SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DOZING A LONG WHILE THE MASTER AT SALEM HOUSE UNSCREWED HIS FLUTE INTO THE THREE PIECES PUT THEM UP AS BEFORE AND TOOK ME AWAY WE FOUND THE COACH VERY NEAR AT HAND AND GOT UPON THE ROOF BUT I WAS SO DEAD SLEEPY THAT WHEN WE STOPPED ON THE ROAD TO TAKE UP SOMEBODY ELSE THEY PUT ME INSIDE WHERE THERE WERE NO PASSENGERS AND WHERE I SLEPT PROFOUNDLY UNTIL I FOUND THE COACH GOING AT A FOOTPACE UP A STEEP HILL AMONG GREEN LEAVES PRESENTLY IT STOPPED AND HAD COME TO ITS DESTINATION A SHORT WALK BROUGHT USI MEAN THE MASTER AND METO SALEM HOUSE WHICH WAS ENCLOSED WITH A HIGH BRICK WALL AND LOOKED VERY DULL OVER A DOOR IN THIS WALL WAS A BOARD WITH SALEM HOUSE UPON IT AND THROUGH A GRATING IN THIS DOOR WE WERE SURVEYED WHEN WE RANG THE BELL BY A SURLY FACE WHICH I FOUND ON THE DOOR BEING OPENED BELONGED TO A STOUT MAN WITH A BULLNECK A WOODEN LEG OVERHANGING TEMPLES AND HIS HAIR CUT CLOSE ALL ROUND HIS HEAD THE NEW BOY SAID THE MASTER THE MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG EYED ME ALL OVERIT DIDNT TAKE LONG FOR THERE WAS NOT MUCH OF MEAND LOCKED THE GATE BEHIND US AND TOOK OUT THE KEY WE WERE GOING UP TO THE HOUSE AMONG SOME DARK HEAVY TREES WHEN HE CALLED AFTER MY CONDUCTOR HALLO WE LOOKED BACK AND HE WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR OF A LITTLE LODGE WHERE HE LIVED WITH A PAIR OF BOOTS IN HIS HAND HERE THE COBBLERS BEEN HE SAID SINCE YOUVE BEEN OUT MR MELL AND HE SAYS HE CANT MEND EM ANY MORE HE SAYS THERE AINT A BIT OF THE ORIGINAL BOOT LEFT AND HE WONDERS YOU EXPECT IT WITH THESE WORDS HE THREW THE BOOTS TOWARDS MR MELL WHO WENT BACK A FEW PACES TO PICK THEM UP AND LOOKED AT THEM VERY DISCONSOLATELY I WAS AFRAID AS WE WENT ON TOGETHER I OBSERVED THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE BOOTS HE HAD ON WERE A GOOD DEAL THE WORSE FOR WEAR AND THAT HIS STOCKING WAS JUST BREAKING OUT IN ONE PLACE LIKE A BUD SALEM HOUSE WAS A SQUARE BRICK BUILDING WITH WINGS OF A BARE AND UNFURNISHED APPEARANCE ALL ABOUT IT WAS SO VERY QUIET THAT I SAID TO MR MELL I SUPPOSED THE BOYS WERE OUT BUT HE SEEMED SURPRISED AT MY NOT KNOWING THAT IT WAS HOLIDAYTIME THAT ALL THE BOYS WERE AT THEIR SEVERAL HOMES THAT MR CREAKLE THE PROPRIETOR WAS DOWN BY THE SEASIDE WITH MRS AND MISS CREAKLE AND THAT I WAS SENT IN HOLIDAYTIME AS A PUNISHMENT FOR MY MISDOING ALL OF WHICH HE EXPLAINED TO ME AS WE WENT ALONG I GAZED UPON THE SCHOOLROOM INTO WHICH HE TOOK ME AS THE MOST FORLORN AND DESOLATE PLACE I HAD EVER SEEN I SEE IT NOW A LONG ROOM WITH THREE LONG ROWS OF DESKS AND SIX OF FORMS AND BRISTLING ALL ROUND WITH PEGS FOR HATS AND SLATES SCRAPS OF OLD COPYBOOKS AND EXERCISES LITTER THE DIRTY FLOOR SOME SILKWORMS HOUSES MADE OF THE SAME MATERIALS ARE SCATTERED OVER THE DESKS TWO MISERABLE LITTLE WHITE MICE LEFT BEHIND BY THEIR OWNER ARE RUNNING UP AND DOWN IN A FUSTY CASTLE MADE OF PASTEBOARD AND WIRE LOOKING IN ALL THE CORNERS WITH THEIR RED EYES FOR ANYTHING TO EAT A BIRD IN A CAGE VERY LITTLE BIGGER THAN HIMSELF MAKES A MOURNFUL RATTLE NOW AND THEN IN HOPPING ON HIS PERCH TWO INCHES HIGH OR DROPPING FROM IT BUT NEITHER SINGS NOR CHIRPS THERE IS A STRANGE UNWHOLESOME SMELL UPON THE ROOM LIKE MILDEWED CORDUROYS SWEET APPLES WANTING AIR AND ROTTEN BOOKS THERE COULD NOT WELL BE MORE INK SPLASHED ABOUT IT IF IT HAD BEEN ROOFLESS FROM ITS FIRST CONSTRUCTION AND THE SKIES HAD RAINED SNOWED HAILED AND BLOWN INK THROUGH THE VARYING SEASONS OF THE YEAR MR MELL HAVING LEFT ME WHILE HE TOOK HIS IRREPARABLE BOOTS UPSTAIRS I WENT SOFTLY TO THE UPPER END OF THE ROOM OBSERVING ALL THIS AS I CREPT ALONG SUDDENLY I CAME UPON A PASTEBOARD PLACARD BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN WHICH WAS LYING ON THE DESK AND BORE THESE WORDS TAKE CARE OF HIM HE BITES I GOT UPON THE DESK IMMEDIATELY APPREHENSIVE OF AT LEAST A GREAT DOG UNDERNEATH BUT THOUGH I LOOKED ALL ROUND WITH ANXIOUS EYES I COULD SEE NOTHING OF HIM I WAS STILL ENGAGED IN PEERING ABOUT WHEN MR MELL CAME BACK AND ASKED ME WHAT I DID UP THERE I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAYS I IF YOU PLEASE IM LOOKING FOR THE DOG DOG HE SAYS WHAT DOG ISNT IT A DOG SIR ISNT WHAT A DOG THATS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF SIR THAT BITES NO COPPERFIELD SAYS HE GRAVELY THATS NOT A DOG THATS A BOY MY INSTRUCTIONS ARE COPPERFIELD TO PUT THIS PLACARD ON YOUR BACK I AM SORRY TO MAKE SUCH A BEGINNING WITH YOU BUT I MUST DO IT WITH THAT HE TOOK ME DOWN AND TIED THE PLACARD WHICH WAS NEATLY CONSTRUCTED FOR THE PURPOSE ON MY SHOULDERS LIKE A KNAPSACK AND WHEREVER I WENT AFTERWARDS I HAD THE CONSOLATION OF CARRYING IT WHAT I SUFFERED FROM THAT PLACARD NOBODY CAN IMAGINE WHETHER IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO SEE ME OR NOT I ALWAYS FANCIED THAT SOMEBODY WAS READING IT IT WAS NO RELIEF TO TURN ROUND AND FIND NOBODY FOR WHEREVER MY BACK WAS THERE I IMAGINED SOMEBODY ALWAYS TO BE THAT CRUEL MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG AGGRAVATED MY SUFFERINGS HE WAS IN AUTHORITY AND IF HE EVER SAW ME LEANING AGAINST A TREE OR A WALL OR THE HOUSE HE ROARED OUT FROM HIS LODGE DOOR IN A STUPENDOUS VOICE HALLO YOU SIR YOU COPPERFIELD SHOW THAT BADGE CONSPICUOUS OR ILL REPORT YOU THE PLAYGROUND WAS A BARE GRAVELLED YARD OPEN TO ALL THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND THE OFFICES AND I KNEW THAT THE SERVANTS READ IT AND THE BUTCHER READ IT AND THE BAKER READ IT THAT EVERYBODY IN A WORD WHO CAME BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO THE HOUSE OF A MORNING WHEN I WAS ORDERED TO WALK THERE READ THAT I WAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF FOR I BIT I RECOLLECT THAT I POSITIVELY BEGAN TO HAVE A DREAD OF MYSELF AS A KIND OF WILD BOY WHO DID BITE THERE WAS AN OLD DOOR IN THIS PLAYGROUND ON WHICH THE BOYS HAD A CUSTOM OF CARVING THEIR NAMES IT WAS COMPLETELY COVERED WITH SUCH INSCRIPTIONS IN MY DREAD OF THE END OF THE VACATION AND THEIR COMING BACK I COULD NOT READ A BOYS NAME WITHOUT INQUIRING IN WHAT TONE AND WITH WHAT EMPHASIS HE WOULD READ TAKE CARE OF HIM HE BITES THERE WAS ONE BOYA CERTAIN J STEERFORTHWHO CUT HIS NAME VERY DEEP AND VERY OFTEN WHO I CONCEIVED WOULD READ IT IN A RATHER STRONG VOICE AND AFTERWARDS PULL MY HAIR THERE WAS ANOTHER BOY ONE TOMMY TRADDLES WHO I DREADED WOULD MAKE GAME OF IT AND PRETEND TO BE DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED OF ME THERE WAS A THIRD GEORGE DEMPLE WHO I FANCIED WOULD SING IT I HAVE LOOKED A LITTLE SHRINKING CREATURE AT THAT DOOR UNTIL THE OWNERS OF ALL THE NAMESTHERE WERE FIVEANDFORTY OF THEM IN THE SCHOOL THEN MR MELL SAIDSEEMED TO SEND ME TO COVENTRY BY GENERAL ACCLAMATION AND TO CRY OUT EACH IN HIS OWN WAY TAKE CARE OF HIM HE BITES IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE PLACES AT THE DESKS AND FORMS IT WAS THE SAME WITH THE GROVES OF DESERTED BEDSTEADS I PEEPED AT ON MY WAY TO AND WHEN I WAS IN MY OWN BED I REMEMBER DREAMING NIGHT AFTER NIGHT OF BEING WITH MY MOTHER AS SHE USED TO BE OR OF GOING TO A PARTY AT MR PEGGOTTYS OR OF TRAVELLING OUTSIDE THE STAGECOACH OR OF DINING AGAIN WITH MY UNFORTUNATE FRIEND THE WAITER AND IN ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAKING PEOPLE SCREAM AND STARE BY THE UNHAPPY DISCLOSURE THAT I HAD NOTHING ON BUT MY LITTLE NIGHTSHIRT AND THAT PLACARD IN THE MONOTONY OF MY LIFE AND IN MY CONSTANT APPREHENSION OF THE REOPENING OF THE SCHOOL IT WAS SUCH AN INSUPPORTABLE AFFLICTION I HAD LONG TASKS EVERY DAY TO DO WITH MR MELL BUT I DID THEM THERE BEING NO MR AND MISS MURDSTONE HERE AND GOT THROUGH THEM WITHOUT DISGRACE BEFORE AND AFTER THEM I WALKED ABOUTSUPERVISED AS I HAVE MENTIONED BY THE MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG HOW VIVIDLY I CALL TO MIND THE DAMP ABOUT THE HOUSE THE GREEN CRACKED FLAGSTONES IN THE COURT AN OLD LEAKY WATERBUTT AND THE DISCOLOURED TRUNKS OF SOME OF THE GRIM TREES WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE DRIPPED MORE IN THE RAIN THAN OTHER TREES AND TO HAVE BLOWN LESS IN THE SUN AT ONE WE DINED MR MELL AND I AT THE UPPER END OF A LONG BARE DININGROOM FULL OF DEAL TABLES AND SMELLING OF FAT THEN WE HAD MORE TASKS UNTIL TEA WHICH MR MELL DRANK OUT OF A BLUE TEACUP AND I OUT OF A TIN POT ALL DAY LONG AND UNTIL SEVEN OR EIGHT IN THE EVENING MR MELL AT HIS OWN DETACHED DESK IN THE SCHOOLROOM WORKED HARD WITH PEN INK RULER BOOKS AND WRITINGPAPER MAKING OUT THE BILLS AS I FOUND FOR LAST HALFYEAR WHEN HE HAD PUT UP HIS THINGS FOR THE NIGHT HE TOOK OUT HIS FLUTE AND BLEW AT IT UNTIL I ALMOST THOUGHT HE WOULD GRADUALLY BLOW HIS WHOLE BEING INTO THE LARGE HOLE AT THE TOP AND OOZE AWAY AT THE KEYS I PICTURE MY SMALL SELF IN THE DIMLYLIGHTED ROOMS SITTING WITH MY HEAD UPON MY HAND LISTENING TO THE DOLEFUL PERFORMANCE OF MR MELL AND CONNING TOMORROWS LESSONS I PICTURE MYSELF WITH MY BOOKS SHUT UP STILL LISTENING TO THE DOLEFUL PERFORMANCE OF MR MELL AND LISTENING THROUGH IT TO WHAT USED TO BE AT HOME AND TO THE BLOWING OF THE WIND ON YARMOUTH FLATS AND FEELING VERY SAD AND SOLITARY I PICTURE MYSELF GOING UP TO BED AMONG THE UNUSED ROOMS AND SITTING ON MY BEDSIDE CRYING FOR A COMFORTABLE WORD FROM PEGGOTTY I PICTURE MYSELF COMING DOWNSTAIRS IN THE MORNING AND LOOKING THROUGH A LONG GHASTLY GASH OF A STAIRCASE WINDOW AT THE SCHOOLBELL HANGING ON THE TOP OF AN OUTHOUSE WITH A WEATHERCOCK ABOVE IT AND DREADING THE TIME WHEN IT SHALL RING J STEERFORTH AND THE REST TO WORK WHICH IS ONLY SECOND IN MY FOREBODING APPREHENSIONS TO THE TIME WHEN THE MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG SHALL UNLOCK THE RUSTY GATE TO GIVE ADMISSION TO THE AWFUL MR CREAKLE I CANNOT THINK I WAS A VERY DANGEROUS CHARACTER IN ANY OF THESE ASPECTS BUT IN ALL OF THEM I CARRIED THE SAME WARNING ON MY BACK MR MELL NEVER SAID MUCH TO ME BUT HE WAS NEVER HARSH TO ME I SUPPOSE WE WERE COMPANY TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT TALKING I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT HE WOULD TALK TO HIMSELF SOMETIMES AND GRIN AND CLENCH HIS FIST AND GRIND HIS TEETH AND PULL HIS HAIR IN AN UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER BUT HE HAD THESE PECULIARITIES AND AT FIRST THEY FRIGHTENED ME THOUGH I SOON GOT USED TO THEM CHAPTER I ENLARGE MY CIRCLE OF ACQUAINTANCE I HAD LED THIS LIFE ABOUT A MONTH WHEN THE MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG BEGAN TO STUMP ABOUT WITH A MOP AND A BUCKET OF WATER FROM WHICH I INFERRED THAT PREPARATIONS WERE MAKING TO RECEIVE MR CREAKLE AND THE BOYS I WAS NOT MISTAKEN FOR THE MOP CAME INTO THE SCHOOLROOM BEFORE LONG AND TURNED OUT MR MELL AND ME WHO LIVED WHERE WE COULD AND GOT ON HOW WE COULD FOR SOME DAYS DURING WHICH WE WERE ALWAYS IN THE WAY OF TWO OR THREE YOUNG WOMEN WHO HAD RARELY SHOWN THEMSELVES BEFORE AND WERE SO CONTINUALLY IN THE MIDST OF DUST THAT I SNEEZED ALMOST AS MUCH AS IF SALEM HOUSE HAD BEEN A GREAT SNUFFBOX ONE DAY I WAS INFORMED BY MR MELL THAT MR CREAKLE WOULD BE HOME THAT EVENING IN THE EVENING AFTER TEA I HEARD THAT HE WAS COME BEFORE BEDTIME I WAS FETCHED BY THE MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG TO APPEAR BEFORE HIM MR CREAKLES PART OF THE HOUSE WAS A GOOD DEAL MORE COMFORTABLE THAN OURS AND HE HAD A SNUG BIT OF GARDEN THAT LOOKED PLEASANT AFTER THE DUSTY PLAYGROUND WHICH WAS SUCH A DESERT IN MINIATURE THAT I THOUGHT NO ONE BUT A CAMEL OR A DROMEDARY COULD HAVE FELT AT HOME IN IT IT SEEMED TO ME A BOLD THING EVEN TO TAKE NOTICE THAT THE PASSAGE LOOKED COMFORTABLE AS I WENT ON MY WAY TREMBLING TO MR CREAKLES PRESENCE WHICH SO ABASHED ME WHEN I WAS USHERED INTO IT THAT I HARDLY SAW MRS CREAKLE OR MISS CREAKLE WHO WERE BOTH THERE IN THE PARLOUR OR ANYTHING BUT MR CREAKLE A STOUT GENTLEMAN WITH A BUNCH OF WATCHCHAIN AND SEALS IN AN ARMCHAIR WITH A TUMBLER AND BOTTLE BESIDE HIM SO SAID MR CREAKLE THIS IS THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHOSE TEETH ARE TO BE FILED TURN HIM ROUND THE WOODENLEGGED MAN TURNED ME ABOUT SO AS TO EXHIBIT THE PLACARD AND HAVING AFFORDED TIME FOR A FULL SURVEY OF IT TURNED ME ABOUT AGAIN WITH MY FACE TO MR CREAKLE AND POSTED HIMSELF AT MR CREAKLES SIDE MR CREAKLES FACE WAS FIERY AND HIS EYES WERE SMALL AND DEEP IN HIS HEAD HE HAD THICK VEINS IN HIS FOREHEAD A LITTLE NOSE AND A LARGE CHIN HE WAS BALD ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HAD SOME THIN WETLOOKING HAIR THAT WAS JUST TURNING GREY BRUSHED ACROSS EACH TEMPLE SO THAT THE TWO SIDES INTERLACED ON HIS FOREHEAD BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE ABOUT HIM WHICH IMPRESSED ME MOST WAS THAT HE HAD NO VOICE BUT SPOKE IN A WHISPER THE EXERTION THIS COST HIM OR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF TALKING IN THAT FEEBLE WAY MADE HIS ANGRY FACE SO MUCH MORE ANGRY AND HIS THICK VEINS SO MUCH THICKER WHEN HE SPOKE THAT I AM NOT SURPRISED ON LOOKING BACK AT THIS PECULIARITY STRIKING ME AS HIS CHIEF ONE NOW SAID MR CREAKLE WHATS THE REPORT OF THIS BOY THERES NOTHING AGAINST HIM YET RETURNED THE MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG THERE HAS BEEN NO OPPORTUNITY I THOUGHT MR CREAKLE WAS DISAPPOINTED I THOUGHT MRS AND MISS CREAKLE AT WHOM I NOW GLANCED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WHO WERE BOTH THIN AND QUIET WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED COME HERE SIR SAID MR CREAKLE BECKONING TO ME COME HERE SAID THE MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG REPEATING THE GESTURE I HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF KNOWING YOUR FATHERINLAW WHISPERED MR CREAKLE TAKING ME BY THE EAR AND

NOT YET HEY REPEATED MR CREAKLE BUT YOU WILL SOON HEY YOU WILL SOON HEY REPEATED THE MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG I AFTERWARDS FOUND THAT HE GENERALLY ACTED WITH HIS STRONG VOICE AS MR CREAKLES INTERPRETER TO THE BOYS I WAS VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED AND SAID I HOPED SO IF HE PLEASED I FELT ALL THIS WHILE AS IF MY EAR WERE BLAZING HE PINCHED IT SO HARD ILL TELL YOU WHAT I AM WHISPERED MR CREAKLE LETTING IT GO AT LAST WITH A SCREW AT PARTING THAT BROUGHT THE WATER INTO MY EYES IM A TARTAR A TARTAR SAID THE MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG WHEN I SAY ILL DO A THING I DO IT SAID MR CREAKLE AND WHEN I SAY I WILL HAVE A

TO KNOW ME TOO MY YOUNG FRIEND AND YOU MAY GO TAKE HIM AWAY I WAS VERY GLAD TO BE ORDERED AWAY FOR MRS AND MISS CREAKLE WERE BOTH WIPING THEIR EYES AND I FELT AS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THEM AS I DID FOR MYSELF BUT I HAD A PETITION ON MY MIND WHICH CONCERNED ME SO NEARLY THAT I COULDNT HELP SAYING THOUGH I WONDERED AT MY OWN COURAGE IF YOU PLEASE SIR MR CREAKLE WHISPERED HAH WHATS THIS AND BENT HIS EYES UPON ME AS IF HE WOULD HAVE BURNT ME UP WITH THEM IF YOU PLEASE SIR I FALTERED IF I MIGHT BE ALLOWED I AM VERY SORRY INDEED SIR FOR WHAT I DID TO TAKE THIS WRITING OFF BEFORE THE BOYS COME BACK WHETHER MR CREAKLE WAS IN EARNEST OR WHETHER HE ONLY DID IT TO FRIGHTEN ME I DONT KNOW BUT HE MADE A BURST OUT OF HIS CHAIR BEFORE WHICH I PRECIPITATELY RETREATED WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE ESCORT OF THE MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG AND NEVER ONCE STOPPED UNTIL I REACHED MY OWN BEDROOM WHERE FINDING I WAS NOT PURSUED I WENT TO BED AS IT WAS TIME AND LAY QUAKING FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS NEXT MORNING MR SHARP CAME BACK MR SHARP WAS THE FIRST MASTER AND SUPERIOR TO MR MELL MR MELL TOOK HIS MEALS WITH THE BOYS BUT MR SHARP DINED AND SUPPED AT MR CREAKLES TABLE HE WAS A LIMP DELICATELOOKING GENTLEMAN I THOUGHT WITH A GOOD DEAL OF NOSE AND A WAY OF CARRYING HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AS IF IT WERE A LITTLE TOO HEAVY FOR HIM HIS HAIR WAS VERY SMOOTH AND WAVY BUT I WAS INFORMED BY THE VERY FIRST BOY WHO CAME BACK THAT IT WAS A WIG A SECONDHAND ONE HE SAID AND THAT MR SHARP WENT OUT EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO GET IT CURLED IT WAS NO OTHER THAN TOMMY TRADDLES WHO GAVE ME THIS PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE HE WAS THE FIRST BOY WHO RETURNED HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF BY INFORMING ME THAT I SHOULD FIND HIS NAME ON THE RIGHTHAND CORNER OF THE GATE OVER THE TOPBOLT UPON THAT I SAID TRADDLES TO WHICH HE REPLIED THE SAME AND THEN HE ASKED ME FOR A FULL ACCOUNT OF MYSELF AND FAMILY IT WAS A HAPPY CIRCUMSTANCE FOR ME THAT TRADDLES CAME BACK FIRST HE ENJOYED MY PLACARD SO MUCH THAT HE SAVED ME FROM THE EMBARRASSMENT OF EITHER DISCLOSURE OR CONCEALMENT BY PRESENTING ME TO EVERY OTHER BOY WHO CAME BACK GREAT OR SMALL IMMEDIATELY ON HIS ARRIVAL IN THIS FORM OF INTRODUCTION LOOK HERE HERES A GAME HAPPILY TOO THE GREATER PART OF THE BOYS CAME BACK LOWSPIRITED AND WERE NOT SO BOISTEROUS AT MY EXPENSE AS I HAD EXPECTED SOME OF THEM CERTAINLY DID DANCE ABOUT ME LIKE WILD INDIANS AND THE GREATER PART COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF PRETENDING THAT I WAS A DOG AND PATTING AND SOOTHING ME LEST I SHOULD BITE AND SAYING LIE DOWN SIR AND CALLING ME TOWZER THIS WAS NATURALLY CONFUSING AMONG SO MANY STRANGERS AND COST ME SOME TEARS BUT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS MUCH BETTER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED I WAS NOT CONSIDERED AS BEING FORMALLY RECEIVED INTO THE SCHOOL HOWEVER UNTIL J STEERFORTH ARRIVED BEFORE THIS BOY WHO WAS REPUTED TO BE A GREAT SCHOLAR AND WAS VERY GOODLOOKING AND AT LEAST HALFADOZEN YEARS MY SENIOR I WAS CARRIED AS BEFORE A MAGISTRATE HE INQUIRED UNDER A SHED IN THE PLAYGROUND INTO THE PARTICULARS OF MY

FEAST AT MY TIME OF LIFE WHILE HE WAS BY MY HAND SHOOK AT THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT I BEGGED HIM TO DO ME THE FAVOUR OF PRESIDING AND MY REQUEST BEING SECONDED BY THE OTHER BOYS WHO WERE IN THAT ROOM HE ACCEDED TO IT AND SAT UPON MY PILLOW HANDING ROUND THE VIANDSWITH PERFECT FAIRNESS I MUST SAYAND DISPENSING THE CURRANT WINE IN A LITTLE GLASS WITHOUT A FOOT WHICH WAS HIS OWN PROPERTY AS TO ME I SAT ON HIS LEFT HAND AND THE REST WERE GROUPED ABOUT US ON THE NEAREST BEDS AND ON THE FLOOR HOW WELL I RECOLLECT OUR SITTING THERE TALKING IN WHISPERS OR THEIR TALKING AND MY RESPECTFULLY LISTENING I OUGHT RATHER TO SAY THE MOONLIGHT FALLING A LITTLE WAY INTO THE ROOM THROUGH THE WINDOW PAINTING A PALE WINDOW ON THE FLOOR AND THE GREATER PART OF US IN SHADOW EXCEPT WHEN STEERFORTH DIPPED A MATCH INTO A PHOSPHORUSBOX WHEN HE WANTED TO LOOK FOR ANYTHING ON THE BOARD AND SHED A BLUE GLARE OVER US THAT WAS GONE DIRECTLY A CERTAIN MYSTERIOUS FEELING CONSEQUENT ON THE DARKNESS THE SECRECY OF THE REVEL AND THE WHISPER IN WHICH EVERYTHING WAS SAID STEALS OVER ME AGAIN AND I LISTEN TO ALL THEY TELL ME WITH A VAGUE FEELING OF SOLEMNITY AND AWE WHICH MAKES ME GLAD THAT THEY ARE ALL SO NEAR AND FRIGHTENS ME THOUGH I FEIGN TO LAUGH WHEN TRADDLES PRETENDS TO SEE A GHOST IN THE CORNER I HEARD ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT THE SCHOOL AND ALL BELONGING TO IT I HEARD THAT MR CREAKLE HAD NOT PREFERRED HIS CLAIM TO BEING A TARTAR WITHOUT REASON THAT HE WAS THE STERNEST AND MOST SEVERE OF MASTERS THAT HE LAID ABOUT HIM RIGHT AND LEFT EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE CHARGING IN AMONG THE BOYS LIKE A TROOPER AND SLASHING AWAY UNMERCIFULLY THAT HE KNEW NOTHING HIMSELF BUT THE ART OF SLASHING BEING MORE IGNORANT J STEERFORTH SAID THAN THE LOWEST BOY IN THE SCHOOL THAT HE HAD BEEN A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO A SMALL HOPDEALER IN THE BOROUGH AND HAD TAKEN TO THE SCHOOLING BUSINESS AFTER BEING BANKRUPT IN HOPS AND MAKING AWAY WITH MRS CREAKLES MONEY WITH A GOOD DEAL MORE OF THAT SORT WHICH I WONDERED HOW THEY KNEW I HEARD THAT THE MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG WHOSE NAME WAS TUNGAY WAS AN OBSTINATE BARBARIAN WHO HAD FORMERLY ASSISTED IN THE HOP BUSINESS BUT HAD COME INTO THE SCHOLASTIC LINE WITH MR CREAKLE IN CONSEQUENCE AS WAS SUPPOSED AMONG THE BOYS OF HIS HAVING BROKEN HIS LEG IN MR CREAKLES SERVICE AND HAVING DONE A DEAL OF DISHONEST WORK FOR HIM AND KNOWING HIS SECRETS I HEARD THAT WITH THE SINGLE EXCEPTION OF MR CREAKLE TUNGAY CONSIDERED THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT MASTERS AND BOYS AS HIS NATURAL ENEMIES AND THAT THE ONLY DELIGHT OF HIS LIFE WAS TO BE SOUR AND MALICIOUS I HEARD THAT MR CREAKLE HAD A SON WHO HAD NOT BEEN TUNGAYS FRIEND AND WHO ASSISTING IN THE SCHOOL HAD ONCE HELD SOME REMONSTRANCE WITH HIS FATHER ON AN OCCASION WHEN ITS DISCIPLINE WAS VERY CRUELLY EXERCISED AND WAS SUPPOSED BESIDES TO HAVE PROTESTED AGAINST HIS FATHERS USAGE OF HIS MOTHER I HEARD THAT MR CREAKLE HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF DOORS IN CONSEQUENCE AND THAT MRS AND MISS CREAKLE HAD BEEN IN A SAD WAY EVER SINCE BUT THE GREATEST WONDER THAT I HEARD OF MR CREAKLE WAS THERE BEING ONE BOY IN THE SCHOOL ON WHOM HE NEVER VENTURED TO LAY A HAND AND THAT BOY BEING J STEERFORTH STEERFORTH HIMSELF CONFIRMED THIS WHEN IT WAS STATED AND SAID THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO BEGIN TO SEE HIM DO IT ON BEING ASKED BY A MILD BOY NOT ME HOW HE WOULD PROCEED IF HE DID BEGIN TO SEE HIM DO IT HE DIPPED A MATCH INTO HIS PHOSPHORUSBOX ON PURPOSE TO SHED A GLARE OVER HIS REPLY AND SAID HE WOULD COMMENCE BY KNOCKING HIM DOWN WITH A BLOW ON THE FOREHEAD FROM THE SEVENANDSIXPENNY INKBOTTLE THAT WAS ALWAYS ON THE MANTELPIECE WE SAT IN THE DARK FOR SOME TIME BREATHLESS I HEARD THAT MR SHARP AND MR MELL WERE BOTH SUPPOSED TO BE WRETCHEDLY PAID AND THAT WHEN THERE WAS HOT AND COLD MEAT FOR DINNER AT MR CREAKLES TABLE MR SHARP WAS ALWAYS EXPECTED TO SAY HE PREFERRED COLD WHICH WAS AGAIN CORROBORATED BY J STEERFORTH THE ONLY PARLOURBOARDER I HEARD THAT MR SHARPS WIG DIDNT FIT HIM AND THAT HE NEEDNT BE SO BOUNCEABLESOMEBODY ELSE SAID BUMPTIOUSABOUT IT BECAUSE HIS OWN RED HAIR WAS VERY PLAINLY TO BE SEEN BEHIND I HEARD THAT ONE BOY WHO WAS A COALMERCHANTS SON CAME AS A SETOFF AGAINST THE COALBILL AND WAS CALLED ON THAT ACCOUNT EXCHANGE OR BARTERA NAME SELECTED FROM THE ARITHMETIC BOOK AS EXPRESSING THIS ARRANGEMENT I HEARD THAT THE TABLE BEER WAS A ROBBERY OF PARENTS AND THE PUDDING AN IMPOSITION I HEARD THAT MISS CREAKLE WAS REGARDED BY THE SCHOOL IN GENERAL AS BEING IN LOVE WITH STEERFORTH AND I AM SURE AS I SAT IN THE DARK THINKING OF HIS NICE VOICE AND HIS FINE FACE AND HIS EASY MANNER AND HIS CURLING HAIR I THOUGHT IT VERY LIKELY I HEARD THAT MR MELL WAS NOT A BAD SORT OF FELLOW BUT HADNT A SIXPENCE TO BLESS HIMSELF WITH AND THAT THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT OLD MRS MELL HIS MOTHER WAS AS POOR AS JOB I THOUGHT OF MY BREAKFAST THEN AND WHAT HAD SOUNDED LIKE MY CHARLEY BUT I WAS I AM GLAD TO REMEMBER AS MUTE AS A MOUSE ABOUT IT THE HEARING OF ALL THIS AND A GOOD DEAL MORE OUTLASTED THE BANQUET SOME TIME THE GREATER PART OF THE GUESTS HAD GONE TO BED AS SOON AS THE EATING AND DRINKING WERE OVER AND WE WHO HAD REMAINED WHISPERING AND LISTENING HALFUNDRESSED AT LAST BETOOK OURSELVES TO BED TOO GOOD NIGHT YOUNG COPPERFIELD SAID STEERFORTH ILL TAKE CARE OF YOU YOURE VERY KIND I GRATEFULLY RETURNED I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU YOU HAVENT GOT A SISTER HAVE YOU SAID STEERFORTH YAWNING NO I ANSWERED THATS A PITY SAID STEERFORTH IF YOU HAD HAD ONE I SHOULD THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN A PRETTY TIMID LITTLE BRIGHTEYED SORT OF GIRL I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOW HER GOOD NIGHT YOUNG COPPERFIELD GOOD NIGHT SIR I REPLIED I THOUGHT OF HIM VERY MUCH AFTER I WENT TO BED AND RAISED MYSELF I RECOLLECT TO LOOK AT HIM WHERE HE LAY IN THE MOONLIGHT WITH HIS HANDSOME FACE TURNED UP AND HIS HEAD RECLINING EASILY ON HIS ARM HE WAS A PERSON OF GREAT POWER IN MY EYES THAT WAS OF COURSE THE REASON OF MY MIND RUNNING ON HIM NO VEILED FUTURE DIMLY GLANCED UPON HIM IN THE MOONBEAMS THERE WAS NO SHADOWY PICTURE OF HIS FOOTSTEPS IN THE GARDEN THAT I DREAMED OF WALKING IN ALL NIGHT CHAPTER MY FIRST HALF AT SALEM HOUSE SCHOOL BEGAN IN EARNEST NEXT DAY A PROFOUND IMPRESSION WAS MADE UPON ME I REMEMBER BY THE ROAR OF VOICES IN THE SCHOOLROOM SUDDENLY BECOMING HUSHED AS DEATH WHEN MR CREAKLE ENTERED AFTER BREAKFAST AND STOOD IN THE DOORWAY LOOKING ROUND UPON US LIKE A GIANT IN A STORYBOOK SURVEYING HIS CAPTIVES TUNGAY STOOD AT MR CREAKLES ELBOW HE HAD NO OCCASION I THOUGHT TO CRY OUT SILENCE SO FEROCIOUSLY FOR THE BOYS WERE ALL STRUCK SPEECHLESS AND MOTIONLESS MR CREAKLE WAS SEEN TO SPEAK AND TUNGAY WAS HEARD TO THIS EFFECT NOW BOYS THIS IS A NEW HALF TAKE CARE WHAT YOURE ABOUT IN THIS NEW HALF COME FRESH UP TO THE LESSONS I ADVISE YOU FOR I COME FRESH UP TO THE PUNISHMENT I WONT FLINCH IT WILL BE OF NO USE YOUR RUBBING YOURSELVES YOU WONT RUB THE MARKS OUT THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU NOW GET TO WORK EVERY BOY WHEN THIS DREADFUL EXORDIUM WAS OVER AND TUNGAY HAD STUMPED OUT AGAIN MR CREAKLE CAME TO WHERE I SAT AND TOLD ME THAT IF I WERE FAMOUS FOR BITING HE WAS FAMOUS FOR BITING TOO HE THEN SHOWED ME THE CANE AND ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT OF THAT FOR A TOOTH WAS IT A SHARP TOOTH HEY WAS IT A DOUBLE TOOTH HEY HAD IT A DEEP PRONG HEY DID IT BITE HEY DID IT BITE AT EVERY QUESTION HE GAVE ME A FLESHY CUT WITH IT THAT MADE ME WRITHE SO I WAS VERY SOON MADE FREE OF SALEM HOUSE AS STEERFORTH SAID AND WAS VERY SOON IN TEARS ALSO NOT THAT I MEAN TO SAY THESE WERE SPECIAL MARKS OF DISTINCTION WHICH ONLY I RECEIVED ON THE CONTRARY A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE BOYS ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER ONES WERE VISITED WITH SIMILAR INSTANCES OF NOTICE AS MR CREAKLE MADE THE ROUND OF THE SCHOOLROOM HALF THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS WRITHING AND CRYING BEFORE THE DAYS WORK BEGAN AND HOW MUCH OF IT HAD WRITHED AND CRIED BEFORE THE DAYS WORK WAS OVER I AM REALLY AFRAID TO RECOLLECT LEST I SHOULD SEEM TO EXAGGERATE I SHOULD THINK THERE NEVER CAN HAVE BEEN A MAN WHO ENJOYED HIS PROFESSION MORE THAN MR CREAKLE DID HE HAD A DELIGHT IN CUTTING AT THE BOYS WHICH WAS LIKE THE SATISFACTION OF A CRAVING APPETITE I AM CONFIDENT THAT HE COULDNT RESIST A CHUBBY BOY ESPECIALLY THAT THERE WAS A FASCINATION IN SUCH A SUBJECT WHICH MADE HIM RESTLESS IN HIS MIND UNTIL HE HAD SCORED AND MARKED HIM FOR THE DAY I WAS CHUBBY MYSELF AND OUGHT TO KNOW I AM SURE WHEN I THINK OF THE FELLOW NOW MY BLOOD RISES AGAINST HIM WITH THE DISINTERESTED INDIGNATION I SHOULD FEEL IF I COULD HAVE KNOWN ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT HAVING EVER BEEN IN HIS POWER BUT IT RISES HOTLY BECAUSE I KNOW HIM TO HAVE BEEN AN INCAPABLE BRUTE WHO HAD NO MORE RIGHT TO BE POSSESSED OF THE GREAT TRUST HE HELD THAN TO BE LORD HIGH ADMIRAL OR COMMANDERINCHIEFIN EITHER OF WHICH CAPACITIES IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE INFINITELY LESS MISCHIEF MISERABLE LITTLE PROPITIATORS OF A REMORSELESS IDOL HOW ABJECT WE WERE TO HIM WHAT A LAUNCH IN LIFE I THINK IT NOW ON LOOKING BACK TO BE SO MEAN AND SERVILE TO A MAN OF SUCH PARTS AND PRETENSIONS HERE I SIT AT THE DESK AGAIN WATCHING HIS EYEHUMBLY WATCHING HIS EYE AS HE RULES A CIPHERINGBOOK FOR ANOTHER VICTIM WHOSE HANDS HAVE JUST BEEN FLATTENED BY THAT IDENTICAL RULER AND WHO IS TRYING TO WIPE THE STING OUT WITH A POCKETHANDKERCHIEF I HAVE PLENTY TO DO I DONT WATCH HIS EYE IN IDLENESS BUT BECAUSE I AM MORBIDLY ATTRACTED TO IT IN A DREAD DESIRE TO KNOW WHAT HE WILL DO NEXT AND WHETHER IT WILL BE MY TURN TO SUFFER OR SOMEBODY ELSES A LANE OF SMALL BOYS BEYOND ME WITH THE SAME INTEREST IN HIS EYE WATCH IT TOO I THINK HE KNOWS IT THOUGH HE PRETENDS HE DONT HE MAKES DREADFUL MOUTHS AS HE RULES THE CIPHERINGBOOK AND NOW HE THROWS HIS EYE SIDEWAYS DOWN OUR LANE AND WE ALL DROOP OVER OUR BOOKS AND TREMBLE A MOMENT AFTERWARDS WE ARE AGAIN EYEING HIM AN UNHAPPY CULPRIT FOUND GUILTY OF IMPERFECT EXERCISE APPROACHES AT HIS COMMAND THE CULPRIT FALTERS EXCUSES AND PROFESSES A DETERMINATION TO DO BETTER TOMORROW MR CREAKLE CUTS A JOKE BEFORE HE BEATS HIM AND WE LAUGH AT ITMISERABLE LITTLE DOGS WE LAUGH WITH OUR VISAGES AS WHITE AS ASHES AND OUR HEARTS SINKING INTO OUR BOOTS HERE I SIT AT THE DESK AGAIN ON A DROWSY SUMMER AFTERNOON A BUZZ AND HUM GO UP AROUND ME AS IF THE BOYS WERE SO MANY BLUEBOTTLES A CLOGGY SENSATION OF THE LUKEWARM FAT OF MEAT IS UPON ME WE DINED AN HOUR OR TWO AGO AND MY HEAD IS AS HEAVY AS SO MUCH LEAD I WOULD GIVE THE WORLD TO GO TO SLEEP I SIT WITH MY EYE ON MR CREAKLE BLINKING AT HIM LIKE A YOUNG OWL WHEN SLEEP OVERPOWERS ME FOR A MINUTE HE STILL LOOMS THROUGH MY SLUMBER RULING THOSE CIPHERINGBOOKS UNTIL HE SOFTLY COMES BEHIND ME AND WAKES ME TO PLAINER PERCEPTION OF HIM WITH A RED RIDGE ACROSS MY BACK HERE I AM IN THE PLAYGROUND WITH MY EYE STILL FASCINATED BY HIM THOUGH I CANT SEE HIM THE WINDOW AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM WHICH I KNOW HE IS HAVING HIS DINNER STANDS FOR HIM AND I EYE THAT INSTEAD IF HE SHOWS HIS FACE NEAR IT MINE ASSUMES AN IMPLORING AND SUBMISSIVE EXPRESSION IF HE LOOKS OUT THROUGH THE GLASS THE BOLDEST BOY STEERFORTH EXCEPTED STOPS IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHOUT OR YELL AND BECOMES CONTEMPLATIVE ONE DAY TRADDLES THE MOST UNFORTUNATE BOY IN THE WORLD BREAKS THAT WINDOW ACCIDENTALLY WITH A BALL I SHUDDER AT THIS MOMENT WITH THE TREMENDOUS SENSATION OF SEEING IT DONE AND FEELING THAT THE BALL HAS BOUNDED ON TO MR CREAKLES SACRED HEAD POOR TRADDLES IN A TIGHT SKYBLUE SUIT THAT MADE HIS ARMS AND LEGS LIKE GERMAN SAUSAGES OR ROLYPOLY PUDDINGS HE WAS THE MERRIEST AND MOST MISERABLE OF ALL THE BOYS HE WAS ALWAYS BEING CANEDI THINK HE WAS CANED EVERY DAY THAT HALFYEAR EXCEPT ONE HOLIDAY MONDAY WHEN HE WAS ONLY RULERD ON BOTH HANDSAND WAS ALWAYS GOING TO WRITE TO HIS UNCLE ABOUT IT AND NEVER DID AFTER LAYING HIS HEAD ON THE DESK FOR A LITTLE WHILE HE WOULD CHEER UP SOMEHOW BEGIN TO LAUGH AGAIN AND DRAW SKELETONS ALL OVER HIS SLATE BEFORE HIS EYES WERE DRY I USED AT FIRST TO WONDER WHAT COMFORT TRADDLES FOUND IN DRAWING SKELETONS AND FOR SOME TIME LOOKED UPON HIM AS A SORT OF HERMIT WHO REMINDED HIMSELF BY THOSE SYMBOLS OF MORTALITY THAT CANING COULDNT LAST FOR EVER BUT I BELIEVE HE ONLY DID IT BECAUSE THEY WERE EASY AND DIDNT WANT ANY FEATURES HE WAS VERY HONOURABLE TRADDLES WAS AND HELD IT AS A SOLEMN DUTY IN THE BOYS TO STAND BY ONE ANOTHER HE SUFFERED FOR THIS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND PARTICULARLY ONCE WHEN STEERFORTH LAUGHED IN CHURCH AND THE BEADLE THOUGHT IT WAS TRADDLES AND TOOK HIM OUT I SEE HIM NOW GOING AWAY IN CUSTODY DESPISED BY THE CONGREGATION HE NEVER SAID WHO WAS THE REAL OFFENDER THOUGH HE SMARTED FOR IT NEXT DAY AND WAS IMPRISONED SO MANY HOURS THAT HE CAME FORTH WITH A WHOLE CHURCHYARDFULL OF SKELETONS SWARMING ALL OVER HIS LATIN DICTIONARY BUT HE HAD HIS REWARD STEERFORTH SAID THERE WAS NOTHING OF THE SNEAK IN TRADDLES AND WE ALL FELT THAT TO BE THE HIGHEST PRAISE FOR MY PART I COULD HAVE GONE THROUGH A GOOD DEAL THOUGH I WAS MUCH LESS BRAVE THAN TRADDLES AND NOTHING LIKE SO OLD TO HAVE WON SUCH A RECOMPENSE TO SEE STEERFORTH WALK TO CHURCH BEFORE US ARMINARM WITH MISS CREAKLE WAS ONE OF THE GREAT SIGHTS OF MY LIFE I DIDNT THINK MISS CREAKLE EQUAL TO LITTLE EMLY IN POINT OF BEAUTY AND I DIDNT LOVE HER I DIDNT DARE BUT I THOUGHT HER A YOUNG LADY OF EXTRAORDINARY ATTRACTIONS AND IN POINT OF GENTILITY NOT TO BE SURPASSED WHEN STEERFORTH IN WHITE TROUSERS CARRIED HER PARASOL FOR HER I FELT PROUD TO KNOW HIM AND BELIEVED THAT SHE COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT ADORE HIM WITH ALL HER HEART MR SHARP AND MR MELL WERE BOTH NOTABLE PERSONAGES IN MY EYES BUT STEERFORTH WAS TO THEM WHAT THE SUN WAS TO TWO STARS STEERFORTH CONTINUED HIS PROTECTION OF ME AND PROVED A VERY USEFUL FRIEND SINCE NOBODY DARED TO ANNOY ONE WHOM HE HONOURED WITH HIS COUNTENANCE HE COULDNTOR AT ALL EVENTS HE DIDNTDEFEND ME FROM MR CREAKLE WHO WAS VERY SEVERE WITH ME BUT WHENEVER I HAD BEEN TREATED WORSE THAN USUAL HE ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT I WANTED A LITTLE OF HIS PLUCK AND THAT HE WOULDNT HAVE STOOD IT HIMSELF WHICH I FELT HE INTENDED FOR ENCOURAGEMENT AND CONSIDERED TO BE VERY KIND OF HIM THERE WAS ONE ADVANTAGE AND ONLY ONE THAT I KNOW OF IN MR CREAKLES SEVERITY HE FOUND MY PLACARD IN HIS WAY WHEN HE CAME UP OR DOWN BEHIND THE FORM ON WHICH I SAT AND WANTED TO MAKE A CUT AT ME IN PASSING FOR THIS REASON IT WAS SOON TAKEN OFF AND I SAW IT NO MORE AN ACCIDENTAL CIRCUMSTANCE CEMENTED THE INTIMACY BETWEEN STEERFORTH AND ME IN A MANNER THAT INSPIRED ME WITH GREAT PRIDE AND SATISFACTION THOUGH IT SOMETIMES LED TO INCONVENIENCE IT HAPPENED ON ONE OCCASION WHEN HE WAS DOING ME THE HONOUR OF TALKING TO ME IN THE PLAYGROUND THAT I HAZARDED THE OBSERVATION THAT SOMETHING OR SOMEBODYI FORGET WHAT NOWWAS LIKE SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY IN PEREGRINE PICKLE HE SAID NOTHING AT THE TIME BUT WHEN I WAS GOING TO BED AT NIGHT ASKED ME IF I HAD GOT THAT BOOK I TOLD HIM NO AND EXPLAINED HOW IT WAS THAT I HAD READ IT AND ALL THOSE OTHER BOOKS OF WHICH I HAVE MADE MENTION AND DO YOU RECOLLECT THEM STEERFORTH SAID OH YES I REPLIED I HAD A GOOD MEMORY AND I BELIEVED I RECOLLECTED THEM VERY WELL THEN I TELL YOU WHAT YOUNG COPPERFIELD SAID STEERFORTH YOU SHALL TELL EM TO ME I CANT GET TO SLEEP VERY EARLY AT NIGHT AND I GENERALLY WAKE RATHER EARLY IN THE MORNING WELL GO OVER EM ONE AFTER ANOTHER WELL MAKE SOME REGULAR ARABIAN NIGHTS OF IT I FELT EXTREMELY FLATTERED BY THIS ARRANGEMENT AND WE COMMENCED CARRYING IT INTO EXECUTION THAT VERY EVENING WHAT RAVAGES I COMMITTED ON MY FAVOURITE AUTHORS IN THE COURSE OF MY INTERPRETATION OF THEM I AM NOT IN A CONDITION TO SAY AND SHOULD BE VERY UNWILLING TO KNOW BUT I HAD A PROFOUND FAITH IN THEM AND I HAD TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF A SIMPLE EARNEST MANNER OF NARRATING WHAT I DID NARRATE AND THESE QUALITIES WENT A LONG WAY THE DRAWBACK WAS THAT I WAS OFTEN SLEEPY AT NIGHT OR OUT OF SPIRITS AND INDISPOSED TO RESUME THE STORY AND THEN IT WAS RATHER HARD WORK AND IT MUST BE DONE FOR TO DISAPPOINT OR TO DISPLEASE STEERFORTH WAS OF COURSE OUT OF THE QUESTION IN THE MORNING TOO WHEN I FELT WEARY AND SHOULD HAVE ENJOYED ANOTHER HOURS REPOSE VERY MUCH IT WAS A TIRESOME THING TO BE ROUSED LIKE THE SULTANA SCHEHERAZADE AND FORCED INTO A LONG STORY BEFORE THE GETTINGUP BELL RANG BUT STEERFORTH WAS RESOLUTE AND AS HE EXPLAINED TO ME IN RETURN MY SUMS AND EXERCISES AND ANYTHING IN MY TASKS THAT WAS TOO HARD FOR ME I WAS NO LOSER BY THE TRANSACTION LET ME DO MYSELF JUSTICE HOWEVER I WAS MOVED BY NO INTERESTED OR SELFISH MOTIVE NOR WAS I MOVED BY FEAR OF HIM I ADMIRED AND LOVED HIM AND HIS APPROVAL WAS RETURN ENOUGH IT WAS SO PRECIOUS TO ME THAT I LOOK BACK ON THESE TRIFLES NOW WITH AN ACHING HEART STEERFORTH WAS CONSIDERATE TOO AND SHOWED HIS CONSIDERATION IN ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE IN AN UNFLINCHING MANNER THAT WAS A LITTLE TANTALIZING I SUSPECT TO POOR TRADDLES AND THE REST PEGGOTTYS PROMISED LETTERWHAT A COMFORTABLE LETTER IT WASARRIVED BEFORE THE HALF WAS MANY WEEKS OLD AND WITH IT A CAKE IN A PERFECT NEST OF ORANGES AND TWO BOTTLES OF COWSLIP WINE THIS TREASURE AS IN DUTY BOUND I LAID AT THE FEET OF STEERFORTH AND BEGGED HIM TO DISPENSE NOW ILL TELL YOU WHAT YOUNG COPPERFIELD SAID HE THE WINE SHALL BE KEPT TO WET YOUR WHISTLE WHEN YOU ARE STORYTELLING I BLUSHED AT THE IDEA AND BEGGED HIM IN MY MODESTY NOT TO THINK OF IT BUT HE SAID HE HAD OBSERVED I WAS SOMETIMES HOARSEA LITTLE ROOPY WAS HIS EXACT EXPRESSIONAND IT SHOULD BE EVERY DROP DEVOTED TO THE PURPOSE HE HAD MENTIONED ACCORDINGLY IT WAS LOCKED UP IN HIS BOX AND DRAWN OFF BY HIMSELF IN A PHIAL AND ADMINISTERED TO ME THROUGH A PIECE OF QUILL IN THE CORK WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN WANT OF A RESTORATIVE SOMETIMES TO MAKE IT A MORE SOVEREIGN SPECIFIC HE WAS SO KIND AS TO SQUEEZE ORANGE JUICE INTO IT OR TO STIR IT UP WITH GINGER OR DISSOLVE A PEPPERMINT DROP IN IT AND ALTHOUGH I CANNOT ASSERT THAT THE FLAVOUR WAS IMPROVED BY THESE EXPERIMENTS OR THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE COMPOUND ONE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN FOR A STOMACHIC THE LAST THING AT NIGHT AND THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING I DRANK IT GRATEFULLY AND WAS VERY SENSIBLE OF HIS ATTENTION WE SEEM TO ME TO HAVE BEEN MONTHS OVER PEREGRINE AND MONTHS MORE OVER THE OTHER STORIES THE INSTITUTION NEVER FLAGGED FOR WANT OF A STORY I AM CERTAIN AND THE WINE LASTED OUT ALMOST AS WELL AS THE MATTER POOR TRADDLESI NEVER THINK OF THAT BOY BUT WITH A STRANGE DISPOSITION TO LAUGH AND WITH TEARS IN MY EYESWAS A SORT OF CHORUS IN GENERAL AND AFFECTED TO BE CONVULSED WITH MIRTH AT THE COMIC PARTS AND TO BE OVERCOME WITH FEAR WHEN THERE WAS ANY PASSAGE OF AN ALARMING CHARACTER IN THE NARRATIVE THIS RATHER PUT ME OUT VERY OFTEN IT WAS A GREAT JEST OF HIS I RECOLLECT TO PRETEND THAT HE COULDNT KEEP HIS TEETH FROM CHATTERING WHENEVER MENTION WAS MADE OF AN ALGUAZILL IN CONNEXION WITH THE ADVENTURES OF GIL BLAS AND I REMEMBER THAT WHEN GIL BLAS MET THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS IN MADRID THIS UNLUCKY JOKER COUNTERFEITED SUCH AN AGUE OF TERROR THAT HE WAS OVERHEARD BY MR CREAKLE WHO WAS PROWLING ABOUT THE PASSAGE AND HANDSOMELY FLOGGED FOR DISORDERLY CONDUCT IN THE BEDROOM WHATEVER I HAD WITHIN ME THAT WAS ROMANTIC AND DREAMY WAS ENCOURAGED BY SO MUCH STORYTELLING IN THE DARK AND IN THAT RESPECT THE PURSUIT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN VERY PROFITABLE TO ME BUT THE BEING CHERISHED AS A KIND OF PLAYTHING IN MY ROOM AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT OF MINE WAS BRUITED ABOUT AMONG THE BOYS AND ATTRACTED A GOOD DEAL OF NOTICE TO ME THOUGH I WAS THE YOUNGEST THERE STIMULATED ME TO EXERTION IN A SCHOOL CARRIED ON BY SHEER CRUELTY WHETHER IT IS PRESIDED OVER BY A DUNCE OR NOT THERE IS NOT LIKELY TO BE MUCH LEARNT I BELIEVE OUR BOYS WERE GENERALLY AS IGNORANT A SET AS ANY SCHOOLBOYS IN EXISTENCE THEY WERE TOO MUCH TROUBLED AND KNOCKED ABOUT TO LEARN THEY COULD NO MORE DO THAT TO ADVANTAGE THAN ANY ONE CAN DO ANYTHING TO ADVANTAGE IN A LIFE OF CONSTANT MISFORTUNE TORMENT AND WORRY BUT MY LITTLE VANITY AND STEERFORTHS HELP URGED ME ON SOMEHOW AND WITHOUT SAVING ME FROM MUCH IF ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF PUNISHMENT MADE ME FOR THE TIME I WAS THERE AN EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL BODY INSOMUCH THAT I DID STEADILY PICK UP SOME CRUMBS OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS I WAS MUCH ASSISTED BY MR MELL WHO HAD A LIKING FOR ME THAT I AM GRATEFUL TO REMEMBER IT ALWAYS GAVE ME PAIN TO OBSERVE THAT STEERFORTH TREATED HIM WITH SYSTEMATIC DISPARAGEMENT AND SELDOM LOST AN OCCASION OF WOUNDING HIS FEELINGS OR INDUCING OTHERS TO DO SO THIS TROUBLED ME THE MORE FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE I HAD SOON TOLD STEERFORTH FROM WHOM I COULD NO MORE KEEP SUCH A SECRET THAN I COULD KEEP A CAKE OR ANY OTHER TANGIBLE POSSESSION ABOUT THE TWO OLD WOMEN MR MELL HAD TAKEN ME TO SEE AND I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID THAT STEERFORTH WOULD LET IT OUT AND TWIT HIM WITH IT WE LITTLE THOUGHT ANY ONE OF US I DARE SAY WHEN I ATE MY BREAKFAST THAT FIRST MORNING AND WENT TO SLEEP UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE PEACOCKS FEATHERS TO THE SOUND OF THE FLUTE WHAT CONSEQUENCES WOULD COME OF THE INTRODUCTION INTO THOSE ALMSHOUSES OF MY INSIGNIFICANT PERSON BUT THE VISIT HAD ITS UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES AND OF A SERIOUS SORT TOO IN THEIR WAY ONE DAY WHEN MR CREAKLE KEPT THE HOUSE FROM INDISPOSITION WHICH NATURALLY DIFFUSED A LIVELY JOY THROUGH THE SCHOOL THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF NOISE IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNINGS WORK THE GREAT RELIEF AND SATISFACTION EXPERIENCED BY THE BOYS MADE THEM DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AND THOUGH THE DREADED TUNGAY BROUGHT HIS WOODEN LEG IN TWICE OR THRICE AND TOOK NOTES OF THE PRINCIPAL OFFENDERS NAMES NO GREAT IMPRESSION WAS MADE BY IT AS THEY WERE PRETTY SURE OF GETTING INTO TROUBLE TOMORROW DO WHAT THEY WOULD AND THOUGHT IT WISE NO DOUBT TO ENJOY THEMSELVES TODAY IT WAS PROPERLY A HALFHOLIDAY BEING SATURDAY BUT AS THE NOISE IN THE PLAYGROUND WOULD HAVE DISTURBED MR CREAKLE AND THE WEATHER WAS NOT FAVOURABLE FOR GOING OUT WALKING WE WERE ORDERED INTO SCHOOL IN THE AFTERNOON AND SET SOME LIGHTER TASKS THAN USUAL WHICH WERE MADE FOR THE OCCASION IT WAS THE DAY OF THE WEEK ON WHICH MR SHARP WENT OUT TO GET HIS WIG CURLED SO MR MELL WHO ALWAYS DID THE DRUDGERY WHATEVER IT WAS KEPT SCHOOL BY HIMSELF IF I COULD ASSOCIATE THE IDEA OF A BULL OR A BEAR WITH ANYONE SO MILD AS MR MELL I SHOULD THINK OF HIM IN CONNEXION WITH THAT AFTERNOON WHEN THE UPROAR WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AS OF ONE OF THOSE ANIMALS BAITED BY A THOUSAND DOGS I RECALL HIM BENDING HIS ACHING HEAD SUPPORTED ON HIS BONY HAND OVER THE BOOK ON HIS DESK AND WRETCHEDLY ENDEAVOURING TO GET ON WITH HIS TIRESOME WORK AMIDST AN UPROAR THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS GIDDY BOYS STARTED IN AND OUT OF THEIR PLACES PLAYING AT PUSS IN THE CORNER WITH OTHER BOYS THERE WERE LAUGHING BOYS SINGING BOYS TALKING BOYS DANCING BOYS HOWLING BOYS BOYS SHUFFLED WITH THEIR FEET BOYS WHIRLED ABOUT HIM GRINNING MAKING FACES MIMICKING HIM BEHIND HIS BACK AND BEFORE HIS EYES MIMICKING HIS POVERTY HIS BOOTS HIS COAT HIS MOTHER EVERYTHING BELONGING TO HIM THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD CONSIDERATION FOR SILENCE CRIED MR MELL SUDDENLY RISING UP AND STRIKING HIS DESK WITH THE BOOK WHAT DOES THIS MEAN ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAR IT ITS MADDENING HOW CAN YOU DO IT TO ME BOYS IT WAS MY BOOK THAT HE STRUCK HIS DESK WITH AND AS I STOOD BESIDE HIM FOLLOWING HIS EYE AS IT GLANCED ROUND THE ROOM I SAW THE BOYS ALL STOP SOME SUDDENLY SURPRISED SOME HALF AFRAID AND SOME SORRY PERHAPS STEERFORTHS PLACE WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCHOOL AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE LONG ROOM HE WAS LOUNGING WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL AND HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND LOOKED AT MR MELL WITH HIS MOUTH SHUT UP AS IF HE WERE WHISTLING WHEN MR MELL LOOKED AT HIM SILENCE MR STEERFORTH SAID MR MELL SILENCE YOURSELF SAID STEERFORTH TURNING RED WHOM ARE YOU TALKING TO SIT DOWN SAID MR MELL SIT DOWN YOURSELF SAID STEERFORTH AND MIND YOUR BUSINESS THERE WAS A TITTER AND SOME APPLAUSE BUT MR MELL WAS SO WHITE THAT SILENCE IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDED AND ONE BOY WHO HAD DARTED OUT BEHIND HIM TO IMITATE HIS MOTHER AGAIN CHANGED HIS MIND AND PRETENDED TO WANT A PEN MENDED IF YOU THINK STEERFORTH SAID MR MELL THAT I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE POWER YOU CAN ESTABLISH OVER ANY MIND HEREHE LAID HIS HAND WITHOUT CONSIDERING WHAT HE DID AS I SUPPOSED UPON MY HEADOR THAT I HAVE NOT OBSERVED YOU WITHIN A FEW MINUTES URGING YOUR JUNIORS ON TO EVERY SORT OF OUTRAGE AGAINST ME YOU ARE MISTAKEN I DONT GIVE MYSELF THE TROUBLE OF THINKING AT ALL ABOUT YOU SAID STEERFORTH COOLLY SO IM NOT MISTAKEN AS IT HAPPENS AND WHEN YOU MAKE USE OF YOUR POSITION OF FAVOURITISM HERE SIR PURSUED MR MELL WITH HIS LIP TREMBLING VERY MUCH TO INSULT A GENTLEMAN A WHATWHERE IS HE SAID STEERFORTH HERE SOMEBODY CRIED OUT SHAME J STEERFORTH TOO BAD IT WAS TRADDLES WHOM MR MELL INSTANTLY DISCOMFITED BY BIDDING HIM HOLD HIS TONGUE TO INSULT ONE WHO IS NOT FORTUNATE IN LIFE SIR AND WHO NEVER GAVE YOU THE LEAST OFFENCE AND THE MANY REASONS FOR NOT INSULTING WHOM YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH AND WISE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND SAID MR MELL WITH HIS LIPS TREMBLING MORE AND MORE YOU COMMIT A MEAN AND BASE ACTION YOU CAN SIT DOWN OR STAND UP AS YOU PLEASE SIR COPPERFIELD GO ON YOUNG COPPERFIELD SAID STEERFORTH COMING FORWARD UP THE ROOM STOP A BIT I TELL YOU WHAT MR MELL ONCE FOR ALL WHEN YOU TAKE THE LIBERTY OF CALLING ME MEAN OR BASE OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT YOU ARE AN IMPUDENT BEGGAR YOU ARE ALWAYS A BEGGAR YOU KNOW BUT WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU ARE AN IMPUDENT BEGGAR I AM NOT CLEAR WHETHER HE WAS GOING TO STRIKE MR MELL OR MR MELL WAS GOING TO STRIKE HIM OR THERE WAS ANY SUCH INTENTION ON EITHER SIDE I SAW A RIGIDITY COME UPON THE WHOLE SCHOOL AS IF THEY HAD BEEN TURNED INTO STONE AND FOUND MR CREAKLE IN THE MIDST OF US WITH TUNGAY AT HIS SIDE AND MRS AND MISS CREAKLE LOOKING IN AT THE DOOR AS IF THEY WERE FRIGHTENED MR MELL WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS DESK AND HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS SAT FOR SOME MOMENTS QUITE STILL MR MELL SAID MR CREAKLE SHAKING HIM BY THE ARM AND HIS WHISPER WAS SO AUDIBLE NOW THAT TUNGAY FELT IT UNNECESSARY TO REPEAT HIS WORDS YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN YOURSELF I HOPE NO SIR NO RETURNED THE MASTER SHOWING HIS FACE AND SHAKING HIS HEAD AND RUBBING HIS HANDS IN GREAT AGITATION NO SIR NO I HAVE REMEMBERED MYSELF INO MR CREAKLE I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN MYSELF II HAVE REMEMBERED MYSELF SIR IICOULD WISH YOU HAD REMEMBERED ME

UPON THE FORM CLOSE BY AND SAT UPON THE DESK AFTER STILL LOOKING HARD AT MR MELL FROM HIS THRONE AS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND RUBBED HIS HANDS AND REMAINED IN THE SAME STATE OF AGITATION MR CREAKLE TURNED TO STEERFORTH AND SAID NOW SIR AS HE DONT CONDESCEND TO TELL ME WHAT IS THIS STEERFORTH EVADED THE QUESTION FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOOKING IN SCORN AND ANGER ON HIS OPPONENT AND REMAINING SILENT I COULD NOT HELP THINKING EVEN IN THAT INTERVAL I REMEMBER WHAT A NOBLE FELLOW HE WAS IN APPEARANCE AND HOW HOMELY AND PLAIN MR MELL LOOKED OPPOSED TO HIM WHAT DID HE MEAN BY TALKING ABOUT FAVOURITES THEN SAID STEERFORTH AT LENGTH FAVOURITES REPEATED MR CREAKLE WITH THE VEINS IN HIS FOREHEAD SWELLING QUICKLY WHO TALKED ABOUT FAVOURITES HE DID SAID STEERFORTH AND PRAY WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT SIR

GENTLY ON THE SHOULDERS JAMES STEERFORTH THE BEST WISH I CAN LEAVE YOU IS THAT YOU MAY COME TO BE ASHAMED OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TODAY AT PRESENT I WOULD PREFER TO SEE YOU ANYTHING RATHER THAN A FRIEND TO ME OR TO ANYONE IN WHOM I FEEL AN INTEREST ONCE MORE HE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER AND THEN TAKING HIS FLUTE AND A FEW BOOKS FROM HIS DESK AND LEAVING THE KEY IN IT FOR HIS SUCCESSOR HE WENT OUT OF THE SCHOOL WITH HIS PROPERTY UNDER HIS ARM MR CREAKLE THEN MADE A SPEECH THROUGH TUNGAY IN WHICH HE THANKED STEERFORTH FOR ASSERTING THOUGH PERHAPS TOO WARMLY THE INDEPENDENCE AND RESPECTABILITY OF SALEM HOUSE AND WHICH HE WOUND UP BY SHAKING HANDS WITH STEERFORTH WHILE WE GAVE THREE CHEERSI DID NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT FOR BUT I SUPPOSED FOR STEERFORTH AND SO JOINED IN THEM ARDENTLY THOUGH I FELT MISERABLE MR CREAKLE THEN CANED TOMMY TRADDLES FOR BEING DISCOVERED IN TEARS INSTEAD OF CHEERS ON ACCOUNT OF MR MELLS DEPARTURE AND WENT BACK TO HIS SOFA OR HIS BED OR WHEREVER HE HAD COME FROM WE WERE LEFT TO OURSELVES NOW AND LOOKED VERY BLANK I RECOLLECT ON ONE ANOTHER FOR MYSELF I FELT SO MUCH SELFREPROACH AND CONTRITION FOR MY PART IN WHAT HAD HAPPENED THAT NOTHING WOULD HAVE ENABLED ME TO KEEP BACK MY TEARS BUT THE FEAR THAT STEERFORTH WHO OFTEN LOOKED AT ME I SAW MIGHT THINK IT UNFRIENDLYOR I SHOULD RATHER SAY CONSIDERING OUR RELATIVE AGES AND THE FEELING WITH WHICH I REGARDED HIM UNDUTIFULIF I SHOWED THE EMOTION WHICH DISTRESSED ME HE WAS VERY ANGRY WITH TRADDLES AND SAID HE WAS GLAD HE HAD CAUGHT IT POOR TRADDLES WHO HAD PASSED THE STAGE OF LYING WITH HIS HEAD UPON THE DESK AND WAS RELIEVING HIMSELF AS USUAL WITH A BURST OF SKELETONS SAID HE DIDNT CARE MR MELL WAS ILLUSED WHO HAS ILLUSED HIM YOU GIRL SAID STEERFORTH WHY YOU HAVE RETURNED TRADDLES WHAT HAVE I DONE SAID STEERFORTH WHAT HAVE YOU DONE RETORTED TRADDLES HURT HIS FEELINGS AND LOST HIM HIS SITUATION HIS FEELINGS REPEATED STEERFORTH DISDAINFULLY HIS FEELINGS WILL SOON GET THE BETTER OF IT ILL BE BOUND HIS FEELINGS ARE NOT LIKE YOURS MISS TRADDLES AS TO HIS SITUATIONWHICH WAS A PRECIOUS ONE WASNT ITDO YOU SUPPOSE I AM NOT GOING TO WRITE HOME AND TAKE CARE THAT HE GETS SOME MONEY POLLY WE THOUGHT THIS INTENTION VERY NOBLE IN STEERFORTH WHOSE MOTHER WAS A WIDOW AND RICH AND WOULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING IT WAS SAID THAT HE ASKED HER WE WERE ALL EXTREMELY GLAD TO SEE TRADDLES SO PUT DOWN AND EXALTED STEERFORTH TO THE SKIES ESPECIALLY WHEN HE TOLD US AS HE CONDESCENDED TO DO THAT WHAT HE HAD DONE HAD BEEN DONE EXPRESSLY FOR US AND FOR OUR CAUSE AND THAT HE HAD CONFERRED A GREAT BOON UPON US BY UNSELFISHLY DOING IT BUT I MUST SAY THAT WHEN I WAS GOING ON WITH A STORY IN THE DARK THAT NIGHT MR MELLS OLD FLUTE SEEMED MORE THAN ONCE TO SOUND MOURNFULLY IN MY EARS AND THAT WHEN AT LAST STEERFORTH WAS TIRED AND I LAY DOWN IN MY BED I FANCIED IT PLAYING SO SORROWFULLY SOMEWHERE THAT I WAS QUITE WRETCHED I SOON FORGOT HIM IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF STEERFORTH WHO IN AN EASY AMATEUR WAY AND WITHOUT ANY BOOK HE SEEMED TO ME TO KNOW EVERYTHING BY HEART TOOK SOME OF HIS CLASSES UNTIL A NEW MASTER WAS FOUND THE NEW MASTER CAME FROM A GRAMMAR SCHOOL AND BEFORE HE ENTERED ON HIS DUTIES DINED IN THE PARLOUR ONE DAY TO BE INTRODUCED TO STEERFORTH STEERFORTH APPROVED OF HIM HIGHLY AND TOLD US HE WAS A BRICK WITHOUT EXACTLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT LEARNED DISTINCTION WAS MEANT BY THIS I RESPECTED HIM GREATLY FOR IT AND HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER OF HIS SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE THOUGH HE NEVER TOOK THE PAINS WITH MENOT THAT I WAS ANYBODYTHAT MR MELL HAD TAKEN THERE WAS ONLY ONE OTHER EVENT IN THIS HALFYEAR OUT OF THE DAILY SCHOOLLIFE THAT MADE AN IMPRESSION UPON ME WHICH STILL SURVIVES IT SURVIVES FOR MANY REASONS ONE AFTERNOON WHEN WE WERE ALL HARASSED INTO A STATE OF DIRE CONFUSION AND MR CREAKLE WAS LAYING ABOUT HIM DREADFULLY TUNGAY CAME IN AND CALLED OUT IN HIS USUAL STRONG WAY VISITORS FOR COPPERFIELD A FEW WORDS WERE INTERCHANGED BETWEEN HIM AND MR CREAKLE AS WHO THE VISITORS WERE AND WHAT ROOM THEY WERE TO BE SHOWN INTO AND THEN I WHO HAD ACCORDING TO CUSTOM STOOD UP ON THE ANNOUNCEMENT BEING MADE AND FELT QUITE FAINT WITH ASTONISHMENT WAS TOLD TO GO BY THE BACK STAIRS AND GET A CLEAN FRILL ON BEFORE I REPAIRED TO THE DININGROOM THESE ORDERS I OBEYED IN SUCH A FLUTTER AND HURRY OF MY YOUNG SPIRITS AS I HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE AND WHEN I GOT TO THE PARLOUR DOOR AND THE THOUGHT CAME INTO MY HEAD THAT IT MIGHT BE MY MOTHERI HAD ONLY THOUGHT OF MR OR MISS MURDSTONE UNTIL THENI DREW BACK MY HAND FROM THE LOCK AND STOPPED TO HAVE A SOB BEFORE I WENT IN AT FIRST I SAW NOBODY BUT FEELING A PRESSURE AGAINST THE DOOR I LOOKED ROUND IT AND THERE TO MY AMAZEMENT WERE MR PEGGOTTY AND HAM DUCKING AT ME WITH THEIR HATS AND SQUEEZING ONE ANOTHER AGAINST THE WALL I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING BUT IT WAS MUCH MORE IN THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM THAN AT THE APPEARANCE THEY MADE WE SHOOK HANDS IN A VERY CORDIAL WAY AND I LAUGHED AND LAUGHED UNTIL I PULLED OUT MY POCKETHANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED MY EYES MR PEGGOTTY WHO NEVER SHUT HIS MOUTH ONCE I REMEMBER DURING THE VISIT SHOWED GREAT CONCERN WHEN HE SAW ME DO THIS AND NUDGED HAM TO SAY SOMETHING CHEER UP MASR

DARE SAY THEY WOULD HAVE SAID MUCH MORE ABOUT HER IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN ABASHED BY THE UNEXPECTED COMING IN OF STEERFORTH WHO SEEING ME IN A CORNER SPEAKING WITH TWO STRANGERS STOPPED IN A SONG HE WAS SINGING AND SAID I DIDNT KNOW YOU WERE HERE YOUNG COPPERFIELD FOR IT WAS NOT THE USUAL VISITING ROOM AND CROSSED BY US ON HIS WAY OUT I AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT WAS IN THE PRIDE OF HAVING SUCH A FRIEND

I DECIDED THAT WAS NONSENSE WE TRANSPORTED THE SHELLFISH OR THE RELISH AS MR PEGGOTTY HAD MODESTLY CALLED IT UP INTO OUR ROOM UNOBSERVED AND MADE A GREAT SUPPER THAT EVENING BUT TRADDLES COULDNT GET HAPPILY OUT OF IT HE WAS TOO UNFORTUNATE EVEN TO COME THROUGH A SUPPER LIKE ANYBODY ELSE HE WAS TAKEN ILL IN THE NIGHTQUITE PROSTRATE HE WASIN CONSEQUENCE OF CRAB AND AFTER BEING DRUGGED WITH BLACK DRAUGHTS AND BLUE PILLS TO AN EXTENT WHICH DEMPLE WHOSE FATHER WAS A DOCTOR SAID WAS ENOUGH TO UNDERMINE A HORSES CONSTITUTION RECEIVED A CANING AND SIX CHAPTERS OF GREEK TESTAMENT FOR REFUSING TO CONFESS THE REST OF THE HALFYEAR IS A JUMBLE IN MY RECOLLECTION OF THE DAILY STRIFE AND STRUGGLE OF OUR LIVES OF THE WANING SUMMER AND THE CHANGING SEASON OF THE FROSTY MORNINGS WHEN WE WERE RUNG OUT OF BED AND THE COLD COLD SMELL OF THE DARK NIGHTS WHEN WE WERE RUNG INTO BED AGAIN OF THE EVENING SCHOOLROOM DIMLY LIGHTED AND INDIFFERENTLY WARMED AND THE MORNING SCHOOLROOM WHICH WAS NOTHING BUT A GREAT SHIVERINGMACHINE OF THE ALTERNATION OF BOILED BEEF WITH ROAST BEEF AND BOILED MUTTON WITH ROAST MUTTON OF CLODS OF BREADANDBUTTER DOGSEARED LESSONBOOKS CRACKED SLATES TEARBLOTTED COPYBOOKS CANINGS RULERINGS HAIRCUTTINGS RAINY SUNDAYS SUETPUDDINGS AND A DIRTY ATMOSPHERE OF INK SURROUNDING ALL I WELL REMEMBER THOUGH HOW THE DISTANT IDEA OF THE HOLIDAYS AFTER SEEMING FOR AN IMMENSE TIME TO BE A STATIONARY SPECK BEGAN TO COME TOWARDS US AND TO GROW AND GROW HOW FROM COUNTING MONTHS WE CAME TO WEEKS AND THEN TO DAYS AND HOW I THEN BEGAN TO BE AFRAID THAT I SHOULD NOT BE SENT FOR AND WHEN I LEARNT FROM STEERFORTH THAT I HAD BEEN SENT FOR AND WAS CERTAINLY TO GO HOME HAD DIM FOREBODINGS THAT I MIGHT BREAK MY LEG FIRST HOW THE BREAKINGUP DAY CHANGED ITS PLACE FAST AT LAST FROM THE WEEK AFTER NEXT TO NEXT WEEK THIS WEEK THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW TOMORROW TODAY TONIGHTWHEN I WAS INSIDE THE YARMOUTH MAIL AND GOING HOME I HAD MANY A BROKEN SLEEP INSIDE THE YARMOUTH MAIL AND MANY AN INCOHERENT DREAM OF ALL THESE THINGS BUT WHEN I AWOKE AT INTERVALS THE GROUND OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WAS NOT THE PLAYGROUND OF SALEM HOUSE AND THE SOUND IN MY EARS WAS NOT THE SOUND OF MR CREAKLE GIVING IT TO TRADDLES BUT THE SOUND OF THE COACHMAN TOUCHING UP THE HORSES CHAPTER MY HOLIDAYS ESPECIALLY ONE HAPPY AFTERNOON WHEN WE ARRIVED BEFORE DAY AT THE INN WHERE THE MAIL STOPPED WHICH WAS NOT THE INN WHERE MY FRIEND THE WAITER LIVED I WAS SHOWN UP TO A NICE LITTLE BEDROOM WITH DOLPHIN PAINTED ON THE DOOR VERY COLD I WAS I KNOW NOTWITHSTANDING THE HOT TEA THEY HAD GIVEN ME BEFORE A LARGE FIRE DOWNSTAIRS AND VERY GLAD I WAS TO TURN INTO THE DOLPHINS BED PULL THE DOLPHINS BLANKETS ROUND MY HEAD AND GO TO SLEEP MR BARKIS THE CARRIER WAS TO CALL FOR ME IN THE MORNING AT NINE OCLOCK I GOT UP AT EIGHT A LITTLE GIDDY FROM THE SHORTNESS OF MY NIGHTS REST AND WAS READY FOR HIM BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME HE RECEIVED ME EXACTLY AS IF NOT FIVE MINUTES HAD ELAPSED SINCE WE WERE LAST TOGETHER AND I

ACCUSTOMED PACE YOU LOOK VERY WELL MR BARKIS I SAID THINKING HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IT MR BARKIS RUBBED HIS CHEEK WITH HIS CUFF AND THEN LOOKED AT HIS CUFF AS IF HE EXPECTED TO FIND SOME OF THE BLOOM

ACCOMPANIED WITH A NUDGE OF HIS ELBOW THAT GAVE ME QUITE A STITCH IN MY SIDE AFTER THAT HE SLOUCHED OVER HIS HORSE IN HIS USUAL MANNER AND MADE NO OTHER REFERENCE TO THE SUBJECT EXCEPT HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS TAKING A PIECE OF CHALK FROM HIS POCKET AND WRITING UP INSIDE THE TILT OF THE CART CLARA PEGGOTTYAPPARENTLY AS A PRIVATE MEMORANDUM AH WHAT A STRANGE FEELING IT WAS TO BE GOING HOME WHEN IT WAS NOT HOME AND TO FIND THAT EVERY OBJECT I LOOKED AT REMINDED ME OF THE HAPPY OLD HOME WHICH WAS LIKE A DREAM I COULD NEVER DREAM AGAIN THE DAYS WHEN MY MOTHER AND I AND PEGGOTTY WERE ALL IN ALL TO ONE ANOTHER AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO COME BETWEEN US ROSE UP BEFORE ME SO SORROWFULLY ON THE ROAD THAT I AM NOT SURE I WAS GLAD TO BE THERENOT SURE BUT THAT I WOULD RATHER HAVE REMAINED AWAY AND FORGOTTEN IT IN STEERFORTHS COMPANY BUT THERE I WAS AND SOON I WAS AT OUR HOUSE WHERE THE BARE OLD ELMTREES WRUNG THEIR MANY HANDS IN THE BLEAK WINTRY AIR AND SHREDS OF THE OLD ROOKSNESTS DRIFTED AWAY UPON THE WIND THE CARRIER PUT MY BOX DOWN AT THE GARDENGATE AND LEFT ME I WALKED ALONG THE PATH TOWARDS THE HOUSE GLANCING AT THE WINDOWS AND FEARING AT EVERY STEP TO SEE MR MURDSTONE OR MISS MURDSTONE LOWERING OUT OF ONE OF THEM NO FACE APPEARED HOWEVER AND BEING COME TO THE HOUSE AND KNOWING HOW TO OPEN THE DOOR BEFORE DARK WITHOUT KNOCKING I WENT IN WITH A QUIET TIMID STEP GOD KNOWS HOW INFANTINE THE MEMORY MAY HAVE BEEN THAT WAS AWAKENED WITHIN ME BY THE SOUND OF MY MOTHERS VOICE IN THE OLD PARLOUR WHEN I SET FOOT IN THE HALL SHE WAS SINGING IN A LOW TONE I THINK I MUST HAVE LAIN IN HER ARMS AND HEARD HER SINGING SO TO ME WHEN I WAS BUT A BABY THE STRAIN WAS NEW TO ME AND YET IT WAS SO OLD THAT IT FILLED MY HEART BRIMFULL LIKE A FRIEND COME BACK FROM A LONG ABSENCE I BELIEVED FROM THE SOLITARY AND THOUGHTFUL WAY IN WHICH MY MOTHER MURMURED HER SONG THAT SHE WAS ALONE AND I WENT SOFTLY INTO THE ROOM SHE WAS SITTING BY THE FIRE SUCKLING AN INFANT WHOSE TINY HAND SHE HELD AGAINST HER NECK HER EYES WERE LOOKING DOWN UPON ITS FACE AND SHE SAT SINGING TO IT I WAS SO FAR RIGHT THAT SHE HAD NO OTHER COMPANION I SPOKE TO HER AND SHE STARTED AND CRIED OUT BUT SEEING ME SHE CALLED ME HER DEAR DAVY HER OWN BOY AND COMING HALF ACROSS THE ROOM TO MEET ME KNEELED DOWN UPON THE GROUND AND KISSED ME AND LAID MY HEAD DOWN ON HER BOSOM NEAR THE LITTLE CREATURE THAT WAS NESTLING THERE AND PUT ITS HAND TO MY LIPS I WISH I HAD DIED I WISH I HAD DIED THEN WITH THAT FEELING IN MY HEART I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FIT FOR HEAVEN THAN I EVER HAVE BEEN SINCE HE IS YOUR BROTHER SAID MY MOTHER FONDLING ME DAVY MY PRETTY BOY MY POOR CHILD THEN SHE KISSED ME MORE AND MORE AND CLASPED ME ROUND THE NECK THIS SHE WAS DOING WHEN PEGGOTTY CAME RUNNING IN AND BOUNCED DOWN ON THE GROUND BESIDE US AND WENT MAD ABOUT US BOTH FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IT SEEMED THAT I HAD NOT BEEN EXPECTED SO SOON THE CARRIER BEING MUCH BEFORE HIS USUAL TIME IT SEEMED TOO THAT MR AND MISS MURDSTONE HAD GONE OUT UPON A VISIT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND WOULD NOT RETURN BEFORE NIGHT I HAD NEVER HOPED FOR THIS I HAD NEVER THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT WE THREE COULD BE TOGETHER UNDISTURBED ONCE MORE AND I FELT FOR THE TIME AS IF THE OLD DAYS WERE COME BACK WE DINED TOGETHER BY THE FIRESIDE PEGGOTTY WAS IN ATTENDANCE TO WAIT UPON US BUT MY MOTHER WOULDNT LET HER DO IT AND MADE HER DINE WITH US I HAD MY OWN OLD PLATE WITH A BROWN VIEW OF A MANOFWAR IN FULL SAIL UPON IT WHICH PEGGOTTY HAD HOARDED SOMEWHERE ALL THE TIME I HAD BEEN AWAY AND WOULD NOT HAVE HAD BROKEN SHE SAID FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS I HAD MY OWN OLD MUG WITH DAVID ON IT AND MY OWN OLD LITTLE KNIFE AND FORK THAT WOULDNT CUT WHILE WE WERE AT TABLE I THOUGHT IT A FAVOURABLE OCCASION TO TELL PEGGOTTY ABOUT MR BARKIS WHO BEFORE I HAD FINISHED WHAT I HAD TO TELL HER BEGAN TO LAUGH AND THROW HER APRON OVER HER FACE PEGGOTTY SAID MY MOTHER WHATS THE MATTER PEGGOTTY ONLY LAUGHED THE MORE AND HELD HER APRON TIGHT OVER HER FACE WHEN MY MOTHER TRIED TO PULL IT AWAY AND SAT AS IF HER HEAD WERE IN A BAG WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU STUPID CREATURE SAID MY MOTHER LAUGHING OH DRAT THE MAN CRIED PEGGOTTY HE WANTS TO MARRY ME IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD

ATTACKS WENT ON WITH HER DINNER I REMARKED THAT MY MOTHER THOUGH SHE SMILED WHEN PEGGOTTY LOOKED AT HER BECAME MORE SERIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL I HAD SEEN AT FIRST THAT SHE WAS CHANGED HER FACE WAS VERY PRETTY STILL BUT IT LOOKED CAREWORN AND TOO DELICATE AND HER HAND WAS SO THIN AND WHITE THAT IT SEEMED TO ME TO BE ALMOST TRANSPARENT BUT THE CHANGE TO WHICH I NOW REFER WAS SUPERADDED TO THIS IT WAS

WHICH WERE ENGENDERED IN HER AFFECTIONATE NATURE STEALING DOWN HER FACE HE TAKES GREAT PAINS WITH ME AND I OUGHT TO BE VERY THANKFUL TO HIM AND VERY SUBMISSIVE TO HIM EVEN IN MY THOUGHTS AND WHEN I AM NOT PEGGOTTY I WORRY AND CONDEMN MYSELF AND FEEL DOUBTFUL OF MY OWN HEART AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO PEGGOTTY SAT WITH HER CHIN ON THE FOOT OF THE STOCKING LOOKING SILENTLY AT THE FIRE THERE PEGGOTTY SAID MY MOTHER CHANGING HER TONE DONT LET US FALL OUT WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR I COULDNT BEAR IT YOU ARE MY TRUE FRIEND I KNOW IF I HAVE ANY IN THE WORLD WHEN I CALL YOU A RIDICULOUS CREATURE OR A VEXATIOUS THING OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT PEGGOTTY I ONLY MEAN THAT YOU ARE MY TRUE FRIEND AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE THE NIGHT WHEN MR COPPERFIELD FIRST BROUGHT ME HOME HERE AND YOU CAME OUT TO THE GATE TO MEET ME PEGGOTTY WAS NOT SLOW TO RESPOND AND RATIFY THE TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP BY GIVING ME ONE OF HER BEST HUGS I THINK I HAD SOME GLIMPSES OF THE REAL CHARACTER OF THIS CONVERSATION AT THE TIME BUT I AM SURE NOW THAT THE GOOD CREATURE ORIGINATED IT AND TOOK HER PART IN IT MERELY THAT MY MOTHER MIGHT COMFORT HERSELF WITH THE LITTLE CONTRADICTORY SUMMARY IN WHICH SHE HAD INDULGED THE DESIGN WAS EFFICACIOUS FOR I REMEMBER THAT MY MOTHER SEEMED MORE AT EASE DURING THE REST OF THE EVENING AND THAT PEGGOTTY OBSERVED HER LESS WHEN WE HAD HAD OUR TEA AND THE ASHES WERE THROWN UP AND THE CANDLES SNUFFED I READ PEGGOTTY A CHAPTER OUT OF THE CROCODILE BOOK IN REMEMBRANCE OF OLD TIMESSHE TOOK IT OUT OF HER POCKET I DONT KNOW WHETHER SHE HAD KEPT IT THERE EVER SINCEAND THEN WE TALKED ABOUT SALEM HOUSE WHICH BROUGHT ME ROUND AGAIN TO STEERFORTH WHO WAS MY GREAT SUBJECT WE WERE VERY HAPPY AND THAT EVENING AS THE LAST OF ITS RACE AND DESTINED EVERMORE TO CLOSE THAT VOLUME OF MY LIFE WILL NEVER PASS OUT OF MY MEMORY IT WAS ALMOST TEN OCLOCK BEFORE WE HEARD THE SOUND OF WHEELS WE ALL GOT UP THEN AND MY MOTHER SAID HURRIEDLY THAT AS IT WAS SO LATE AND MR AND MISS MURDSTONE APPROVED OF EARLY HOURS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE PERHAPS I HAD BETTER GO TO BED I KISSED HER AND WENT UPSTAIRS WITH MY CANDLE DIRECTLY BEFORE THEY CAME IN IT APPEARED TO MY CHILDISH FANCY AS I ASCENDED TO THE BEDROOM WHERE I HAD BEEN IMPRISONED THAT THEY BROUGHT A COLD BLAST OF AIR INTO THE HOUSE WHICH BLEW AWAY THE OLD FAMILIAR FEELING LIKE A FEATHER I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT GOING DOWN TO BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING AS I HAD NEVER SET EYES ON MR MURDSTONE SINCE THE DAY WHEN I COMMITTED MY MEMORABLE OFFENCE HOWEVER AS IT MUST BE DONE I WENT DOWN AFTER TWO OR THREE FALSE STARTS HALFWAY AND AS MANY RUNS BACK ON TIPTOE TO MY OWN ROOM AND PRESENTED MYSELF IN THE PARLOUR HE WAS STANDING BEFORE THE FIRE WITH HIS BACK TO IT WHILE MISS MURDSTONE MADE THE TEA HE LOOKED AT ME STEADILY AS I ENTERED BUT MADE NO SIGN OF RECOGNITION WHATEVER I WENT UP TO HIM AFTER A MOMENT OF CONFUSION AND SAID I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR I AM VERY SORRY FOR WHAT I DID AND I HOPE YOU WILL FORGIVE ME I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOU ARE SORRY DAVID HE REPLIED THE HAND HE GAVE ME WAS THE HAND I HAD BITTEN I COULD NOT RESTRAIN MY EYE FROM RESTING FOR AN INSTANT ON A RED SPOT UPON IT BUT IT WAS NOT SO RED AS I TURNED WHEN I MET THAT SINISTER EXPRESSION IN HIS FACE HOW DO YOU DO MAAM I SAID TO MISS MURDSTONE AH DEAR ME SIGHED MISS MURDSTONE GIVING ME THE TEACADDY SCOOP INSTEAD OF HER FINGERS HOW LONG ARE THE HOLIDAYS A MONTH MAAM COUNTING FROM WHEN FROM TODAY MAAM OH SAID MISS MURDSTONE THEN HERES ONE DAY OFF SHE KEPT A CALENDAR OF THE HOLIDAYS IN THIS WAY AND EVERY MORNING CHECKED A DAY OFF IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER SHE DID IT GLOOMILY UNTIL SHE CAME TO TEN BUT WHEN SHE GOT INTO TWO FIGURES SHE BECAME MORE HOPEFUL AND AS THE TIME ADVANCED EVEN JOCULAR IT WAS ON THIS VERY FIRST DAY THAT I HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO THROW HER THOUGH SHE WAS NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH WEAKNESS IN GENERAL INTO A STATE OF VIOLENT CONSTERNATION I CAME INTO THE ROOM WHERE SHE AND MY MOTHER WERE SITTING AND THE BABY WHO WAS ONLY A FEW WEEKS OLD BEING ON MY MOTHERS LAP I TOOK IT VERY CAREFULLY IN MY ARMS SUDDENLY MISS MURDSTONE GAVE SUCH A SCREAM THAT I ALL BUT DROPPED IT MY DEAR JANE CRIED MY MOTHER GOOD HEAVENS CLARA DO YOU SEE EXCLAIMED MISS MURDSTONE SEE WHAT MY DEAR JANE SAID MY MOTHER WHERE HES GOT IT CRIED MISS MURDSTONE THE BOY HAS GOT THE BABY SHE WAS LIMP WITH HORROR BUT STIFFENED HERSELF TO MAKE A DART AT ME AND TAKE IT OUT OF MY ARMS THEN SHE TURNED FAINT AND WAS SO VERY ILL THAT THEY WERE OBLIGED TO GIVE HER CHERRY BRANDY I WAS SOLEMNLY INTERDICTED BY HER ON HER RECOVERY FROM TOUCHING MY BROTHER ANY MORE ON ANY PRETENCE WHATEVER AND MY POOR MOTHER WHO I COULD SEE WISHED OTHERWISE MEEKLY CONFIRMED THE INTERDICT BY SAYING NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT MY DEAR JANE ON ANOTHER OCCASION WHEN WE THREE WERE TOGETHER THIS SAME DEAR

ALIKE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT CLARA SAID MISS MURDSTONE MY DEAR JANE FALTERED MY MOTHER A LITTLE ABASHED BY THE HARSH TONE OF THIS INQUIRY I FIND THAT THE BABYS EYES AND DAVYS ARE EXACTLY ALIKE CLARA SAID MISS MURDSTONE RISING ANGRILY YOU ARE A POSITIVE FOOL SOMETIMES MY DEAR JANE REMONSTRATED MY MOTHER A POSITIVE FOOL SAID MISS MURDSTONE WHO ELSE COULD COMPARE MY BROTHERS BABY WITH YOUR BOY THEY ARE NOT AT ALL ALIKE THEY ARE EXACTLY UNLIKE THEY ARE UTTERLY DISSIMILAR IN ALL RESPECTS I HOPE THEY WILL EVER REMAIN SO I WILL NOT SIT HERE AND HEAR SUCH COMPARISONS MADE WITH THAT SHE STALKED OUT AND MADE THE DOOR BANG AFTER HER IN SHORT I WAS NOT A FAVOURITE WITH MISS MURDSTONE IN SHORT I WAS NOT A FAVOURITE THERE WITH ANYBODY NOT EVEN WITH MYSELF FOR THOSE WHO DID LIKE ME COULD NOT SHOW IT AND THOSE WHO DID NOT SHOWED IT SO PLAINLY THAT I HAD A SENSITIVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALWAYS APPEARING CONSTRAINED BOORISH AND DULL I FELT THAT I MADE THEM AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS THEY MADE ME IF I CAME INTO THE ROOM WHERE THEY WERE AND THEY WERE TALKING TOGETHER AND MY MOTHER SEEMED CHEERFUL AN ANXIOUS CLOUD WOULD STEAL OVER HER FACE FROM THE MOMENT OF MY ENTRANCE IF MR MURDSTONE WERE IN HIS BEST HUMOUR I CHECKED HIM IF MISS MURDSTONE WERE IN HER WORST I INTENSIFIED IT I HAD PERCEPTION ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT MY MOTHER WAS THE VICTIM ALWAYS THAT SHE WAS AFRAID TO SPEAK TO ME OR TO BE KIND TO ME LEST SHE SHOULD GIVE THEM SOME OFFENCE BY HER MANNER OF DOING SO AND RECEIVE A LECTURE AFTERWARDS THAT SHE WAS NOT ONLY CEASELESSLY AFRAID OF HER OWN OFFENDING BUT OF MY OFFENDING AND UNEASILY WATCHED THEIR LOOKS IF I ONLY MOVED THEREFORE I RESOLVED TO KEEP MYSELF AS MUCH OUT OF THEIR WAY AS I COULD AND MANY A WINTRY HOUR DID I HEAR THE CHURCH CLOCK STRIKE WHEN I WAS SITTING IN MY CHEERLESS BEDROOM WRAPPED IN MY LITTLE GREATCOAT PORING OVER A BOOK IN THE EVENING SOMETIMES I WENT AND SAT WITH PEGGOTTY IN THE KITCHEN THERE I WAS COMFORTABLE AND NOT AFRAID OF BEING MYSELF BUT NEITHER OF THESE RESOURCES WAS APPROVED OF IN THE PARLOUR THE TORMENTING HUMOUR WHICH WAS DOMINANT THERE STOPPED THEM BOTH I WAS STILL HELD TO BE NECESSARY TO MY POOR MOTHERS TRAINING AND AS ONE OF HER TRIALS COULD NOT BE SUFFERED TO ABSENT MYSELF DAVID SAID MR MURDSTONE ONE DAY AFTER DINNER WHEN I WAS GOING TO LEAVE THE ROOM AS USUAL I AM SORRY TO OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE OF A SULLEN DISPOSITION AS SULKY AS A BEAR

NIGHT AND BEDTIME WHAT IRKSOME CONSTRAINT I UNDERWENT SITTING IN THE SAME ATTITUDE HOURS UPON HOURS AFRAID TO MOVE AN ARM OR A LEG LEST MISS MURDSTONE SHOULD COMPLAIN AS SHE DID ON THE LEAST PRETENCE OF MY RESTLESSNESS AND AFRAID TO MOVE AN EYE LEST SHE SHOULD LIGHT ON SOME LOOK OF DISLIKE OR SCRUTINY THAT WOULD FIND NEW CAUSE FOR COMPLAINT IN MINE WHAT INTOLERABLE DULNESS TO SIT LISTENING TO THE TICKING OF THE CLOCK AND WATCHING MISS MURDSTONES LITTLE SHINY STEEL BEADS AS SHE STRUNG THEM AND WONDERING WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER BE MARRIED AND IF SO TO WHAT SORT OF UNHAPPY MAN AND COUNTING THE DIVISIONS IN THE MOULDING OF THE CHIMNEYPIECE AND WANDERING AWAY WITH MY EYES TO THE CEILING AMONG THE CURLS AND CORKSCREWS IN THE PAPER ON THE WALL WHAT WALKS I TOOK ALONE DOWN MUDDY LANES IN THE BAD WINTER WEATHER CARRYING THAT PARLOUR AND MR AND MISS MURDSTONE IN IT EVERYWHERE A MONSTROUS LOAD THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO BEAR A DAYMARE THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF BREAKING IN A WEIGHT THAT BROODED ON MY WITS AND BLUNTED THEM WHAT MEALS I HAD IN SILENCE AND EMBARRASSMENT ALWAYS FEELING THAT THERE WERE A KNIFE AND FORK TOO MANY AND THAT MINE AN APPETITE TOO MANY AND THAT MINE A PLATE AND CHAIR TOO MANY AND THOSE MINE A SOMEBODY TOO MANY AND THAT I WHAT EVENINGS WHEN THE CANDLES CAME AND I WAS EXPECTED TO EMPLOY MYSELF BUT NOT DARING TO READ AN ENTERTAINING BOOK PORED OVER SOME HARDHEADED HARDERHEARTED TREATISE ON ARITHMETIC WHEN THE TABLES OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES SET THEMSELVES TO TUNES AS RULE BRITANNIA OR AWAY WITH MELANCHOLY WHEN THEY WOULDNT STAND STILL TO BE LEARNT BUT WOULD GO THREADING MY GRANDMOTHERS NEEDLE THROUGH MY UNFORTUNATE HEAD IN AT ONE EAR AND OUT AT THE OTHER WHAT YAWNS AND DOZES I LAPSED INTO IN SPITE OF ALL MY CARE WHAT STARTS I CAME OUT OF CONCEALED SLEEPS WITH WHAT ANSWERS I NEVER GOT TO LITTLE OBSERVATIONS THAT I RARELY MADE WHAT A BLANK SPACE I SEEMED WHICH EVERYBODY OVERLOOKED AND YET WAS IN EVERYBODYS WAY WHAT A HEAVY RELIEF IT WAS TO HEAR MISS MURDSTONE HAIL THE FIRST STROKE OF NINE AT NIGHT AND ORDER ME TO BED THUS THE HOLIDAYS LAGGED AWAY UNTIL THE MORNING CAME WHEN MISS MURDSTONE SAID HERES THE LAST DAY OFF AND GAVE ME THE CLOSING CUP OF TEA OF THE VACATION I WAS NOT SORRY TO GO I HAD LAPSED INTO A STUPID STATE BUT I WAS RECOVERING A LITTLE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO STEERFORTH ALBEIT MR CREAKLE LOOMED BEHIND HIM AGAIN MR BARKIS APPEARED AT THE GATE AND AGAIN MISS MURDSTONE IN HER WARNING VOICE SAID CLARA WHEN MY MOTHER BENT OVER ME TO BID ME FAREWELL I KISSED HER AND MY BABY BROTHER AND WAS VERY SORRY THEN BUT NOT SORRY TO GO AWAY FOR THE GULF BETWEEN US WAS THERE AND THE PARTING WAS THERE EVERY DAY AND IT IS NOT SO MUCH THE EMBRACE SHE GAVE ME THAT LIVES IN MY MIND THOUGH IT WAS AS FERVENT AS COULD BE AS WHAT FOLLOWED THE EMBRACE I WAS IN THE CARRIERS CART WHEN I HEARD HER CALLING TO ME I LOOKED OUT AND SHE STOOD AT THE GARDENGATE ALONE HOLDING HER BABY UP IN HER ARMS FOR ME TO SEE IT WAS COLD STILL WEATHER AND NOT A HAIR OF HER HEAD NOR A FOLD OF HER DRESS WAS STIRRED AS SHE LOOKED INTENTLY AT ME HOLDING UP HER CHILD SO I LOST HER SO I SAW HER AFTERWARDS IN MY SLEEP AT SCHOOLA SILENT PRESENCE NEAR MY BEDLOOKING AT ME WITH THE SAME INTENT FACEHOLDING UP HER BABY IN HER ARMS CHAPTER I HAVE A MEMORABLE BIRTHDAY I PASS OVER ALL THAT HAPPENED AT SCHOOL UNTIL THE ANNIVERSARY OF MY BIRTHDAY CAME ROUND IN MARCH EXCEPT THAT STEERFORTH WAS MORE TO BE ADMIRED THAN EVER I REMEMBER NOTHING HE WAS GOING AWAY AT THE END OF THE HALFYEAR IF NOT SOONER AND WAS MORE SPIRITED AND INDEPENDENT THAN BEFORE IN MY EYES AND THEREFORE MORE ENGAGING THAN BEFORE BUT BEYOND THIS I REMEMBER NOTHING THE GREAT REMEMBRANCE BY WHICH THAT TIME IS MARKED IN MY MIND SEEMS TO HAVE SWALLOWED UP ALL LESSER RECOLLECTIONS AND TO EXIST ALONE IT IS EVEN DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A GAP OF FULL TWO MONTHS BETWEEN MY RETURN TO SALEM HOUSE AND THE ARRIVAL OF THAT BIRTHDAY I CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE FACT WAS SO BECAUSE I KNOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO OTHERWISE I SHOULD FEEL CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS NO INTERVAL AND THAT THE ONE OCCASION TROD UPON THE OTHERS HEELS HOW WELL I RECOLLECT THE KIND OF DAY IT WAS I SMELL THE FOG THAT HUNG ABOUT THE PLACE I SEE THE HOAR FROST GHOSTLY THROUGH IT I FEEL MY RIMY HAIR FALL CLAMMY ON MY CHEEK I LOOK ALONG THE DIM PERSPECTIVE OF THE SCHOOLROOM WITH A SPUTTERING CANDLE HERE AND THERE TO LIGHT UP THE FOGGY MORNING AND THE BREATH OF THE BOYS WREATHING AND SMOKING IN THE RAW COLD AS THEY BLOW UPON THEIR FINGERS AND TAP THEIR FEET UPON THE FLOOR IT WAS AFTER BREAKFAST AND WE HAD BEEN SUMMONED IN FROM THE PLAYGROUND WHEN MR SHARP ENTERED AND SAID DAVID COPPERFIELD IS TO GO INTO THE PARLOUR I EXPECTED A HAMPER FROM PEGGOTTY AND BRIGHTENED AT THE ORDER SOME OF THE BOYS ABOUT ME PUT IN THEIR CLAIM NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GOOD THINGS AS I GOT OUT OF MY SEAT WITH GREAT ALACRITY DONT HURRY DAVID SAID MR SHARP THERES TIME ENOUGH MY BOY DONT HURRY I MIGHT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY THE FEELING TONE IN WHICH HE SPOKE IF I HAD GIVEN IT A THOUGHT BUT I GAVE IT NONE UNTIL AFTERWARDS I HURRIED AWAY TO THE PARLOUR AND THERE I FOUND MR CREAKLE SITTING AT HIS BREAKFAST WITH THE CANE AND A NEWSPAPER BEFORE HIM AND MRS CREAKLE WITH AN OPENED LETTER IN HER HAND BUT NO HAMPER DAVID COPPERFIELD SAID MRS CREAKLE LEADING ME TO A SOFA AND SITTING DOWN BESIDE ME I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU VERY PARTICULARLY I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU MY CHILD MR CREAKLE AT WHOM OF COURSE I LOOKED SHOOK HIS HEAD WITHOUT LOOKING AT ME AND STOPPED UP A SIGH WITH A VERY LARGE PIECE OF BUTTERED TOAST YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW HOW THE WORLD CHANGES EVERY DAY SAID MRS CREAKLE AND HOW THE PEOPLE IN IT PASS AWAY BUT WE ALL HAVE TO LEARN IT DAVID SOME OF US WHEN WE ARE YOUNG SOME OF US WHEN WE ARE OLD SOME OF US AT ALL TIMES OF OUR LIVES I LOOKED AT HER EARNESTLY WHEN YOU CAME AWAY FROM HOME AT THE END OF THE VACATION SAID MRS CREAKLE AFTER A PAUSE WERE THEY ALL WELL AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE WAS YOUR MAMA WELL I TREMBLED WITHOUT DISTINCTLY KNOWING WHY AND STILL LOOKED AT HER EARNESTLY MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO ANSWER BECAUSE SAID SHE I GRIEVE TO TELL YOU THAT I HEAR THIS MORNING YOUR MAMA IS VERY ILL A MIST ROSE BETWEEN MRS CREAKLE AND ME AND HER FIGURE SEEMED TO MOVE IN IT FOR AN INSTANT THEN I FELT THE BURNING TEARS RUN DOWN MY FACE AND IT WAS STEADY AGAIN SHE IS VERY DANGEROUSLY ILL SHE ADDED I KNEW ALL NOW SHE IS DEAD THERE WAS NO NEED TO TELL ME SO I HAD ALREADY BROKEN OUT INTO A DESOLATE CRY AND FELT AN ORPHAN IN THE WIDE WORLD SHE WAS VERY KIND TO ME SHE KEPT ME THERE ALL DAY AND LEFT ME ALONE SOMETIMES AND I CRIED AND WORE MYSELF TO SLEEP AND AWOKE AND CRIED AGAIN WHEN I COULD CRY NO MORE I BEGAN TO THINK AND THEN THE OPPRESSION ON MY BREAST WAS HEAVIEST AND MY GRIEF A DULL PAIN THAT THERE WAS NO EASE FOR AND YET MY THOUGHTS WERE IDLE NOT INTENT ON THE CALAMITY THAT WEIGHED UPON MY HEART BUT IDLY LOITERING NEAR IT I THOUGHT OF OUR HOUSE SHUT UP AND HUSHED I THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE BABY WHO MRS CREAKLE SAID HAD BEEN PINING AWAY FOR SOME TIME AND WHO THEY BELIEVED WOULD DIE TOO I THOUGHT OF MY FATHERS GRAVE IN THE CHURCHYARD BY OUR HOUSE AND OF MY MOTHER LYING THERE BENEATH THE TREE I KNEW SO WELL I STOOD UPON A CHAIR WHEN I WAS LEFT ALONE AND LOOKED INTO THE GLASS TO SEE HOW RED MY EYES WERE AND HOW SORROWFUL MY FACE I CONSIDERED AFTER SOME HOURS WERE GONE IF MY TEARS WERE REALLY HARD TO FLOW NOW AS THEY SEEMED TO BE WHAT IN CONNEXION WITH MY LOSS IT WOULD AFFECT ME MOST TO THINK OF WHEN I DREW NEAR HOMEFOR I WAS GOING HOME TO THE FUNERAL I AM SENSIBLE OF HAVING FELT THAT A DIGNITY ATTACHED TO ME AMONG THE REST OF THE BOYS AND THAT I WAS IMPORTANT IN MY AFFLICTION IF EVER CHILD WERE STRICKEN WITH SINCERE GRIEF I WAS BUT I REMEMBER THAT THIS IMPORTANCE WAS A KIND OF SATISFACTION TO ME WHEN I WALKED IN THE PLAYGROUND THAT AFTERNOON WHILE THE BOYS WERE IN SCHOOL WHEN I SAW THEM GLANCING AT ME OUT OF THE WINDOWS AS THEY WENT UP TO THEIR CLASSES I FELT DISTINGUISHED AND LOOKED MORE MELANCHOLY AND WALKED SLOWER WHEN SCHOOL WAS OVER AND THEY CAME OUT AND SPOKE TO ME I FELT IT RATHER GOOD IN MYSELF NOT TO BE PROUD TO ANY OF THEM AND TO TAKE EXACTLY THE SAME NOTICE OF THEM ALL AS BEFORE I WAS TO GO HOME NEXT NIGHT NOT BY THE MAIL BUT BY THE HEAVY NIGHTCOACH WHICH WAS CALLED THE FARMER AND WAS PRINCIPALLY USED BY COUNTRYPEOPLE TRAVELLING SHORT INTERMEDIATE DISTANCES UPON THE ROAD WE HAD NO STORYTELLING THAT EVENING AND TRADDLES INSISTED ON LENDING ME HIS PILLOW I DONT KNOW WHAT GOOD HE THOUGHT IT WOULD DO ME FOR I HAD ONE OF MY OWN BUT IT WAS ALL HE HAD TO LEND POOR FELLOW EXCEPT A SHEET OF LETTERPAPER FULL OF SKELETONS AND THAT HE GAVE ME AT PARTING AS A SOOTHER OF MY SORROWS AND A CONTRIBUTION TO MY PEACE OF MIND I LEFT SALEM HOUSE UPON THE MORROW AFTERNOON I LITTLE THOUGHT THEN THAT I LEFT IT NEVER TO RETURN WE TRAVELLED VERY SLOWLY ALL NIGHT AND DID NOT GET INTO YARMOUTH BEFORE NINE OR TEN OCLOCK IN THE MORNING I LOOKED OUT FOR MR BARKIS BUT HE WAS NOT THERE AND INSTEAD OF HIM A FAT SHORTWINDED MERRYLOOKING LITTLE OLD MAN IN BLACK WITH RUSTY LITTLE BUNCHES OF RIBBONS AT THE KNEES OF HIS BREECHES BLACK STOCKINGS AND A BROADBRIMMED HAT CAME PUFFING UP TO THE COACH WINDOW AND SAID MASTER COPPERFIELD YES SIR WILL YOU COME WITH ME YOUNG SIR IF YOU PLEASE HE SAID OPENING THE DOOR AND I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF TAKING YOU HOME I PUT MY HAND IN HIS WONDERING WHO HE WAS AND WE WALKED AWAY TO A SHOP IN A NARROW STREET ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN OMER DRAPER TAILOR HABERDASHER FUNERAL FURNISHER C IT WAS A CLOSE AND STIFLING LITTLE SHOP FULL OF ALL SORTS OF CLOTHING MADE AND UNMADE INCLUDING ONE WINDOW FULL OF BEAVERHATS AND BONNETS WE WENT INTO A LITTLE BACKPARLOUR BEHIND THE SHOP WHERE WE FOUND THREE YOUNG WOMEN AT WORK ON A QUANTITY OF BLACK MATERIALS WHICH WERE HEAPED UPON THE TABLE AND LITTLE BITS AND CUTTINGS OF WHICH WERE LITTERED ALL OVER THE FLOOR THERE WAS A GOOD FIRE IN THE ROOM AND A BREATHLESS SMELL OF WARM BLACK CRAPEI DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE SMELL WAS THEN BUT I KNOW NOW THE THREE YOUNG WOMEN WHO APPEARED TO BE VERY INDUSTRIOUS AND COMFORTABLE RAISED THEIR HEADS TO LOOK AT ME AND THEN WENT ON WITH THEIR WORK STITCH STITCH STITCH AT THE SAME TIME THERE CAME FROM A WORKSHOP ACROSS A LITTLE YARD OUTSIDE THE WINDOW A REGULAR SOUND OF HAMMERING THAT KEPT A KIND OF TUNE RATTATTAT RATTATTAT RATTATTAT WITHOUT ANY VARIATION WELL SAID MY CONDUCTOR TO ONE OF THE THREE YOUNG WOMEN HOW DO YOU GET ON MINNIE WE SHALL BE READY BY THE TRYINGON TIME SHE REPLIED GAILY WITHOUT LOOKING UP DONT YOU BE AFRAID FATHER MR OMER TOOK OFF HIS BROADBRIMMED HAT AND SAT DOWN AND PANTED HE WAS SO FAT THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO PANT SOME TIME BEFORE HE COULD SAY THATS RIGHT FATHER SAID MINNIE PLAYFULLY WHAT A PORPOISE YOU DO GROW WELL I DONT KNOW HOW IT IS MY DEAR HE REPLIED CONSIDERING ABOUT IT I AM RATHER SO YOU ARE SUCH A COMFORTABLE MAN YOU SEE SAID MINNIE YOU TAKE THINGS SO EASY NO USE TAKING EM OTHERWISE MY DEAR SAID MR OMER NO INDEED RETURNED HIS DAUGHTER WE ARE ALL PRETTY GAY HERE THANK HEAVEN AINT WE FATHER I HOPE SO MY DEAR SAID MR OMER AS I HAVE GOT MY BREATH NOW I THINK ILL MEASURE THIS YOUNG SCHOLAR WOULD YOU WALK INTO THE SHOP MASTER COPPERFIELD I PRECEDED MR OMER IN COMPLIANCE WITH HIS REQUEST AND AFTER SHOWING ME A ROLL OF CLOTH WHICH HE SAID WAS EXTRA SUPER AND TOO GOOD MOURNING FOR ANYTHING SHORT OF PARENTS HE TOOK MY VARIOUS DIMENSIONS AND PUT THEM DOWN IN A BOOK WHILE HE WAS RECORDING THEM HE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO HIS STOCK IN TRADE AND TO CERTAIN FASHIONS WHICH HE SAID HAD JUST COME UP AND TO CERTAIN OTHER FASHIONS WHICH HE SAID HAD JUST GONE OUT AND BY THAT SORT OF THING WE VERY OFTEN LOSE A LITTLE MINT OF MONEY SAID MR OMER BUT FASHIONS ARE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS THEY COME IN NOBODY KNOWS WHEN WHY OR HOW AND THEY GO OUT NOBODY KNOWS WHEN WHY OR HOW EVERYTHING IS LIKE LIFE IN MY OPINION IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN THAT POINT OF VIEW I WAS TOO SORROWFUL TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION WHICH WOULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN BEYOND ME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND MR OMER TOOK ME BACK INTO THE PARLOUR BREATHING WITH SOME DIFFICULTY ON THE WAY HE THEN CALLED DOWN A LITTLE BREAKNECK RANGE OF STEPS BEHIND A DOOR BRING UP THAT TEA AND BREADANDBUTTER WHICH AFTER SOME TIME DURING WHICH I SAT LOOKING ABOUT ME AND THINKING AND LISTENING TO THE STITCHING IN THE ROOM AND THE TUNE THAT WAS BEING HAMMERED ACROSS THE YARD APPEARED ON A TRAY AND TURNED OUT TO BE FOR ME I HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH YOU SAID MR OMER AFTER WATCHING ME FOR SOME MINUTES DURING WHICH I HAD NOT MADE MUCH IMPRESSION ON THE BREAKFAST FOR THE BLACK THINGS DESTROYED MY APPETITE I HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH YOU A LONG TIME MY YOUNG FRIEND HAVE YOU SIR ALL YOUR LIFE SAID MR OMER I MAY SAY BEFORE IT I KNEW YOUR FATHER BEFORE YOU HE WAS FIVE FOOT NINE AND A HALF AND HE LAYS IN FIVEANDTWENTY FOOT OF GROUND RATTATTAT RATTATTAT RATTATTAT ACROSS THE YARD HE LAYS IN FIVE AND TWENTY FOOT OF GROUND IF HE LAYS IN A FRACTION SAID MR OMER PLEASANTLY IT WAS EITHER HIS REQUEST OR HER DIRECTION I FORGET WHICH DO YOU KNOW HOW MY LITTLE BROTHER IS SIR I INQUIRED MR OMER SHOOK HIS HEAD RATTATTAT RATTATTAT RATTATTAT HE IS IN HIS MOTHERS ARMS SAID HE OH POOR LITTLE FELLOW IS HE DEAD DONT MIND IT MORE THAN YOU CAN HELP SAID MR OMER YES THE BABYS DEAD MY WOUNDS BROKE OUT AFRESH AT THIS INTELLIGENCE I LEFT THE SCARCELYTASTED BREAKFAST AND WENT AND RESTED MY HEAD ON ANOTHER TABLE IN A CORNER OF THE LITTLE ROOM WHICH MINNIE HASTILY CLEARED LEST I SHOULD SPOT THE MOURNING THAT WAS LYING THERE WITH MY TEARS SHE WAS A PRETTY GOODNATURED GIRL AND PUT MY HAIR AWAY FROM MY EYES WITH A SOFT KIND TOUCH BUT SHE WAS VERY CHEERFUL AT HAVING NEARLY FINISHED HER WORK AND BEING IN GOOD TIME AND WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM ME PRESENTLY THE TUNE LEFT OFF AND A GOODLOOKING YOUNG FELLOW CAME ACROSS THE YARD INTO THE ROOM HE HAD A HAMMER IN HIS HAND AND HIS MOUTH WAS FULL OF LITTLE NAILS WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE OUT BEFORE HE COULD SPEAK WELL JORAM SAID MR OMER HOW DO YOU GET ON ALL RIGHT SAID JORAM DONE SIR MINNIE COLOURED A LITTLE AND THE OTHER TWO GIRLS SMILED AT ONE ANOTHER WHAT YOU WERE AT IT BY CANDLELIGHT LAST NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE CLUB THEN WERE YOU SAID MR OMER SHUTTING UP ONE EYE YES SAID JORAM AS YOU SAID WE COULD MAKE A LITTLE TRIP OF IT AND GO OVER TOGETHER IF IT WAS DONE MINNIE AND MEAND YOU OH I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO LEAVE ME OUT ALTOGETHER SAID MR OMER LAUGHING TILL HE COUGHED AS YOU WAS SO GOOD AS TO SAY THAT RESUMED THE YOUNG MAN WHY I TURNED TO WITH A WILL YOU SEE WILL YOU GIVE ME YOUR OPINION OF IT I WILL SAID MR OMER RISING MY DEAR AND HE STOPPED AND TURNED TO ME WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE YOUR NO FATHER MINNIE INTERPOSED I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE AGREEABLE MY DEAR SAID MR OMER BUT PERHAPS YOURE RIGHT I CANT SAY HOW I KNEW IT WAS MY DEAR DEAR MOTHERS COFFIN THAT THEY WENT TO LOOK AT I HAD NEVER HEARD ONE MAKING I HAD NEVER SEEN ONE THAT I KNOW OFBUT IT CAME INTO MY MIND WHAT THE NOISE WAS WHILE IT WAS GOING ON AND WHEN THE YOUNG MAN ENTERED I AM SURE I KNEW WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING THE WORK BEING NOW FINISHED THE TWO GIRLS WHOSE NAMES I HAD NOT HEARD BRUSHED THE SHREDS AND THREADS FROM THEIR DRESSES AND WENT INTO THE SHOP TO PUT THAT TO RIGHTS AND WAIT FOR CUSTOMERS MINNIE STAYED BEHIND TO FOLD UP WHAT THEY HAD MADE AND PACK IT IN TWO BASKETS THIS SHE DID UPON HER KNEES HUMMING A LIVELY LITTLE TUNE THE WHILE JORAM WHO I HAD NO DOUBT WAS HER LOVER CAME IN AND STOLE A KISS FROM HER WHILE SHE WAS BUSY HE DIDNT APPEAR TO MIND ME AT ALL AND SAID HER FATHER WAS GONE FOR THE CHAISE AND HE MUST MAKE HASTE AND GET HIMSELF READY THEN HE WENT OUT AGAIN AND THEN SHE PUT HER THIMBLE AND SCISSORS IN HER POCKET AND STUCK A NEEDLE THREADED WITH BLACK THREAD NEATLY IN THE BOSOM OF HER GOWN AND PUT ON HER OUTER CLOTHING SMARTLY AT A LITTLE GLASS BEHIND THE DOOR IN WHICH I SAW THE REFLECTION OF HER PLEASED FACE ALL THIS I OBSERVED SITTING AT THE TABLE IN THE CORNER WITH MY HEAD LEANING ON MY HAND AND MY THOUGHTS RUNNING ON VERY DIFFERENT THINGS THE CHAISE SOON CAME ROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE SHOP AND THE BASKETS BEING PUT IN FIRST I WAS PUT IN NEXT AND THOSE THREE FOLLOWED I REMEMBER IT AS A KIND OF HALF CHAISECART HALF PIANOFORTEVAN PAINTED OF A SOMBRE COLOUR AND DRAWN BY A BLACK HORSE WITH A LONG TAIL THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR US ALL I DO NOT THINK I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED SO STRANGE A FEELING IN MY LIFE I AM WISER NOW PERHAPS AS THAT OF BEING WITH THEM REMEMBERING HOW THEY HAD BEEN EMPLOYED AND SEEING THEM ENJOY THE RIDE I WAS NOT ANGRY WITH THEM I WAS MORE AFRAID OF THEM AS IF I WERE CAST AWAY AMONG CREATURES WITH WHOM I HAD NO COMMUNITY OF NATURE THEY WERE VERY CHEERFUL THE OLD MAN SAT IN FRONT TO DRIVE AND THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE SAT BEHIND HIM AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE TO THEM LEANED FORWARD THE ONE ON ONE SIDE OF HIS CHUBBY FACE AND THE OTHER ON THE OTHER AND MADE A GREAT DEAL OF HIM THEY WOULD HAVE TALKED TO ME TOO BUT I HELD BACK AND MOPED IN MY CORNER SCARED BY THEIR LOVEMAKING AND HILARITY THOUGH IT WAS FAR FROM BOISTEROUS AND ALMOST WONDERING THAT NO JUDGEMENT CAME UPON THEM FOR THEIR HARDNESS OF HEART SO WHEN THEY STOPPED TO BAIT THE HORSE AND ATE AND DRANK AND ENJOYED THEMSELVES I COULD TOUCH NOTHING THAT THEY TOUCHED BUT KEPT MY FAST UNBROKEN SO WHEN WE REACHED HOME I DROPPED OUT OF THE CHAISE BEHIND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT NOT BE IN THEIR COMPANY BEFORE THOSE SOLEMN WINDOWS LOOKING BLINDLY ON ME LIKE CLOSED EYES ONCE BRIGHT AND OH HOW LITTLE NEED I HAD HAD TO THINK WHAT WOULD MOVE ME TO TEARS WHEN I CAME BACKSEEING THE WINDOW OF MY MOTHERS ROOM AND NEXT IT THAT WHICH IN THE BETTER TIME WAS MINE I WAS IN PEGGOTTYS ARMS BEFORE I GOT TO THE DOOR AND SHE TOOK ME INTO THE HOUSE HER GRIEF BURST OUT WHEN SHE FIRST SAW ME BUT SHE CONTROLLED IT SOON AND SPOKE IN WHISPERS AND WALKED SOFTLY AS IF THE DEAD COULD BE DISTURBED SHE HAD NOT BEEN IN BED I FOUND FOR A LONG TIME SHE SAT UP AT NIGHT STILL AND WATCHED AS LONG AS HER POOR DEAR PRETTY WAS ABOVE THE GROUND SHE SAID SHE WOULD NEVER DESERT HER MR MURDSTONE TOOK NO HEED OF ME WHEN I WENT INTO THE PARLOUR WHERE HE WAS BUT SAT BY THE FIRESIDE WEEPING SILENTLY AND PONDERING IN HIS ELBOWCHAIR MISS MURDSTONE WHO WAS BUSY AT HER WRITINGDESK WHICH WAS COVERED WITH LETTERS AND PAPERS GAVE ME HER COLD FINGERNAILS AND ASKED ME IN AN IRON WHISPER IF I HAD BEEN MEASURED FOR MY MOURNING I SAID YES AND YOUR SHIRTS SAID MISS MURDSTONE HAVE YOU BROUGHT EM HOME YES MAAM I HAVE BROUGHT HOME ALL MY CLOTHES THIS WAS ALL THE CONSOLATION THAT HER FIRMNESS ADMINISTERED TO ME I DO NOT DOUBT THAT SHE HAD A CHOICE PLEASURE IN EXHIBITING WHAT SHE CALLED HER SELFCOMMAND AND HER FIRMNESS AND HER STRENGTH OF MIND AND HER COMMON SENSE AND THE WHOLE DIABOLICAL CATALOGUE OF HER UNAMIABLE QUALITIES ON SUCH AN OCCASION SHE WAS PARTICULARLY PROUD OF HER TURN FOR BUSINESS AND SHE SHOWED IT NOW IN REDUCING EVERYTHING TO PEN AND INK AND BEING MOVED BY NOTHING ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY AND FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AFTERWARDS SHE SAT AT THAT DESK SCRATCHING COMPOSEDLY WITH A HARD PEN SPEAKING IN THE SAME IMPERTURBABLE WHISPER TO EVERYBODY NEVER RELAXING A MUSCLE OF HER FACE OR SOFTENING A TONE OF HER VOICE OR APPEARING WITH AN ATOM OF HER DRESS ASTRAY HER BROTHER TOOK A BOOK SOMETIMES BUT NEVER READ IT THAT I SAW HE WOULD OPEN IT AND LOOK AT IT AS IF HE WERE READING BUT WOULD REMAIN FOR A WHOLE HOUR WITHOUT TURNING THE LEAF AND THEN PUT IT DOWN AND WALK TO AND FRO IN THE ROOM I USED TO SIT WITH FOLDED HANDS WATCHING HIM AND COUNTING HIS FOOTSTEPS HOUR AFTER HOUR HE VERY SELDOM SPOKE TO HER AND NEVER TO ME HE SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY RESTLESS THING EXCEPT THE CLOCKS IN THE WHOLE MOTIONLESS HOUSE IN THESE DAYS BEFORE THE FUNERAL I SAW BUT LITTLE OF PEGGOTTY EXCEPT THAT IN PASSING UP OR DOWN STAIRS I ALWAYS FOUND HER CLOSE TO THE ROOM WHERE MY MOTHER AND HER BABY LAY AND EXCEPT THAT SHE CAME TO ME EVERY NIGHT AND SAT BY MY BEDS HEAD WHILE I WENT TO SLEEP A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THE BURIALI THINK IT WAS A DAY OR TWO BEFORE BUT I AM CONSCIOUS OF CONFUSION IN MY MIND ABOUT THAT HEAVY TIME WITH NOTHING TO MARK ITS PROGRESSSHE TOOK ME INTO THE ROOM I ONLY RECOLLECT THAT UNDERNEATH SOME WHITE COVERING ON THE BED WITH A BEAUTIFUL CLEANLINESS AND FRESHNESS ALL AROUND IT THERE SEEMED TO ME TO LIE EMBODIED THE SOLEMN STILLNESS THAT WAS IN THE HOUSE AND THAT WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE TURNED THE COVER GENTLY BACK I CRIED OH NO OH NO AND HELD HER HAND IF THE FUNERAL HAD BEEN YESTERDAY I COULD NOT RECOLLECT IT BETTER THE VERY AIR OF THE BEST PARLOUR WHEN I WENT IN AT THE DOOR THE BRIGHT CONDITION OF THE FIRE THE SHINING OF THE WINE IN THE DECANTERS THE PATTERNS OF THE GLASSES AND PLATES THE FAINT SWEET SMELL OF CAKE THE ODOUR OF MISS MURDSTONES DRESS AND OUR BLACK CLOTHES MR CHILLIP IS IN THE ROOM AND COMES TO SPEAK TO ME AND HOW IS MASTER DAVID HE SAYS KINDLY I CANNOT TELL HIM VERY WELL I GIVE HIM MY HAND WHICH HE HOLDS IN HIS DEAR ME SAYS MR CHILLIP MEEKLY SMILING WITH SOMETHING SHINING IN HIS EYE OUR LITTLE FRIENDS GROW UP AROUND US THEY GROW OUT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE MAAM THIS IS TO MISS MURDSTONE WHO MAKES NO REPLY THERE IS A GREAT IMPROVEMENT HERE MAAM SAYS MR CHILLIP MISS MURDSTONE MERELY ANSWERS WITH A FROWN AND A FORMAL BEND MR CHILLIP DISCOMFITED GOES INTO A CORNER KEEPING ME WITH HIM AND OPENS HIS MOUTH NO MORE I REMARK

THE BEARERS AND THEIR LOAD ARE IN THE GARDEN AND THEY MOVE BEFORE US DOWN THE PATH AND PAST THE ELMS AND THROUGH THE GATE AND INTO THE CHURCHYARD WHERE I HAVE SO OFTEN HEARD THE BIRDS SING ON A SUMMER MORNING WE STAND AROUND THE GRAVE THE DAY SEEMS DIFFERENT TO ME FROM EVERY OTHER DAY AND THE LIGHT NOT OF THE SAME COLOUROF A SADDER COLOUR NOW THERE IS A SOLEMN HUSH WHICH WE HAVE BROUGHT FROM HOME WITH WHAT IS RESTING IN THE MOULD AND WHILE WE STAND BAREHEADED I HEAR THE VOICE OF THE CLERGYMAN SOUNDING REMOTE IN THE OPEN AIR AND YET DISTINCT AND PLAIN SAYING I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE SAITH THE LORD THEN I HEAR SOBS AND STANDING APART AMONG THE LOOKERSON I SEE THAT GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT WHOM OF ALL THE PEOPLE UPON EARTH I LOVE THE BEST AND UNTO WHOM MY CHILDISH HEART IS CERTAIN THAT THE LORD WILL ONE DAY SAY WELL DONE THERE ARE MANY FACES THAT I KNOW AMONG THE LITTLE CROWD FACES THAT I KNEW IN CHURCH WHEN MINE WAS ALWAYS WONDERING THERE FACES THAT FIRST SAW MY MOTHER WHEN SHE CAME TO THE VILLAGE IN HER YOUTHFUL BLOOM I DO NOT MIND THEMI MIND NOTHING BUT MY GRIEFAND YET I SEE AND KNOW THEM ALL AND EVEN IN THE BACKGROUND FAR AWAY SEE MINNIE LOOKING ON AND HER EYE GLANCING ON HER SWEETHEART WHO IS NEAR ME IT IS OVER AND THE EARTH IS FILLED IN AND WE TURN TO COME AWAY BEFORE US STANDS OUR HOUSE SO PRETTY AND UNCHANGED SO LINKED IN MY MIND WITH THE YOUNG IDEA OF WHAT IS GONE THAT ALL MY SORROW HAS BEEN NOTHING TO THE SORROW IT CALLS FORTH BUT THEY TAKE ME ON AND MR CHILLIP TALKS TO ME AND WHEN WE GET HOME PUTS SOME WATER TO MY LIPS AND WHEN I ASK HIS LEAVE TO GO UP TO MY ROOM DISMISSES ME WITH THE GENTLENESS OF A WOMAN ALL THIS I SAY IS YESTERDAYS EVENT EVENTS OF LATER DATE HAVE FLOATED FROM ME TO THE SHORE WHERE ALL FORGOTTEN THINGS WILL REAPPEAR BUT THIS STANDS LIKE A HIGH ROCK IN THE OCEAN I KNEW THAT PEGGOTTY WOULD COME TO ME IN MY ROOM THE SABBATH STILLNESS OF THE TIME THE DAY WAS SO LIKE SUNDAY I HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT WAS SUITED TO US BOTH SHE SAT DOWN BY MY SIDE UPON MY LITTLE BED AND HOLDING MY HAND AND SOMETIMES PUTTING IT TO HER LIPS AND SOMETIMES SMOOTHING IT WITH HERS AS SHE MIGHT HAVE COMFORTED MY LITTLE BROTHER TOLD ME IN HER WAY ALL THAT SHE HAD TO TELL CONCERNING WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE WAS NEVER WELL SAID PEGGOTTY FOR A LONG TIME SHE WAS UNCERTAIN IN HER MIND AND NOT HAPPY WHEN HER BABY WAS BORN I THOUGHT AT FIRST SHE WOULD GET BETTER BUT SHE WAS MORE DELICATE AND SUNK A LITTLE EVERY DAY SHE USED TO LIKE TO SIT ALONE BEFORE HER BABY CAME AND THEN SHE CRIED BUT AFTERWARDS SHE USED TO SING TO ITSO SOFT THAT I ONCE THOUGHT WHEN I HEARD HER IT WAS LIKE A VOICE UP IN THE AIR THAT WAS RISING AWAY I THINK SHE GOT TO BE MORE TIMID AND MORE FRIGHTENEDLIKE OF LATE AND THAT A HARD WORD WAS LIKE A BLOW TO HER BUT SHE WAS ALWAYS THE SAME TO ME SHE NEVER CHANGED TO HER FOOLISH PEGGOTTY DIDNT MY SWEET GIRL HERE PEGGOTTY STOPPED AND SOFTLY BEAT UPON MY HAND A LITTLE WHILE THE LAST TIME THAT I SAW HER LIKE HER OWN OLD SELF WAS THE NIGHT WHEN YOU CAME HOME MY DEAR THE DAY YOU WENT AWAY SHE SAID TO ME I NEVER SHALL SEE MY PRETTY DARLING AGAIN SOMETHING TELLS ME SO THAT TELLS THE TRUTH I KNOW SHE TRIED TO HOLD UP AFTER THAT AND MANY A TIME WHEN THEY TOLD HER SHE WAS THOUGHTLESS AND LIGHTHEARTED MADE BELIEVE TO BE SO BUT IT WAS ALL A BYGONE THEN SHE NEVER TOLD HER HUSBAND WHAT SHE HAD TOLD MESHE WAS AFRAID OF SAYING IT TO ANYBODY ELSETILL ONE NIGHT A LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK BEFORE IT HAPPENED WHEN SHE SAID TO HIM MY DEAR I THINK I AM DYING ITS OFF MY MIND NOW PEGGOTTY SHE TOLD ME WHEN I LAID HER IN HER BED THAT NIGHT HE WILL BELIEVE IT MORE AND MORE POOR FELLOW EVERY DAY FOR A FEW DAYS TO COME AND THEN IT WILL BE PAST I AM VERY TIRED IF THIS IS SLEEP SIT BY ME WHILE I SLEEP DONT LEAVE ME GOD BLESS BOTH MY CHILDREN GOD PROTECT AND KEEP MY FATHERLESS BOY I NEVER LEFT HER AFTERWARDS SAID PEGGOTTY SHE OFTEN TALKED TO THEM TWO DOWNSTAIRSFOR SHE LOVED THEM SHE COULDNT BEAR NOT TO LOVE ANYONE WHO WAS ABOUT HERBUT WHEN THEY WENT AWAY FROM HER BEDSIDE SHE ALWAYS TURNED TO ME AS IF THERE WAS REST WHERE PEGGOTTY WAS AND NEVER FELL ASLEEP IN ANY OTHER WAY ON THE LAST NIGHT IN THE EVENING SHE KISSED ME AND SAID IF MY BABY SHOULD DIE TOO PEGGOTTY PLEASE LET THEM LAY HIM IN MY ARMS AND BURY US TOGETHER IT WAS DONE FOR THE POOR LAMB LIVED BUT A DAY BEYOND HER LET MY DEAREST BOY GO WITH US TO OUR RESTINGPLACE SHE SAID AND TELL HIM THAT HIS MOTHER WHEN SHE LAY HERE BLESSED HIM NOT ONCE BUT A THOUSAND TIMES ANOTHER SILENCE FOLLOWED THIS AND ANOTHER GENTLE BEATING ON MY HAND IT WAS PRETTY FAR IN THE NIGHT SAID PEGGOTTY WHEN SHE ASKED ME FOR SOME DRINK AND WHEN SHE HAD TAKEN IT GAVE ME SUCH A PATIENT SMILE THE DEARSO BEAUTIFUL DAYBREAK HAD COME AND THE SUN WAS RISING WHEN SHE SAID TO ME HOW KIND AND CONSIDERATE MR COPPERFIELD HAD ALWAYS BEEN TO HER AND HOW HE HAD BORNE WITH HER AND TOLD HER WHEN SHE DOUBTED HERSELF THAT A LOVING HEART WAS BETTER AND STRONGER THAN WISDOM AND THAT HE WAS A HAPPY MAN IN HERS PEGGOTTY MY DEAR SHE SAID THEN PUT ME NEARER TO YOU FOR SHE WAS VERY WEAK LAY YOUR GOOD ARM UNDERNEATH MY NECK SHE SAID AND TURN ME TO YOU FOR YOUR FACE IS GOING FAR OFF AND I WANT IT TO BE NEAR I PUT IT AS SHE ASKED AND OH DAVY THE TIME HAD COME WHEN MY FIRST PARTING WORDS TO YOU WERE TRUEWHEN SHE WAS GLAD TO LAY HER POOR HEAD ON HER STUPID CROSS OLD PEGGOTTYS ARMAND SHE DIED LIKE A CHILD THAT HAD GONE TO SLEEP THUS ENDED PEGGOTTYS NARRATION FROM THE MOMENT OF MY KNOWING OF THE DEATH OF MY MOTHER THE IDEA OF HER AS SHE HAD BEEN OF LATE HAD VANISHED FROM ME I REMEMBERED HER FROM THAT INSTANT ONLY AS THE YOUNG MOTHER OF MY EARLIEST IMPRESSIONS WHO HAD BEEN USED TO WIND HER BRIGHT CURLS ROUND AND ROUND HER FINGER AND TO DANCE WITH ME AT TWILIGHT IN THE PARLOUR WHAT PEGGOTTY HAD TOLD ME NOW WAS SO FAR FROM BRINGING ME BACK TO THE LATER PERIOD THAT IT ROOTED THE EARLIER IMAGE IN MY MIND IT MAY BE CURIOUS BUT IT IS TRUE IN HER DEATH SHE WINGED HER WAY BACK TO HER CALM UNTROUBLED YOUTH AND CANCELLED ALL THE REST THE MOTHER WHO LAY IN THE GRAVE WAS THE MOTHER OF MY INFANCY THE LITTLE CREATURE IN HER ARMS WAS MYSELF AS I HAD ONCE BEEN HUSHED FOR EVER ON HER BOSOM CHAPTER I BECOME NEGLECTED AND AM PROVIDED FOR THE FIRST ACT OF BUSINESS MISS MURDSTONE PERFORMED WHEN THE DAY OF THE SOLEMNITY WAS OVER AND LIGHT WAS FREELY ADMITTED INTO THE HOUSE WAS TO GIVE PEGGOTTY A MONTHS WARNING MUCH AS PEGGOTTY WOULD HAVE DISLIKED SUCH A SERVICE I BELIEVE SHE WOULD HAVE RETAINED IT FOR MY SAKE IN PREFERENCE TO THE BEST UPON EARTH SHE TOLD ME WE MUST PART AND TOLD ME WHY AND WE CONDOLED WITH ONE ANOTHER IN ALL SINCERITY AS TO ME OR MY FUTURE NOT A WORD WAS SAID OR A STEP TAKEN HAPPY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN I DARE SAY IF THEY COULD HAVE DISMISSED ME AT A MONTHS WARNING TOO I MUSTERED COURAGE ONCE TO ASK MISS MURDSTONE WHEN I WAS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND SHE ANSWERED DRYLY SHE BELIEVED I WAS NOT GOING BACK AT ALL I WAS TOLD NOTHING MORE I WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO BE DONE WITH ME AND SO WAS PEGGOTTY BUT NEITHER SHE NOR I COULD PICK UP ANY INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT THERE WAS ONE CHANGE IN MY CONDITION WHICH WHILE IT RELIEVED ME OF A GREAT DEAL OF PRESENT UNEASINESS MIGHT HAVE MADE ME IF I HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF CONSIDERING IT CLOSELY YET MORE UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THE FUTURE IT WAS THIS THE CONSTRAINT THAT HAD BEEN PUT UPON ME WAS QUITE ABANDONED I WAS SO FAR FROM BEING REQUIRED TO KEEP MY DULL POST IN THE PARLOUR THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WHEN I TOOK MY SEAT THERE MISS MURDSTONE FROWNED TO ME TO GO AWAY I WAS SO FAR FROM BEING WARNED OFF FROM PEGGOTTYS SOCIETY THAT PROVIDED I WAS NOT IN MR MURDSTONES I WAS NEVER SOUGHT OUT OR INQUIRED FOR AT FIRST I WAS IN DAILY DREAD OF HIS TAKING MY EDUCATION IN HAND AGAIN OR OF MISS MURDSTONES DEVOTING HERSELF TO IT BUT I SOON BEGAN TO THINK THAT SUCH FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS AND THAT ALL I HAD TO ANTICIPATE WAS NEGLECT I DO NOT CONCEIVE THAT THIS DISCOVERY GAVE ME MUCH PAIN THEN I WAS STILL GIDDY WITH THE SHOCK OF MY MOTHERS DEATH AND IN A KIND OF STUNNED STATE AS TO ALL TRIBUTARY THINGS I CAN RECOLLECT INDEED TO HAVE SPECULATED AT ODD TIMES ON THE POSSIBILITY OF MY NOT BEING TAUGHT ANY MORE OR CARED FOR ANY MORE AND GROWING UP TO BE A SHABBY MOODY MAN LOUNGING AN IDLE LIFE AWAY ABOUT THE VILLAGE AS WELL AS ON THE FEASIBILITY OF MY GETTING RID OF THIS PICTURE BY GOING AWAY SOMEWHERE LIKE THE HERO IN A STORY TO SEEK MY FORTUNE BUT THESE WERE TRANSIENT VISIONS DAYDREAMS I SAT LOOKING AT SOMETIMES AS IF THEY WERE FAINTLY PAINTED OR WRITTEN ON THE WALL OF MY ROOM AND WHICH AS THEY MELTED AWAY LEFT THE WALL BLANK AGAIN PEGGOTTY I SAID IN A THOUGHTFUL WHISPER ONE EVENING WHEN I WAS WARMING MY HANDS AT THE KITCHEN FIRE MR MURDSTONE LIKES ME LESS THAN HE USED TO HE NEVER LIKED ME MUCH PEGGOTTY BUT HE WOULD RATHER NOT EVEN SEE ME NOW IF HE CAN HELP IT PERHAPS ITS HIS SORROW SAID PEGGOTTY STROKING MY HAIR I AM SURE PEGGOTTY I AM SORRY TOO IF I BELIEVED IT WAS HIS SORROW I SHOULD NOT THINK OF IT AT ALL BUT ITS NOT THAT OH NO ITS NOT THAT HOW DO YOU KNOW ITS NOT THAT SAID PEGGOTTY AFTER A SILENCE OH HIS SORROW IS ANOTHER AND QUITE A DIFFERENT THING HE IS SORRY AT THIS MOMENT SITTING BY THE FIRESIDE WITH MISS MURDSTONE BUT IF I WAS TO GO IN PEGGOTTY HE WOULD BE SOMETHING BESIDES WHAT WOULD HE BE SAID PEGGOTTY ANGRY I ANSWERED WITH AN INVOLUNTARY IMITATION OF HIS DARK FROWN IF HE WAS ONLY SORRY HE WOULDNT LOOK AT ME AS HE DOES I AM ONLY SORRY AND IT MAKES ME FEEL KINDER PEGGOTTY SAID NOTHING FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND I WARMED MY HANDS AS SILENT AS SHE DAVY SHE SAID AT LENGTH YES PEGGOTTY I HAVE TRIED MY DEAR ALL WAYS I COULD THINK OFALL THE WAYS THERE ARE AND ALL THE WAYS THERE AINT IN SHORTTO GET A SUITABLE SERVICE HERE IN BLUNDERSTONE BUT THERES NO SUCH A THING MY LOVE AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO PEGGOTTY SAYS I WISTFULLY DO YOU MEAN TO GO AND SEEK YOUR FORTUNE I EXPECT I SHALL BE FORCED TO GO TO YARMOUTH REPLIED PEGGOTTY AND LIVE THERE YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE FARTHER OFF I SAID BRIGHTENING A LITTLE AND BEEN AS BAD AS LOST I SHALL SEE YOU SOMETIMES MY DEAR OLD PEGGOTTY THERE YOU WONT BE QUITE AT THE OTHER END OF THE WORLD WILL YOU CONTRARY WAYS PLEASE GOD CRIED PEGGOTTY WITH GREAT ANIMATION AS LONG AS YOU ARE HERE MY PET I SHALL COME OVER EVERY WEEK OF MY LIFE TO SEE YOU ONE DAY EVERY WEEK OF MY LIFE I FELT A GREAT WEIGHT TAKEN OFF MY MIND BY THIS PROMISE BUT EVEN THIS WAS NOT ALL FOR PEGGOTTY WENT ON TO SAY IM AGOING DAVY YOU SEE TO MY BROTHERS FIRST FOR ANOTHER FORTNIGHTS VISITJUST TILL I HAVE HAD TIME TO LOOK ABOUT ME AND GET TO BE SOMETHING LIKE MYSELF AGAIN NOW I HAVE BEEN THINKING THAT PERHAPS AS THEY DONT WANT YOU HERE AT PRESENT YOU MIGHT BE LET TO GO ALONG WITH ME IF ANYTHING SHORT OF BEING IN A DIFFERENT RELATION TO EVERY ONE ABOUT ME PEGGOTTY EXCEPTED COULD HAVE GIVEN ME A SENSE OF PLEASURE AT THAT TIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THIS PROJECT OF ALL OTHERS THE IDEA OF BEING AGAIN SURROUNDED BY THOSE HONEST FACES SHINING WELCOME ON ME OF RENEWING THE PEACEFULNESS OF THE SWEET SUNDAY MORNING WHEN THE BELLS WERE RINGING THE STONES DROPPING IN THE WATER AND THE SHADOWY SHIPS BREAKING THROUGH THE MIST OF ROAMING UP AND DOWN WITH LITTLE EMLY TELLING HER MY TROUBLES AND FINDING CHARMS AGAINST THEM IN THE SHELLS AND PEBBLES ON THE BEACH MADE A CALM IN MY HEART IT WAS RUFFLED NEXT MOMENT TO BE SURE BY A DOUBT OF MISS MURDSTONES GIVING HER CONSENT BUT EVEN THAT WAS SET AT REST SOON FOR SHE CAME OUT TO TAKE AN EVENING GROPE IN THE STORECLOSET WHILE WE WERE YET IN CONVERSATION AND PEGGOTTY WITH A BOLDNESS THAT AMAZED ME BROACHED THE TOPIC ON THE SPOT THE BOY WILL BE IDLE THERE SAID MISS MURDSTONE LOOKING INTO A PICKLEJAR AND IDLENESS IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL BUT TO BE SURE HE WOULD BE IDLE HEREOR ANYWHERE IN MY OPINION PEGGOTTY HAD AN ANGRY ANSWER READY I COULD SEE BUT SHE SWALLOWED IT FOR MY SAKE AND REMAINED SILENT HUMPH SAID MISS MURDSTONE STILL KEEPING HER EYE ON THE PICKLES IT IS OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN ANYTHING ELSEIT IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCETHAT MY BROTHER SHOULD NOT BE DISTURBED OR MADE UNCOMFORTABLE I SUPPOSE I HAD BETTER SAY YES I THANKED HER WITHOUT MAKING ANY DEMONSTRATION OF JOY LEST IT SHOULD INDUCE HER TO WITHDRAW HER ASSENT NOR COULD I HELP THINKING THIS A PRUDENT COURSE SINCE SHE LOOKED AT ME OUT OF THE PICKLEJAR WITH AS GREAT AN ACCESS OF SOURNESS AS IF HER BLACK EYES HAD ABSORBED ITS CONTENTS HOWEVER THE PERMISSION WAS GIVEN AND WAS NEVER RETRACTED FOR WHEN THE MONTH WAS OUT PEGGOTTY AND I WERE READY TO DEPART MR BARKIS CAME INTO THE HOUSE FOR PEGGOTTYS BOXES I HAD NEVER KNOWN HIM TO PASS THE GARDENGATE BEFORE BUT ON THIS OCCASION HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE AND HE GAVE ME A LOOK AS HE SHOULDERED THE LARGEST BOX AND WENT OUT WHICH I THOUGHT HAD MEANING IN IT IF MEANING COULD EVER BE SAID TO FIND ITS WAY INTO MR BARKISS VISAGE PEGGOTTY WAS NATURALLY IN LOW SPIRITS AT LEAVING WHAT HAD BEEN HER HOME SO MANY YEARS AND WHERE THE TWO STRONG ATTACHMENTS OF HER LIFEFOR MY MOTHER AND MYSELFHAD BEEN FORMED SHE HAD BEEN WALKING IN THE CHURCHYARD TOO VERY EARLY AND SHE GOT INTO THE CART AND SAT IN IT WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF AT HER EYES SO LONG AS SHE REMAINED IN THIS CONDITION MR BARKIS GAVE NO SIGN OF LIFE WHATEVER HE SAT IN HIS USUAL PLACE AND ATTITUDE LIKE A GREAT STUFFED FIGURE BUT WHEN SHE BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT HER AND TO SPEAK TO ME HE NODDED HIS HEAD AND GRINNED SEVERAL TIMES I HAVE NOT THE LEAST NOTION AT WHOM OR WHAT HE MEANT BY IT ITS A BEAUTIFUL DAY MR BARKIS I SAID AS AN ACT OF POLITENESS IT AINT BAD SAID MR BARKIS WHO GENERALLY QUALIFIED HIS SPEECH AND RARELY COMMITTED HIMSELF PEGGOTTY IS QUITE COMFORTABLE NOW MR BARKIS I REMARKED FOR HIS SATISFACTION IS SHE THOUGH SAID MR BARKIS AFTER REFLECTING ABOUT IT WITH A SAGACIOUS AIR MR BARKIS EYED HER AND SAID ARE YOU PRETTY COMFORTABLE PEGGOTTY LAUGHED AND ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE BUT REALLY AND TRULY YOU KNOW ARE YOU GROWLED MR BARKIS SLIDING NEARER TO HER ON THE SEAT AND NUDGING HER WITH HIS ELBOW ARE YOU REALLY AND TRULY PRETTY COMFORTABLE ARE YOU EH AT EACH OF THESE INQUIRIES MR BARKIS SHUFFLED NEARER TO HER AND GAVE HER ANOTHER NUDGE SO THAT AT LAST WE WERE ALL CROWDED TOGETHER IN THE LEFTHAND CORNER OF THE CART AND I WAS SO SQUEEZED THAT I COULD HARDLY BEAR IT PEGGOTTY CALLING HIS ATTENTION TO MY SUFFERINGS MR BARKIS GAVE ME A LITTLE MORE ROOM AT ONCE AND GOT AWAY BY DEGREES BUT I COULD NOT HELP OBSERVING THAT HE SEEMED TO THINK HE HAD HIT UPON A WONDERFUL EXPEDIENT FOR EXPRESSING HIMSELF IN A NEAT AGREEABLE AND POINTED MANNER WITHOUT THE INCONVENIENCE OF INVENTING CONVERSATION HE MANIFESTLY CHUCKLED OVER IT FOR SOME TIME BY AND BY HE TURNED TO PEGGOTTY AGAIN AND REPEATING ARE YOU PRETTY COMFORTABLE THOUGH BORE DOWN UPON US AS BEFORE UNTIL THE BREATH WAS NEARLY EDGED OUT OF MY BODY BY AND BY HE MADE ANOTHER DESCENT UPON US WITH THE SAME INQUIRY AND THE SAME RESULT AT LENGTH I GOT UP WHENEVER I SAW HIM COMING AND STANDING ON THE FOOTBOARD PRETENDED TO LOOK AT THE PROSPECT AFTER WHICH I DID VERY WELL HE WAS SO POLITE AS TO STOP AT A PUBLICHOUSE EXPRESSLY ON OUR ACCOUNT AND ENTERTAIN US WITH BROILED MUTTON AND BEER EVEN WHEN PEGGOTTY WAS IN THE ACT OF DRINKING HE WAS SEIZED WITH ONE OF THOSE APPROACHES AND ALMOST CHOKED HER BUT AS WE DREW NEARER TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEY HE HAD MORE TO DO AND LESS TIME FOR GALLANTRY AND WHEN WE GOT ON YARMOUTH PAVEMENT WE WERE ALL TOO MUCH SHAKEN AND JOLTED I APPREHEND TO HAVE ANY LEISURE FOR ANYTHING ELSE MR PEGGOTTY AND HAM WAITED FOR US AT THE OLD PLACE THEY RECEIVED ME AND PEGGOTTY IN AN AFFECTIONATE MANNER AND SHOOK HANDS WITH MR BARKIS WHO WITH HIS HAT ON THE VERY BACK OF HIS HEAD AND A SHAMEFACED LEER UPON HIS COUNTENANCE AND PERVADING HIS VERY LEGS PRESENTED BUT A VACANT APPEARANCE I THOUGHT THEY EACH TOOK ONE OF PEGGOTTYS TRUNKS AND WE WERE GOING AWAY WHEN MR BARKIS SOLEMNLY MADE A SIGN TO ME WITH HIS FOREFINGER TO COME UNDER AN ARCHWAY I SAY GROWLED MR BARKIS IT WAS ALL RIGHT I LOOKED UP INTO HIS FACE AND ANSWERED WITH AN ATTEMPT TO BE VERY PROFOUND OH IT DIDNT COME TO A END THERE SAID MR BARKIS NODDING CONFIDENTIALLY IT WAS ALL RIGHT AGAIN I ANSWERED OH YOU KNOW WHO WAS WILLIN SAID MY FRIEND IT WAS BARKIS AND BARKIS ONLY I NODDED ASSENT ITS ALL RIGHT SAID MR BARKIS SHAKING HANDS IM A FRIEND OF YOURN YOU MADE IT ALL RIGHT FIRST ITS ALL RIGHT IN HIS ATTEMPTS TO BE PARTICULARLY LUCID MR BARKIS WAS SO EXTREMELY MYSTERIOUS THAT I MIGHT HAVE STOOD LOOKING IN HIS FACE FOR AN HOUR AND MOST ASSUREDLY SHOULD HAVE GOT AS MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF IT AS OUT OF THE FACE OF A CLOCK THAT HAD STOPPED BUT FOR PEGGOTTYS CALLING ME AWAY AS WE WERE GOING ALONG SHE ASKED ME WHAT HE HAD SAID AND I TOLD HER HE HAD SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT LIKE HIS IMPUDENCE SAID PEGGOTTY BUT I DONT MIND THAT DAVY DEAR WHAT SHOULD YOU THINK IF I WAS TO THINK OF BEING MARRIED WHYI SUPPOSE YOU WOULD LIKE ME AS MUCH THEN PEGGOTTY AS YOU DO NOW I RETURNED AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION GREATLY TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE PASSENGERS IN THE STREET AS WELL AS OF HER RELATIONS GOING ON BEFORE THE GOOD SOUL WAS OBLIGED TO STOP AND EMBRACE ME ON THE SPOT WITH MANY PROTESTATIONS OF HER UNALTERABLE LOVE TELL ME WHAT SHOULD YOU SAY DARLING SHE ASKED AGAIN WHEN THIS WAS OVER AND WE WERE WALKING ON IF YOU WERE THINKING OF BEING MARRIEDTO MR BARKIS PEGGOTTY YES SAID PEGGOTTY I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR THEN YOU KNOW

COMFORTABLE SAID PEGGOTTY LAUGHING HEARTILY THIS QUOTATION FROM MR BARKIS WAS SO APPROPRIATE AND TICKLED US BOTH SO MUCH THAT WE LAUGHED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND WERE QUITE IN A PLEASANT HUMOUR WHEN WE CAME WITHIN VIEW OF MR PEGGOTTYS COTTAGE IT LOOKED JUST THE SAME EXCEPT THAT IT MAY PERHAPS HAVE SHRUNK A LITTLE IN MY EYES AND MRS GUMMIDGE WAS WAITING AT THE DOOR AS IF SHE HAD STOOD THERE EVER SINCE ALL WITHIN WAS THE SAME DOWN TO THE SEAWEED IN THE BLUE MUG IN MY BEDROOM I WENT INTO THE OUTHOUSE TO LOOK ABOUT ME AND THE VERY SAME LOBSTERS CRABS AND CRAWFISH POSSESSED BY THE SAME DESIRE TO PINCH THE WORLD IN GENERAL APPEARED TO BE IN THE SAME STATE OF CONGLOMERATION IN THE SAME OLD CORNER BUT THERE WAS NO LITTLE EMLY TO BE SEEN SO I ASKED MR PEGGOTTY WHERE SHE WAS SHES AT SCHOOL SIR

DIDNT GO CONTRARY WITH ME MRS GUMMIDGE WHIMPERING AND SHAKING HER HEAD APPLIED HERSELF TO BLOWING THE FIRE MR PEGGOTTY LOOKING ROUND UPON US WHILE SHE WAS SO ENGAGED SAID IN A LOW VOICE WHICH HE SHADED WITH HIS HAND THE OLD UN FROM THIS I RIGHTLY CONJECTURED THAT NO IMPROVEMENT HAD TAKEN PLACE SINCE MY LAST VISIT IN THE STATE OF MRS GUMMIDGES SPIRITS NOW THE WHOLE PLACE WAS OR IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AS DELIGHTFUL A PLACE AS EVER AND YET IT DID NOT IMPRESS ME IN THE SAME WAY I FELT RATHER DISAPPOINTED WITH IT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE LITTLE EMLY WAS NOT AT HOME I KNEW THE WAY BY WHICH SHE WOULD COME AND PRESENTLY FOUND MYSELF STROLLING ALONG THE PATH TO MEET HER A FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE BEFORE LONG AND I SOON KNEW IT TO BE EMLY WHO WAS A LITTLE CREATURE STILL IN STATURE THOUGH SHE WAS GROWN BUT WHEN SHE DREW NEARER AND I SAW HER BLUE EYES LOOKING BLUER AND HER DIMPLED FACE LOOKING BRIGHTER AND HER WHOLE SELF PRETTIER AND GAYER A CURIOUS FEELING CAME OVER ME THAT MADE ME PRETEND NOT TO KNOW HER AND PASS BY AS IF I WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING A LONG WAY OFF I HAVE DONE SUCH A THING SINCE IN LATER LIFE OR I AM MISTAKEN LITTLE EMLY DIDNT CARE A BIT SHE SAW ME WELL ENOUGH BUT INSTEAD OF TURNING ROUND AND CALLING AFTER ME RAN AWAY LAUGHING THIS OBLIGED ME TO RUN AFTER HER AND SHE RAN SO FAST THAT WE WERE VERY NEAR THE COTTAGE BEFORE I CAUGHT HER OH ITS YOU IS IT SAID

NOTHING BUT LAUGH A LITTLE PUSS IT IS SAID MR PEGGOTTY PATTING HER WITH HIS GREAT HAND SO SH IS SO SH IS CRIED HAM MASR DAVY BOR SO SH IS AND HE SAT AND CHUCKLED AT HER FOR SOME TIME IN A STATE OF MINGLED ADMIRATION AND DELIGHT THAT MADE HIS FACE A BURNING RED LITTLE EMLY WAS SPOILED BY THEM ALL IN FACT AND BY NO ONE MORE THAN MR PEGGOTTY HIMSELF WHOM SHE COULD HAVE COAXED INTO ANYTHING BY ONLY GOING AND LAYING HER CHEEK AGAINST HIS ROUGH WHISKER THAT WAS MY OPINION AT LEAST WHEN I SAW HER DO IT AND I HELD MR PEGGOTTY TO BE THOROUGHLY IN THE RIGHT BUT SHE WAS SO AFFECTIONATE AND SWEETNATURED AND HAD SUCH A PLEASANT MANNER OF BEING BOTH SLY AND SHY AT ONCE THAT SHE CAPTIVATED ME MORE THAN EVER SHE WAS TENDERHEARTED TOO FOR WHEN AS WE SAT ROUND THE FIRE AFTER TEA AN ALLUSION WAS MADE BY MR

INDEED WHEN MY EYES RESTED ON LITTLE EMLYS FACE WHICH WAS BENT FORWARD OVER THE TABLE LISTENING WITH THE DEEPEST ATTENTION HER BREATH HELD HER BLUE EYES SPARKLING LIKE JEWELS AND THE COLOUR MANTLING IN HER CHEEKS SHE LOOKED SO EXTRAORDINARILY EARNEST AND PRETTY THAT I STOPPED IN A SORT OF WONDER AND THEY ALL OBSERVED HER AT THE SAME TIME FOR AS I STOPPED THEY LAUGHED AND LOOKED AT HER EMLY IS LIKE ME SAID PEGGOTTY AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM EMLY WAS CONFUSED BY OUR ALL OBSERVING HER AND HUNG DOWN HER HEAD AND HER FACE WAS COVERED WITH BLUSHES GLANCING UP PRESENTLY THROUGH HER STRAY CURLS AND SEEING THAT WE WERE ALL LOOKING AT HER STILL I AM SURE I FOR ONE COULD HAVE LOOKED AT HER FOR HOURS SHE RAN AWAY AND KEPT AWAY TILL IT WAS NEARLY BEDTIME I LAY DOWN IN THE OLD LITTLE BED IN THE STERN OF THE BOAT AND THE WIND CAME MOANING ON ACROSS THE FLAT AS IT HAD DONE BEFORE BUT I COULD NOT HELP FANCYING NOW THAT IT MOANED OF THOSE WHO WERE GONE AND INSTEAD OF THINKING THAT THE SEA MIGHT RISE IN THE NIGHT AND FLOAT THE BOAT AWAY I THOUGHT OF THE SEA THAT HAD RISEN SINCE I LAST HEARD THOSE SOUNDS AND DROWNED MY HAPPY HOME I RECOLLECT AS THE WIND AND WATER BEGAN TO SOUND FAINTER IN MY EARS PUTTING A SHORT CLAUSE INTO MY PRAYERS PETITIONING THAT I MIGHT GROW UP TO MARRY LITTLE EMLY AND SO DROPPING LOVINGLY ASLEEP THE DAYS PASSED PRETTY MUCH AS THEY HAD PASSED BEFORE EXCEPTIT WAS A GREAT EXCEPTIONTHAT LITTLE EMLY AND I SELDOM WANDERED ON THE BEACH NOW SHE HAD TASKS TO LEARN AND NEEDLEWORK TO DO AND WAS ABSENT DURING A GREAT PART OF EACH DAY BUT I FELT THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD THOSE OLD WANDERINGS EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN OTHERWISE WILD AND FULL OF CHILDISH WHIMS AS EMLY WAS SHE WAS MORE OF A LITTLE WOMAN THAN I HAD SUPPOSED SHE SEEMED TO HAVE GOT A GREAT DISTANCE AWAY FROM ME IN LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR SHE LIKED ME BUT SHE LAUGHED AT ME AND TORMENTED ME AND WHEN I WENT TO MEET HER STOLE HOME ANOTHER WAY AND WAS LAUGHING AT THE DOOR WHEN I CAME BACK DISAPPOINTED THE BEST TIMES WERE WHEN SHE SAT QUIETLY AT WORK IN THE DOORWAY AND I SAT ON THE WOODEN STEP AT HER FEET READING TO HER IT SEEMS TO ME AT THIS HOUR THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH SUNLIGHT AS ON THOSE BRIGHT APRIL AFTERNOONS THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A SUNNY LITTLE FIGURE AS I USED TO SEE SITTING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE OLD BOAT THAT I HAVE NEVER BEHELD SUCH SKY SUCH WATER SUCH GLORIFIED SHIPS SAILING AWAY INTO GOLDEN AIR ON THE VERY FIRST EVENING AFTER OUR ARRIVAL MR BARKIS APPEARED IN AN EXCEEDINGLY VACANT AND AWKWARD CONDITION AND WITH A BUNDLE OF ORANGES TIED UP IN A HANDKERCHIEF AS HE MADE NO ALLUSION OF ANY KIND TO THIS PROPERTY HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE LEFT IT BEHIND HIM BY ACCIDENT WHEN HE WENT AWAY UNTIL HAM RUNNING AFTER HIM TO RESTORE IT CAME BACK WITH THE INFORMATION THAT IT WAS INTENDED FOR PEGGOTTY AFTER THAT OCCASION HE APPEARED EVERY EVENING AT EXACTLY THE SAME HOUR AND ALWAYS WITH A LITTLE BUNDLE TO WHICH HE NEVER ALLUDED AND WHICH HE REGULARLY PUT BEHIND THE DOOR AND LEFT THERE THESE OFFERINGS OF AFFECTION WERE OF A MOST VARIOUS AND ECCENTRIC DESCRIPTION AMONG THEM I REMEMBER A DOUBLE SET OF PIGS TROTTERS A HUGE PINCUSHION HALF A BUSHEL OR SO OF APPLES A PAIR OF JET EARRINGS SOME SPANISH ONIONS A BOX OF DOMINOES A CANARY BIRD AND CAGE AND A LEG OF PICKLED PORK MR BARKISS WOOING AS I REMEMBER IT WAS ALTOGETHER OF A PECULIAR KIND HE VERY SELDOM SAID ANYTHING BUT WOULD SIT BY THE FIRE IN MUCH THE SAME ATTITUDE AS HE SAT IN HIS CART AND STARE HEAVILY AT PEGGOTTY WHO WAS OPPOSITE ONE NIGHT BEING AS I SUPPOSE INSPIRED BY LOVE HE MADE A DART AT THE BIT OF WAXCANDLE SHE KEPT FOR HER THREAD AND PUT IT IN HIS WAISTCOATPOCKET AND CARRIED IT OFF AFTER THAT HIS GREAT DELIGHT WAS TO PRODUCE IT WHEN IT WAS WANTED STICKING TO THE LINING OF HIS POCKET IN A PARTIALLY MELTED STATE AND POCKET IT AGAIN WHEN IT WAS DONE WITH HE SEEMED TO ENJOY HIMSELF VERY MUCH AND NOT TO FEEL AT ALL CALLED UPON TO TALK EVEN WHEN HE TOOK PEGGOTTY OUT FOR A WALK ON THE FLATS HE HAD NO UNEASINESS ON THAT HEAD I BELIEVE CONTENTING HIMSELF WITH NOW AND THEN ASKING HER IF SHE WAS PRETTY COMFORTABLE AND I REMEMBER THAT SOMETIMES AFTER HE WAS GONE PEGGOTTY WOULD THROW HER APRON OVER HER FACE AND LAUGH FOR HALFANHOUR INDEED WE WERE ALL MORE OR LESS AMUSED EXCEPT THAT MISERABLE MRS GUMMIDGE WHOSE COURTSHIP WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN OF AN EXACTLY PARALLEL NATURE SHE WAS SO CONTINUALLY REMINDED BY THESE TRANSACTIONS OF THE OLD ONE AT LENGTH WHEN THE TERM OF MY VISIT WAS NEARLY EXPIRED IT WAS GIVEN OUT THAT PEGGOTTY AND MR BARKIS WERE GOING TO MAKE A DAYS HOLIDAY TOGETHER AND THAT LITTLE EMLY AND I WERE TO ACCOMPANY THEM I HAD BUT A BROKEN SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE IN ANTICIPATION OF THE PLEASURE OF A WHOLE DAY WITH EMLY WE WERE ALL ASTIR BETIMES IN THE MORNING AND WHILE WE WERE YET AT BREAKFAST MR BARKIS APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE DRIVING A CHAISECART TOWARDS THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTIONS PEGGOTTY WAS DRESSED AS USUAL IN HER NEAT AND QUIET MOURNING BUT MR BARKIS BLOOMED IN A NEW BLUE COAT OF WHICH THE TAILOR HAD GIVEN HIM SUCH GOOD MEASURE THAT THE CUFFS WOULD HAVE RENDERED GLOVES UNNECESSARY IN THE COLDEST WEATHER WHILE THE COLLAR WAS SO HIGH THAT IT PUSHED HIS HAIR UP ON END ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD HIS BRIGHT BUTTONS TOO WERE OF THE LARGEST SIZE RENDERED COMPLETE BY DRAB PANTALOONS AND A BUFF WAISTCOAT I THOUGHT MR BARKIS A PHENOMENON OF RESPECTABILITY WHEN WE WERE ALL IN A BUSTLE OUTSIDE THE DOOR I FOUND THAT MR PEGGOTTY WAS PREPARED WITH AN OLD SHOE WHICH WAS TO BE THROWN AFTER US FOR LUCK AND WHICH HE OFFERED TO MRS GUMMIDGE FOR THAT PURPOSE NO IT HAD BETTER BE DONE BY SOMEBODY ELSE DANL SAID MRS GUMMIDGE IM A LONE LORN CREETUR MYSELF AND EVERYTHINK THAT REMINDS ME OF CREETURS THAT AINT LONE AND LORN GOES CONTRARY WITH ME COME OLD GAL CRIED MR PEGGOTTY TAKE AND HEAVE IT NO DANL RETURNED MRS GUMMIDGE WHIMPERING AND SHAKING HER HEAD IF I FELT LESS I COULD DO MORE YOU DONT FEEL LIKE ME DANL THINKS DONT GO CONTRARY WITH YOU NOR YOU WITH THEM YOU HAD BETTER DO IT YOURSELF BUT HERE PEGGOTTY WHO HAD BEEN GOING ABOUT FROM ONE TO ANOTHER IN A HURRIED WAY KISSING EVERYBODY CALLED OUT FROM THE CART IN WHICH WE ALL WERE BY THIS TIME EMLY AND I ON TWO LITTLE CHAIRS SIDE BY SIDE THAT MRS GUMMIDGE MUST DO IT SO MRS GUMMIDGE DID IT AND I AM SORRY TO RELATE CAST A DAMP UPON THE FESTIVE CHARACTER OF OUR DEPARTURE BY IMMEDIATELY BURSTING INTO TEARS AND SINKING SUBDUED INTO THE ARMS OF HAM WITH THE DECLARATION THAT SHE KNOWED SHE WAS A BURDEN AND HAD BETTER BE CARRIED TO THE HOUSE AT ONCE WHICH I REALLY THOUGHT WAS A SENSIBLE IDEA THAT HAM MIGHT HAVE ACTED ON AWAY WE WENT HOWEVER ON OUR HOLIDAY EXCURSION AND THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS TO STOP AT A CHURCH WHERE MR BARKIS TIED THE HORSE TO SOME RAILS AND WENT IN WITH PEGGOTTY LEAVING LITTLE EMLY AND ME ALONE IN THE CHAISE I TOOK THAT OCCASION TO PUT MY ARM ROUND EMLYS WAIST AND PROPOSE THAT AS I WAS GOING AWAY SO VERY SOON NOW WE SHOULD DETERMINE TO BE VERY AFFECTIONATE TO ONE ANOTHER AND VERY HAPPY ALL DAY LITTLE EMLY CONSENTING AND ALLOWING ME TO KISS HER I BECAME DESPERATE INFORMING HER I RECOLLECT THAT I NEVER COULD LOVE ANOTHER AND THAT I WAS PREPARED TO SHED THE BLOOD OF ANYBODY WHO SHOULD ASPIRE TO HER AFFECTIONS HOW MERRY LITTLE EMLY MADE HERSELF ABOUT IT WITH WHAT A DEMURE ASSUMPTION OF BEING IMMENSELY OLDER AND WISER THAN I THE FAIRY LITTLE WOMAN SAID I WAS A SILLY BOY AND THEN LAUGHED SO CHARMINGLY THAT I FORGOT THE PAIN OF BEING CALLED BY THAT DISPARAGING NAME IN THE PLEASURE OF LOOKING AT HER MR BARKIS AND PEGGOTTY WERE A GOOD WHILE IN THE CHURCH BUT CAME OUT AT LAST AND THEN WE DROVE AWAY INTO THE COUNTRY AS WE WERE GOING ALONG MR BARKIS TURNED TO ME AND SAID WITH A WINKBY THE BY I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE THOUGHT BEFORE THAT HE COULD WINK WHAT NAME WAS IT AS I WROTE UP IN THE CART CLARA PEGGOTTY I ANSWERED WHAT NAME WOULD IT BE AS I SHOULD WRITE UP NOW IF THERE WAS A TILT HERE CLARA PEGGOTTY AGAIN I SUGGESTED CLARA PEGGOTTY BARKIS HE RETURNED AND BURST INTO A ROAR OF LAUGHTER THAT SHOOK THE CHAISE IN A WORD THEY WERE MARRIED AND HAD GONE INTO THE CHURCH FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE PEGGOTTY WAS RESOLVED THAT IT SHOULD BE QUIETLY DONE AND THE CLERK HAD GIVEN HER AWAY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO WITNESSES OF THE CEREMONY SHE WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED WHEN MR BARKIS MADE THIS ABRUPT ANNOUNCEMENT OF THEIR UNION AND COULD NOT HUG ME ENOUGH IN TOKEN OF HER UNIMPAIRED AFFECTION BUT SHE SOON BECAME HERSELF AGAIN AND SAID SHE WAS VERY GLAD IT WAS OVER WE DROVE TO A LITTLE INN IN A BYROAD WHERE WE WERE EXPECTED AND WHERE WE HAD A VERY COMFORTABLE DINNER AND PASSED THE DAY WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IF PEGGOTTY HAD BEEN MARRIED EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS SHE COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN MORE AT HER EASE ABOUT IT IT MADE NO SORT OF DIFFERENCE IN HER SHE WAS JUST THE SAME AS EVER AND WENT OUT FOR A STROLL WITH LITTLE EMLY AND ME BEFORE TEA WHILE MR BARKIS PHILOSOPHICALLY SMOKED HIS PIPE AND ENJOYED HIMSELF I SUPPOSE WITH THE CONTEMPLATION OF HIS HAPPINESS IF SO IT SHARPENED HIS APPETITE FOR I DISTINCTLY CALL TO MIND THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAD EATEN A GOOD DEAL OF PORK AND GREENS AT DINNER AND HAD FINISHED OFF WITH A FOWL OR TWO HE WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE COLD BOILED BACON FOR TEA AND DISPOSED OF A LARGE QUANTITY WITHOUT ANY EMOTION I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT SINCE WHAT AN ODD INNOCENT OUTOFTHEWAY KIND OF WEDDING IT MUST HAVE BEEN WE GOT INTO THE CHAISE AGAIN SOON AFTER DARK AND DROVE COSILY BACK LOOKING UP AT THE STARS AND TALKING ABOUT THEM I WAS THEIR CHIEF EXPONENT AND OPENED MR BARKISS MIND TO AN AMAZING EXTENT I TOLD HIM ALL I KNEW BUT HE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED ANYTHING I MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IT INTO MY HEAD TO IMPART TO HIM FOR HE HAD A PROFOUND VENERATION FOR MY ABILITIES AND INFORMED HIS WIFE IN MY HEARING ON THAT VERY OCCASION THAT I WAS A YOUNG ROESHUSBY WHICH I THINK HE MEANT PRODIGY WHEN WE HAD EXHAUSTED THE SUBJECT OF THE STARS OR RATHER WHEN I HAD EXHAUSTED THE MENTAL FACULTIES OF MR BARKIS LITTLE EMLY AND I MADE A CLOAK OF AN OLD WRAPPER AND SAT UNDER IT FOR THE REST OF THE JOURNEY AH HOW I LOVED HER WHAT HAPPINESS I THOUGHT IF WE WERE MARRIED AND WERE GOING AWAY ANYWHERE TO LIVE AMONG THE TREES AND IN THE FIELDS NEVER GROWING OLDER NEVER GROWING WISER CHILDREN EVER RAMBLING HAND IN HAND THROUGH SUNSHINE AND AMONG FLOWERY MEADOWS LAYING DOWN OUR HEADS ON MOSS AT NIGHT IN A SWEET SLEEP OF PURITY AND PEACE AND BURIED BY THE BIRDS WHEN WE WERE DEAD SOME SUCH PICTURE WITH NO REAL WORLD IN IT BRIGHT WITH THE LIGHT OF OUR INNOCENCE AND VAGUE AS THE STARS AFAR OFF WAS IN MY MIND ALL THE WAY I AM GLAD TO THINK THERE WERE TWO SUCH GUILELESS HEARTS AT PEGGOTTYS MARRIAGE AS LITTLE EMLYS AND MINE I AM GLAD TO THINK THE LOVES AND GRACES TOOK SUCH AIRY FORMS IN ITS HOMELY PROCESSION WELL WE CAME TO THE OLD BOAT AGAIN IN GOOD TIME AT NIGHT AND THERE MR AND MRS BARKIS BADE US GOODBYE AND DROVE AWAY SNUGLY TO THEIR OWN HOME I FELT THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAD LOST PEGGOTTY I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO BED WITH A SORE HEART INDEED UNDER ANY OTHER ROOF BUT THAT WHICH SHELTERED LITTLE EMLYS HEAD MR PEGGOTTY AND HAM KNEW WHAT WAS IN MY THOUGHTS AS WELL AS I DID AND WERE READY WITH SOME SUPPER AND THEIR HOSPITABLE FACES TO DRIVE IT AWAY LITTLE EMLY CAME AND SAT BESIDE ME ON THE LOCKER FOR THE ONLY TIME IN ALL THAT VISIT AND IT WAS ALTOGETHER A WONDERFUL CLOSE TO A WONDERFUL DAY IT WAS A NIGHT TIDE AND SOON AFTER WE WENT TO BED MR PEGGOTTY AND HAM WENT OUT TO FISH I FELT VERY BRAVE AT BEING LEFT ALONE IN THE SOLITARY HOUSE THE PROTECTOR OF EMLY AND MRS GUMMIDGE AND ONLY WISHED THAT A LION OR A SERPENT OR ANY ILLDISPOSED MONSTER WOULD MAKE AN ATTACK UPON US THAT I MIGHT DESTROY HIM AND COVER MYSELF WITH GLORY BUT AS NOTHING OF THE SORT HAPPENED TO BE WALKING ABOUT ON YARMOUTH FLATS THAT NIGHT I PROVIDED THE BEST SUBSTITUTE I COULD BY DREAMING OF DRAGONS UNTIL MORNING WITH MORNING CAME PEGGOTTY WHO CALLED TO ME AS USUAL UNDER MY WINDOW AS IF MR BARKIS THE CARRIER HAD BEEN FROM FIRST TO LAST A DREAM TOO AFTER BREAKFAST SHE TOOK ME TO HER OWN HOME AND A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE HOME IT WAS OF ALL THE MOVEABLES IN IT I MUST HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED BY A CERTAIN OLD BUREAU OF SOME DARK WOOD IN THE PARLOUR THE TILEFLOORED KITCHEN WAS THE GENERAL SITTINGROOM WITH A RETREATING TOP WHICH OPENED LET DOWN AND BECAME A DESK WITHIN WHICH WAS A LARGE QUARTO EDITION OF FOXES BOOK OF MARTYRS THIS PRECIOUS VOLUME OF WHICH I DO NOT RECOLLECT ONE WORD I IMMEDIATELY DISCOVERED AND IMMEDIATELY APPLIED MYSELF TO AND I NEVER VISITED THE HOUSE AFTERWARDS BUT I KNEELED ON A CHAIR OPENED THE CASKET WHERE THIS GEM WAS ENSHRINED SPREAD MY ARMS OVER THE DESK AND FELL TO DEVOURING THE BOOK AFRESH I WAS CHIEFLY EDIFIED I AM AFRAID BY THE PICTURES WHICH WERE NUMEROUS AND REPRESENTED ALL KINDS OF DISMAL HORRORS BUT THE MARTYRS AND PEGGOTTYS HOUSE HAVE BEEN INSEPARABLE IN MY MIND EVER SINCE AND ARE NOW I TOOK LEAVE OF MR PEGGOTTY AND HAM AND MRS GUMMIDGE AND LITTLE EMLY THAT DAY AND PASSED THE NIGHT AT PEGGOTTYS IN A LITTLE ROOM IN THE ROOF WITH THE CROCODILE BOOK ON A SHELF BY THE BEDS HEAD WHICH WAS TO BE ALWAYS MINE PEGGOTTY SAID AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE KEPT FOR ME IN EXACTLY THE SAME STATE YOUNG OR OLD DAVY DEAR AS LONG AS I AM ALIVE AND HAVE THIS HOUSE OVER MY HEAD SAID PEGGOTTY YOU SHALL FIND IT AS IF I EXPECTED YOU HERE DIRECTLY MINUTE I SHALL KEEP IT EVERY DAY AS I USED TO KEEP YOUR OLD LITTLE ROOM MY DARLING AND IF YOU WAS TO GO TO CHINA YOU MIGHT THINK OF IT AS BEING KEPT JUST THE SAME ALL THE TIME YOU WERE AWAY I FELT THE TRUTH AND CONSTANCY OF MY DEAR OLD NURSE WITH ALL MY HEART AND THANKED HER AS WELL AS I COULD THAT WAS NOT VERY WELL FOR SHE SPOKE TO ME THUS WITH HER ARMS ROUND MY NECK IN THE MORNING AND I WAS GOING HOME IN THE MORNING AND I WENT HOME IN THE MORNING WITH HERSELF AND MR BARKIS IN THE CART THEY LEFT ME AT THE GATE NOT EASILY OR LIGHTLY AND IT WAS A STRANGE SIGHT TO ME TO SEE THE CART GO ON TAKING PEGGOTTY AWAY AND LEAVING ME UNDER THE OLD ELMTREES LOOKING AT THE HOUSE IN WHICH THERE WAS NO FACE TO LOOK ON MINE WITH LOVE OR LIKING ANY MORE AND NOW I FELL INTO A STATE OF NEGLECT WHICH I CANNOT LOOK BACK UPON WITHOUT COMPASSION I FELL AT ONCE INTO A SOLITARY CONDITIONAPART FROM ALL FRIENDLY NOTICE APART FROM THE SOCIETY OF ALL OTHER BOYS OF MY OWN AGE APART FROM ALL COMPANIONSHIP BUT MY OWN SPIRITLESS THOUGHTSWHICH SEEMS TO CAST ITS GLOOM UPON THIS PAPER AS I WRITE WHAT WOULD I HAVE GIVEN TO HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE HARDEST SCHOOL THAT EVER WAS KEPTTO HAVE BEEN TAUGHT SOMETHING ANYHOW ANYWHERE NO SUCH HOPE DAWNED UPON ME THEY DISLIKED ME AND THEY SULLENLY STERNLY STEADILY OVERLOOKED ME I THINK MR MURDSTONES MEANS WERE STRAITENED AT ABOUT THIS TIME BUT IT IS LITTLE TO THE PURPOSE HE COULD NOT BEAR ME AND IN PUTTING ME FROM HIM HE TRIED AS I BELIEVE TO PUT AWAY THE NOTION THAT I HAD ANY CLAIM UPON HIMAND SUCCEEDED I WAS NOT ACTIVELY ILLUSED I WAS NOT BEATEN OR STARVED BUT THE WRONG THAT WAS DONE TO ME HAD NO INTERVALS OF RELENTING AND WAS DONE IN A SYSTEMATIC PASSIONLESS MANNER DAY AFTER DAY WEEK AFTER WEEK MONTH AFTER MONTH I WAS COLDLY NEGLECTED I WONDER SOMETIMES WHEN I THINK OF IT WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IF I HAD BEEN TAKEN WITH AN ILLNESS WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE LAIN DOWN IN MY LONELY ROOM AND LANGUISHED THROUGH IT IN MY USUAL SOLITARY WAY OR WHETHER ANYBODY WOULD HAVE HELPED ME OUT WHEN MR AND MISS MURDSTONE WERE AT HOME I TOOK MY MEALS WITH THEM IN THEIR ABSENCE I ATE AND DRANK BY MYSELF AT ALL TIMES I LOUNGED ABOUT THE HOUSE AND NEIGHBOURHOOD QUITE DISREGARDED EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE JEALOUS OF MY MAKING ANY FRIENDS THINKING PERHAPS THAT IF I DID I MIGHT COMPLAIN TO SOMEONE FOR THIS REASON THOUGH MR CHILLIP OFTEN ASKED ME TO GO AND SEE HIM HE WAS A WIDOWER HAVING SOME YEARS BEFORE THAT LOST A LITTLE SMALL LIGHTHAIRED WIFE WHOM I CAN JUST REMEMBER CONNECTING IN MY OWN THOUGHTS WITH A PALE TORTOISESHELL CAT IT WAS BUT SELDOM THAT I ENJOYED THE HAPPINESS OF PASSING AN AFTERNOON IN HIS CLOSET OF A SURGERY READING SOME BOOK THAT WAS NEW TO ME WITH THE SMELL OF THE WHOLE PHARMACOPOEIA COMING UP MY NOSE OR POUNDING SOMETHING IN A MORTAR UNDER HIS MILD DIRECTIONS FOR THE SAME REASON ADDED NO DOUBT TO THE OLD DISLIKE OF HER I WAS SELDOM ALLOWED TO VISIT PEGGOTTY FAITHFUL TO HER PROMISE SHE EITHER CAME TO SEE ME OR MET ME SOMEWHERE NEAR ONCE EVERY WEEK AND NEVER EMPTYHANDED BUT MANY AND BITTER WERE THE DISAPPOINTMENTS I HAD IN BEING REFUSED PERMISSION TO PAY A VISIT TO HER AT HER HOUSE SOME FEW TIMES HOWEVER AT LONG INTERVALS I WAS ALLOWED TO GO THERE AND THEN I FOUND OUT THAT MR BARKIS WAS SOMETHING OF A MISER OR AS PEGGOTTY DUTIFULLY EXPRESSED IT WAS A LITTLE NEAR AND KEPT A HEAP OF MONEY IN A BOX UNDER HIS BED WHICH HE PRETENDED WAS ONLY FULL OF COATS AND TROUSERS IN THIS COFFER HIS RICHES HID THEMSELVES WITH SUCH A TENACIOUS MODESTY THAT THE SMALLEST INSTALMENTS COULD ONLY BE TEMPTED OUT BY ARTIFICE SO THAT PEGGOTTY HAD TO PREPARE A LONG AND ELABORATE SCHEME A VERY GUNPOWDER PLOT FOR EVERY SATURDAYS EXPENSES ALL THIS TIME I WAS SO CONSCIOUS OF THE WASTE OF ANY PROMISE I HAD GIVEN AND OF MY BEING UTTERLY NEGLECTED THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY MISERABLE I HAVE NO DOUBT BUT FOR THE OLD BOOKS THEY WERE MY ONLY COMFORT AND I WAS AS TRUE TO THEM AS THEY WERE TO ME AND READ THEM OVER AND OVER I DONT KNOW HOW MANY TIMES MORE I NOW APPROACH A PERIOD OF MY LIFE WHICH I CAN NEVER LOSE THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHILE I REMEMBER ANYTHING AND THE RECOLLECTION OF WHICH HAS OFTEN WITHOUT MY INVOCATION COME BEFORE ME LIKE A GHOST AND HAUNTED HAPPIER TIMES I HAD BEEN OUT ONE DAY LOITERING SOMEWHERE IN THE LISTLESS MEDITATIVE MANNER THAT MY WAY OF LIFE ENGENDERED WHEN TURNING THE CORNER OF A LANE NEAR OUR HOUSE I CAME UPON MR MURDSTONE WALKING WITH A GENTLEMAN I WAS CONFUSED AND WAS GOING BY THEM WHEN THE GENTLEMAN CRIED WHAT BROOKS NO SIR DAVID COPPERFIELD I SAID DONT TELL ME YOU ARE BROOKS SAID THE GENTLEMAN YOU ARE BROOKS OF SHEFFIELD THATS YOUR NAME AT THESE WORDS I OBSERVED THE GENTLEMAN MORE ATTENTIVELY HIS LAUGH COMING TO MY REMEMBRANCE TOO I KNEW HIM TO BE MR QUINION WHOM I HAD GONE OVER TO LOWESTOFT WITH MR MURDSTONE TO SEE BEFOREIT IS NO MATTERI NEED NOT RECALL WHEN AND HOW DO YOU GET ON AND WHERE ARE YOU BEING EDUCATED BROOKS SAID MR QUINION HE HAD PUT HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER AND TURNED ME ABOUT TO WALK WITH THEM I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO REPLY AND GLANCED DUBIOUSLY AT MR MURDSTONE HE IS AT HOME AT PRESENT SAID THE LATTER HE IS NOT BEING EDUCATED ANYWHERE I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM HE IS A DIFFICULT SUBJECT THAT OLD DOUBLE LOOK WAS ON ME FOR A MOMENT AND THEN HIS EYES DARKENED WITH A FROWN AS IT TURNED IN ITS AVERSION ELSEWHERE HUMPH SAID MR QUINION LOOKING AT US BOTH I THOUGHT FINE WEATHER SILENCE ENSUED AND I WAS CONSIDERING HOW I COULD BEST DISENGAGE MY SHOULDER FROM HIS HAND AND GO AWAY WHEN HE SAID I SUPPOSE YOU ARE A PRETTY SHARP FELLOW STILL EH BROOKS AYE HE IS SHARP ENOUGH SAID MR MURDSTONE IMPATIENTLY YOU HAD BETTER LET HIM GO HE WILL NOT THANK YOU FOR TROUBLING HIM ON THIS HINT MR QUINION RELEASED ME AND I MADE THE BEST OF MY WAY HOME LOOKING BACK AS I TURNED INTO THE FRONT GARDEN I SAW MR MURDSTONE LEANING AGAINST THE WICKET OF THE CHURCHYARD AND MR QUINION TALKING TO HIM THEY WERE BOTH LOOKING AFTER ME AND I FELT THAT THEY WERE SPEAKING OF ME MR QUINION LAY AT OUR HOUSE THAT NIGHT AFTER BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING I HAD PUT MY CHAIR AWAY AND WAS GOING OUT OF THE ROOM WHEN MR MURDSTONE CALLED ME BACK HE THEN GRAVELY REPAIRED TO ANOTHER TABLE WHERE HIS SISTER SAT HERSELF AT HER DESK MR QUINION WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS STOOD LOOKING OUT OF WINDOW AND I STOOD LOOKING AT THEM ALL DAVID SAID MR MURDSTONE TO THE YOUNG THIS IS A WORLD FOR ACTION NOT FOR MOPING AND DRONING IN AS YOU DO ADDED HIS SISTER JANE MURDSTONE LEAVE IT TO ME IF YOU PLEASE I SAY DAVID TO THE YOUNG THIS IS A WORLD FOR ACTION AND NOT FOR MOPING AND DRONING IN IT IS ESPECIALLY SO FOR A YOUNG BOY OF YOUR DISPOSITION WHICH REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF CORRECTING AND TO WHICH NO GREATER SERVICE CAN BE DONE THAN TO FORCE IT TO CONFORM TO THE WAYS OF THE WORKING WORLD AND TO BEND IT AND BREAK IT FOR STUBBORNNESS WONT DO HERE SAID HIS SISTER WHAT IT WANTS IS TO BE CRUSHED AND CRUSHED IT MUST BE SHALL BE TOO HE GAVE HER A LOOK HALF IN REMONSTRANCE HALF IN APPROVAL AND WENT ON I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW DAVID THAT I AM NOT RICH AT ANY RATE YOU KNOW IT NOW YOU HAVE RECEIVED SOME CONSIDERABLE EDUCATION ALREADY EDUCATION IS COSTLY AND EVEN IF IT WERE NOT AND I COULD AFFORD IT I AM OF OPINION THAT IT WOULD NOT BE AT ALL ADVANTAGEOUS TO YOU TO BE KEPT AT SCHOOL WHAT IS BEFORE YOU IS A FIGHT WITH THE WORLD AND THE SOONER YOU BEGIN IT THE BETTER I THINK IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I HAD ALREADY BEGUN IT IN MY POOR WAY BUT IT OCCURS TO ME NOW WHETHER OR NO YOU HAVE HEARD THE COUNTINGHOUSE MENTIONED SOMETIMES SAID MR MURDSTONE THE COUNTINGHOUSE SIR I REPEATED OF MURDSTONE AND GRINBY IN THE WINE TRADE HE REPLIED I SUPPOSE I LOOKED UNCERTAIN FOR HE WENT ON HASTILY YOU HAVE HEARD THE COUNTINGHOUSE MENTIONED OR THE BUSINESS OR THE CELLARS OR THE WHARF OR SOMETHING ABOUT IT I THINK I HAVE HEARD THE BUSINESS MENTIONED SIR I SAID REMEMBERING WHAT I VAGUELY KNEW OF HIS AND HIS SISTERS RESOURCES BUT I DONT KNOW WHEN IT DOES NOT MATTER WHEN HE RETURNED MR QUINION MANAGES THAT BUSINESS I GLANCED AT THE LATTER DEFERENTIALLY AS HE STOOD LOOKING OUT OF WINDOW MR QUINION SUGGESTS THAT IT GIVES EMPLOYMENT TO SOME OTHER BOYS AND THAT HE SEES NO REASON WHY IT SHOULDNT ON THE SAME TERMS GIVE EMPLOYMENT TO YOU HE HAVING MR QUINION OBSERVED IN A LOW VOICE AND HALF TURNING ROUND NO OTHER PROSPECT MURDSTONE MR MURDSTONE WITH AN IMPATIENT EVEN AN ANGRY GESTURE RESUMED WITHOUT NOTICING WHAT HE HAD SAID THOSE TERMS ARE THAT YOU WILL EARN ENOUGH FOR YOURSELF TO PROVIDE FOR YOUR EATING AND DRINKING AND POCKETMONEY YOUR LODGING WHICH I HAVE ARRANGED FOR WILL BE PAID BY ME SO WILL YOUR WASHING WHICH WILL BE KEPT DOWN TO MY ESTIMATE SAID HIS SISTER YOUR CLOTHES WILL BE LOOKED AFTER FOR YOU TOO SAID MR MURDSTONE AS YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE YET AWHILE TO GET THEM FOR YOURSELF SO YOU ARE NOW GOING TO LONDON DAVID WITH MR QUINION TO BEGIN THE WORLD ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT IN SHORT YOU ARE PROVIDED FOR OBSERVED HIS SISTER AND WILL PLEASE TO DO YOUR DUTY THOUGH I QUITE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS TO GET RID OF ME I HAVE NO DISTINCT REMEMBRANCE WHETHER IT PLEASED OR FRIGHTENED ME MY IMPRESSION IS THAT I WAS IN A STATE OF CONFUSION ABOUT IT AND OSCILLATING BETWEEN THE TWO POINTS TOUCHED NEITHER NOR HAD I MUCH TIME FOR THE CLEARING OF MY THOUGHTS AS MR QUINION WAS TO GO UPON THE MORROW BEHOLD ME ON THE MORROW IN A MUCHWORN LITTLE WHITE HAT WITH A BLACK CRAPE ROUND IT FOR MY MOTHER A BLACK JACKET AND A PAIR OF HARD STIFF CORDUROY TROUSERSWHICH MISS MURDSTONE CONSIDERED THE BEST ARMOUR FOR THE LEGS IN THAT FIGHT WITH THE WORLD WHICH WAS NOW TO COME OFF BEHOLD ME SO ATTIRED AND WITH MY LITTLE WORLDLY ALL BEFORE ME IN A SMALL TRUNK SITTING A LONE LORN CHILD AS MRS GUMMIDGE MIGHT HAVE SAID IN THE POSTCHAISE THAT WAS CARRYING MR QUINION TO THE LONDON COACH AT YARMOUTH SEE HOW OUR HOUSE AND CHURCH ARE LESSENING IN THE DISTANCE HOW THE GRAVE BENEATH THE TREE IS BLOTTED OUT BY INTERVENING OBJECTS HOW THE SPIRE POINTS UPWARDS FROM MY OLD PLAYGROUND NO MORE AND THE SKY IS EMPTY CHAPTER I BEGIN LIFE ON MY OWN ACCOUNT AND DONT LIKE IT I KNOW ENOUGH OF THE WORLD NOW TO HAVE ALMOST LOST THE CAPACITY OF BEING MUCH SURPRISED BY ANYTHING BUT IT IS MATTER OF SOME SURPRISE TO ME EVEN NOW THAT I CAN HAVE BEEN SO EASILY THROWN AWAY AT SUCH AN AGE A CHILD OF EXCELLENT ABILITIES AND WITH STRONG POWERS OF OBSERVATION QUICK EAGER DELICATE AND SOON HURT BODILY OR MENTALLY IT SEEMS WONDERFUL TO ME THAT NOBODY SHOULD HAVE MADE ANY SIGN IN MY BEHALF BUT NONE WAS MADE AND I BECAME AT TEN YEARS OLD A LITTLE LABOURING HIND IN THE SERVICE OF MURDSTONE AND GRINBY MURDSTONE AND GRINBYS WAREHOUSE WAS AT THE WATERSIDE IT WAS DOWN IN BLACKFRIARS MODERN IMPROVEMENTS HAVE ALTERED THE PLACE BUT IT WAS THE LAST HOUSE AT THE BOTTOM OF A NARROW STREET CURVING DOWN HILL TO THE RIVER WITH SOME STAIRS AT THE END WHERE PEOPLE TOOK BOAT IT WAS A CRAZY OLD HOUSE WITH A WHARF OF ITS OWN ABUTTING ON THE WATER WHEN THE TIDE WAS IN AND ON THE MUD WHEN THE TIDE WAS OUT AND LITERALLY OVERRUN WITH RATS ITS PANELLED ROOMS DISCOLOURED WITH THE DIRT AND SMOKE OF A HUNDRED YEARS I DARE SAY ITS DECAYING FLOORS AND STAIRCASE THE SQUEAKING AND SCUFFLING OF THE OLD GREY RATS DOWN IN THE CELLARS AND THE DIRT AND ROTTENNESS OF THE PLACE ARE THINGS NOT OF MANY YEARS AGO IN MY MIND BUT OF THE PRESENT INSTANT THEY ARE ALL BEFORE ME JUST AS THEY WERE IN THE EVIL HOUR WHEN I WENT AMONG THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH MY TREMBLING HAND IN MR QUINIONS MURDSTONE AND GRINBYS TRADE WAS AMONG A GOOD MANY KINDS OF PEOPLE BUT AN IMPORTANT BRANCH OF IT WAS THE SUPPLY OF WINES AND SPIRITS TO CERTAIN PACKET SHIPS I FORGET NOW WHERE THEY CHIEFLY WENT BUT I THINK THERE WERE SOME AMONG THEM THAT MADE VOYAGES BOTH TO THE EAST AND WEST INDIES I KNOW THAT A GREAT MANY EMPTY BOTTLES WERE ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS TRAFFIC AND THAT CERTAIN MEN AND BOYS WERE EMPLOYED TO EXAMINE THEM AGAINST THE LIGHT AND REJECT THOSE THAT WERE FLAWED AND TO RINSE AND WASH THEM WHEN THE EMPTY BOTTLES RAN SHORT THERE WERE LABELS TO BE PASTED ON FULL ONES OR CORKS TO BE FITTED TO THEM OR SEALS TO BE PUT UPON THE CORKS OR FINISHED BOTTLES TO BE PACKED IN CASKS ALL THIS WORK WAS MY WORK AND OF THE BOYS EMPLOYED UPON IT I WAS ONE THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR OF US COUNTING ME MY WORKING PLACE WAS ESTABLISHED IN A CORNER OF THE WAREHOUSE WHERE MR QUINION COULD SEE ME WHEN HE CHOSE TO STAND UP ON THE BOTTOM RAIL OF HIS STOOL IN THE COUNTINGHOUSE AND LOOK AT ME THROUGH A WINDOW ABOVE THE DESK HITHER ON THE FIRST MORNING OF MY SO AUSPICIOUSLY BEGINNING LIFE ON MY OWN ACCOUNT THE OLDEST OF THE REGULAR BOYS WAS SUMMONED TO SHOW ME MY BUSINESS HIS NAME WAS MICK WALKER AND HE WORE A RAGGED APRON AND A PAPER CAP HE INFORMED ME THAT HIS FATHER WAS A BARGEMAN AND WALKED IN A BLACK VELVET HEADDRESS IN THE LORD MAYORS SHOW HE ALSO INFORMED ME THAT OUR PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATE WOULD BE ANOTHER BOY WHOM HE INTRODUCED BY THETO MEEXTRAORDINARY NAME OF MEALY POTATOES I DISCOVERED HOWEVER THAT THIS YOUTH HAD NOT BEEN CHRISTENED BY THAT NAME BUT THAT IT HAD BEEN BESTOWED UPON HIM IN THE WAREHOUSE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS COMPLEXION WHICH WAS PALE OR MEALY MEALYS FATHER WAS A WATERMAN WHO HAD THE ADDITIONAL DISTINCTION OF BEING A FIREMAN AND WAS ENGAGED AS SUCH AT ONE OF THE LARGE THEATRES WHERE SOME YOUNG RELATION OF MEALYSI THINK HIS LITTLE SISTERDID IMPS IN THE PANTOMIMES NO WORDS CAN EXPRESS THE SECRET AGONY OF MY SOUL AS I SUNK INTO THIS COMPANIONSHIP COMPARED THESE HENCEFORTH EVERYDAY ASSOCIATES WITH THOSE OF MY HAPPIER CHILDHOODNOT TO SAY WITH STEERFORTH TRADDLES AND THE REST OF THOSE BOYS AND FELT MY HOPES OF GROWING UP TO BE A LEARNED AND DISTINGUISHED MAN CRUSHED IN MY BOSOM THE DEEP REMEMBRANCE OF THE SENSE I HAD OF BEING UTTERLY WITHOUT HOPE NOW OF THE SHAME I FELT IN MY POSITION OF THE MISERY IT WAS TO MY YOUNG HEART TO BELIEVE THAT DAY BY DAY WHAT I HAD LEARNED AND THOUGHT AND DELIGHTED IN AND RAISED MY FANCY AND MY EMULATION UP BY WOULD PASS AWAY FROM ME LITTLE BY LITTLE NEVER TO BE BROUGHT BACK ANY MORE CANNOT BE WRITTEN AS OFTEN AS MICK WALKER WENT AWAY IN THE COURSE OF THAT FORENOON I MINGLED MY TEARS WITH THE WATER IN WHICH I WAS WASHING THE BOTTLES AND SOBBED AS IF THERE WERE A FLAW IN MY OWN BREAST AND IT WERE IN DANGER OF BURSTING THE COUNTINGHOUSE CLOCK WAS AT HALF PAST TWELVE AND THERE WAS GENERAL PREPARATION FOR GOING TO DINNER WHEN MR QUINION TAPPED AT THE COUNTINGHOUSE WINDOW AND BECKONED TO ME TO GO IN I WENT IN AND FOUND THERE A STOUTISH MIDDLEAGED PERSON IN A BROWN SURTOUT AND BLACK TIGHTS AND SHOES WITH NO MORE HAIR UPON HIS HEAD WHICH WAS A LARGE ONE AND VERY SHINING THAN THERE IS UPON AN EGG AND WITH A VERY EXTENSIVE FACE WHICH HE TURNED FULL UPON ME HIS CLOTHES WERE SHABBY BUT HE HAD AN IMPOSING SHIRTCOLLAR ON HE CARRIED A JAUNTY SORT OF A STICK WITH A LARGE PAIR OF RUSTY TASSELS TO IT AND A QUIZZINGGLASS HUNG OUTSIDE HIS COATFOR ORNAMENT I AFTERWARDS FOUND AS HE VERY SELDOM LOOKED THROUGH IT AND COULDNT SEE ANYTHING WHEN HE DID THIS SAID MR QUINION IN ALLUSION TO MYSELF IS HE THIS SAID THE STRANGER WITH A CERTAIN CONDESCENDING ROLL IN HIS VOICE AND A CERTAIN INDESCRIBABLE AIR OF DOING SOMETHING GENTEEL WHICH IMPRESSED ME VERY MUCH IS MASTER COPPERFIELD I HOPE I SEE YOU WELL SIR I SAID I WAS VERY WELL AND HOPED HE WAS I WAS SUFFICIENTLY ILL AT EASE HEAVEN KNOWS BUT IT WAS NOT IN MY NATURE TO COMPLAIN MUCH AT THAT TIME OF MY LIFE SO I SAID I WAS VERY WELL AND HOPED HE WAS I AM SAID THE STRANGER THANK HEAVEN QUITE WELL I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MR MURDSTONE IN WHICH HE MENTIONS THAT HE WOULD DESIRE ME TO RECEIVE INTO AN APARTMENT IN THE REAR OF MY HOUSE WHICH IS AT PRESENT UNOCCUPIEDAND IS IN SHORT TO BE LET AS AIN SHORT SAID THE STRANGER WITH A SMILE AND IN A BURST OF CONFIDENCE AS A BEDROOMTHE YOUNG BEGINNER WHOM I HAVE NOW THE PLEASURE TO AND THE STRANGER WAVED HIS HAND AND SETTLED HIS CHIN IN HIS SHIRTCOLLAR THIS IS MR MICAWBER SAID MR QUINION TO ME AHEM SAID THE STRANGER THAT IS MY NAME MR MICAWBER SAID MR QUINION IS KNOWN TO MR MURDSTONE HE TAKES ORDERS FOR US ON COMMISSION WHEN HE CAN GET ANY HE HAS BEEN WRITTEN TO BY MR MURDSTONE ON THE SUBJECT OF YOUR LODGINGS AND HE WILL RECEIVE YOU AS A LODGER MY ADDRESS SAID MR MICAWBER IS WINDSOR TERRACE CITY ROAD IIN SHORT SAID MR MICAWBER WITH THE SAME GENTEEL AIR AND IN ANOTHER BURST OF CONFIDENCEI LIVE THERE I MADE HIM A BOW UNDER THE IMPRESSION SAID MR MICAWBER THAT YOUR PEREGRINATIONS IN THIS METROPOLIS HAVE NOT AS YET BEEN EXTENSIVE AND THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN PENETRATING THE ARCANA OF THE MODERN BABYLON IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY ROADIN SHORT SAID MR MICAWBER IN ANOTHER BURST OF CONFIDENCE THAT YOU MIGHT LOSE YOURSELFI SHALL BE HAPPY TO CALL THIS EVENING AND INSTALL YOU IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEAREST WAY I THANKED HIM WITH ALL MY HEART FOR IT WAS FRIENDLY IN HIM TO OFFER TO TAKE THAT TROUBLE AT WHAT HOUR SAID MR MICAWBER SHALL I AT ABOUT EIGHT SAID MR QUINION AT ABOUT EIGHT SAID MR MICAWBER I BEG TO WISH YOU GOOD DAY MR QUINION I WILL INTRUDE NO LONGER SO HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND WENT OUT WITH HIS CANE UNDER HIS ARM VERY UPRIGHT AND HUMMING A TUNE WHEN HE WAS CLEAR OF THE COUNTINGHOUSE MR QUINION THEN FORMALLY ENGAGED ME TO BE AS USEFUL AS I COULD IN THE WAREHOUSE OF MURDSTONE AND GRINBY AT A SALARY I THINK OF SIX SHILLINGS A WEEK I AM NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT WAS SIX OR SEVEN I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE FROM MY UNCERTAINTY ON THIS HEAD THAT IT WAS SIX AT FIRST AND SEVEN AFTERWARDS HE PAID ME A WEEK DOWN FROM HIS OWN POCKET I BELIEVE AND I GAVE MEALY SIXPENCE OUT OF IT TO GET MY TRUNK CARRIED TO WINDSOR TERRACE THAT NIGHT IT BEING TOO HEAVY FOR MY STRENGTH SMALL AS IT WAS I PAID SIXPENCE MORE FOR MY DINNER WHICH WAS A MEAT PIE AND A TURN AT A NEIGHBOURING PUMP AND PASSED THE HOUR WHICH WAS ALLOWED FOR THAT MEAL IN WALKING ABOUT THE STREETS AT THE APPOINTED TIME IN THE EVENING MR MICAWBER REAPPEARED I WASHED MY HANDS AND FACE TO DO THE GREATER HONOUR TO HIS GENTILITY AND WE WALKED TO OUR HOUSE AS I SUPPOSE I MUST NOW CALL IT TOGETHER MR MICAWBER IMPRESSING THE NAME OF STREETS AND THE SHAPES OF CORNER HOUSES UPON ME AS WE WENT ALONG THAT I MIGHT FIND MY WAY BACK EASILY IN THE MORNING ARRIVED AT THIS HOUSE IN WINDSOR TERRACE WHICH I NOTICED WAS SHABBY LIKE HIMSELF BUT ALSO LIKE HIMSELF MADE ALL THE SHOW IT COULD HE PRESENTED ME TO MRS MICAWBER A THIN AND FADED LADY NOT AT ALL YOUNG WHO WAS SITTING IN THE PARLOUR THE FIRST FLOOR WAS ALTOGETHER UNFURNISHED AND THE BLINDS WERE KEPT DOWN TO DELUDE THE NEIGHBOURS WITH A BABY AT HER BREAST THIS BABY WAS ONE OF TWINS AND I MAY REMARK HERE THAT I HARDLY EVER IN ALL MY EXPERIENCE OF THE FAMILY SAW BOTH THE TWINS DETACHED FROM MRS MICAWBER AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THEM WAS ALWAYS TAKING REFRESHMENT THERE WERE TWO OTHER CHILDREN MASTER MICAWBER AGED ABOUT FOUR AND MISS MICAWBER AGED ABOUT THREE THESE AND A DARKCOMPLEXIONED YOUNG WOMAN WITH A HABIT OF SNORTING WHO WAS SERVANT TO THE FAMILY AND INFORMED ME BEFORE HALF AN HOUR HAD EXPIRED THAT SHE WAS A ORFLING AND CAME FROM ST LUKES WORKHOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD COMPLETED THE ESTABLISHMENT MY ROOM WAS AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE AT THE BACK A CLOSE CHAMBER STENCILLED ALL OVER WITH AN ORNAMENT WHICH MY YOUNG IMAGINATION REPRESENTED AS A BLUE MUFFIN AND VERY SCANTILY FURNISHED I NEVER THOUGHT SAID MRS MICAWBER WHEN SHE CAME UP TWIN AND ALL TO SHOW ME THE APARTMENT AND SAT DOWN TO TAKE BREATH BEFORE I WAS MARRIED WHEN I LIVED WITH PAPA AND MAMA THAT I SHOULD EVER FIND IT NECESSARY TO TAKE A LODGER BUT MR MICAWBER BEING IN DIFFICULTIES ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF PRIVATE FEELING MUST GIVE WAY I SAID YES MAAM MR MICAWBERS DIFFICULTIES ARE ALMOST OVERWHELMING JUST AT PRESENT SAID MRS MICAWBER AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO BRING HIM THROUGH THEM I DONT KNOW WHEN I LIVED AT HOME WITH PAPA AND MAMA I REALLY SHOULD HAVE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE WORD MEANT IN THE SENSE IN WHICH I NOW EMPLOY IT BUT EXPERIENTIA DOES ITAS PAPA USED TO SAY I CANNOT SATISFY MYSELF WHETHER SHE TOLD ME THAT MR MICAWBER HAD BEEN AN OFFICER IN THE MARINES OR WHETHER I HAVE IMAGINED IT I ONLY KNOW THAT I BELIEVE TO THIS HOUR THAT HE WAS IN THE MARINES ONCE UPON A TIME WITHOUT KNOWING WHY HE WAS A SORT OF TOWN TRAVELLER FOR A NUMBER OF MISCELLANEOUS HOUSES NOW BUT MADE LITTLE OR NOTHING OF IT I AM AFRAID IF MR MICAWBERS CREDITORS WILL NOT GIVE HIM TIME SAID MRS MICAWBER THEY MUST TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES AND THE SOONER THEY BRING IT TO AN ISSUE THE BETTER BLOOD CANNOT BE OBTAINED FROM A STONE NEITHER CAN ANYTHING ON ACCOUNT BE OBTAINED AT PRESENT NOT TO MENTION LAW EXPENSES FROM MR MICAWBER I NEVER CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND WHETHER MY PRECOCIOUS SELFDEPENDENCE CONFUSED MRS MICAWBER IN REFERENCE TO MY AGE OR WHETHER SHE WAS SO FULL OF THE SUBJECT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT TO THE VERY TWINS IF THERE HAD BEEN NOBODY ELSE TO COMMUNICATE WITH BUT THIS WAS THE STRAIN IN WHICH SHE BEGAN AND SHE WENT ON ACCORDINGLY ALL THE TIME I KNEW HER POOR MRS MICAWBER SHE SAID SHE HAD TRIED TO EXERT HERSELF AND SO I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE HAD THE CENTRE OF THE STREET DOOR WAS PERFECTLY COVERED WITH A GREAT BRASSPLATE ON WHICH WAS ENGRAVED MRS MICAWBERS BOARDING ESTABLISHMENT FOR YOUNG LADIES BUT I NEVER FOUND THAT ANY YOUNG LADY HAD EVER BEEN TO SCHOOL THERE OR THAT ANY YOUNG LADY EVER CAME OR PROPOSED TO COME OR THAT THE LEAST PREPARATION WAS EVER MADE TO RECEIVE ANY YOUNG LADY THE ONLY VISITORS I EVER SAW OR HEARD OF WERE CREDITORS THEY USED TO COME AT ALL HOURS AND SOME OF THEM WERE QUITE FEROCIOUS ONE DIRTYFACED MAN I THINK HE WAS A BOOTMAKER USED TO EDGE HIMSELF INTO THE PASSAGE AS EARLY AS SEVEN OCLOCK IN THE MORNING AND CALL UP THE STAIRS TO MR MICAWBERCOME YOU AINT OUT YET YOU KNOW PAY US WILL YOU DONT HIDE YOU KNOW THATS MEAN I WOULDNT BE MEAN IF I WAS YOU PAY US WILL YOU YOU JUST PAY US DYE HEAR COME RECEIVING NO ANSWER TO THESE TAUNTS HE WOULD MOUNT IN HIS WRATH TO THE WORDS SWINDLERS AND ROBBERS AND THESE BEING INEFFECTUAL TOO WOULD SOMETIMES GO TO THE EXTREMITY OF CROSSING THE STREET AND ROARING UP AT THE WINDOWS OF THE SECOND FLOOR WHERE HE KNEW MR MICAWBER WAS AT THESE TIMES MR MICAWBER WOULD BE TRANSPORTED WITH GRIEF AND MORTIFICATION EVEN TO THE LENGTH AS I WAS ONCE MADE AWARE BY A SCREAM FROM HIS WIFE OF MAKING MOTIONS AT HIMSELF WITH A RAZOR BUT WITHIN HALFANHOUR AFTERWARDS HE WOULD POLISH UP HIS SHOES WITH EXTRAORDINARY PAINS AND GO OUT HUMMING A TUNE WITH A GREATER AIR OF GENTILITY THAN EVER MRS MICAWBER WAS QUITE AS ELASTIC I HAVE KNOWN HER TO BE THROWN INTO FAINTING FITS BY THE KINGS TAXES AT THREE OCLOCK AND TO EAT LAMB CHOPS BREADED AND DRINK WARM ALE PAID FOR WITH TWO TEASPOONS THAT HAD GONE TO THE PAWNBROKERS AT FOUR ON ONE OCCASION WHEN AN EXECUTION HAD JUST BEEN PUT IN COMING HOME THROUGH SOME CHANCE AS EARLY AS SIX OCLOCK I SAW HER LYING OF COURSE WITH A TWIN UNDER THE GRATE IN A SWOON WITH HER HAIR ALL TORN ABOUT HER FACE BUT I NEVER KNEW HER MORE CHEERFUL THAN SHE WAS THAT VERY SAME NIGHT OVER A VEAL CUTLET BEFORE THE KITCHEN FIRE TELLING ME STORIES ABOUT HER PAPA AND MAMA AND THE COMPANY THEY USED TO KEEP IN THIS HOUSE AND WITH THIS FAMILY I PASSED MY LEISURE TIME MY OWN EXCLUSIVE BREAKFAST OF A PENNY LOAF AND A PENNYWORTH OF MILK I PROVIDED MYSELF I KEPT ANOTHER SMALL LOAF AND A MODICUM OF CHEESE ON A PARTICULAR SHELF OF A PARTICULAR CUPBOARD TO MAKE MY SUPPER ON WHEN I CAME BACK AT NIGHT THIS MADE A HOLE IN THE SIX OR SEVEN SHILLINGS I KNOW WELL AND I WAS OUT AT THE WAREHOUSE ALL DAY AND HAD TO SUPPORT MYSELF ON THAT MONEY ALL THE WEEK FROM MONDAY MORNING UNTIL SATURDAY NIGHT I HAD NO ADVICE NO COUNSEL NO ENCOURAGEMENT NO CONSOLATION NO ASSISTANCE NO SUPPORT OF ANY KIND FROM ANYONE THAT I CAN CALL TO MIND AS I HOPE TO GO TO HEAVEN I WAS SO YOUNG AND CHILDISH AND SO LITTLE QUALIFIEDHOW COULD I BE OTHERWISETO UNDERTAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF MY OWN EXISTENCE THAT OFTEN IN GOING TO MURDSTONE AND GRINBYS OF A MORNING I COULD NOT RESIST THE STALE PASTRY PUT OUT FOR SALE AT HALFPRICE AT THE PASTRYCOOKS DOORS AND SPENT IN THAT THE MONEY I SHOULD HAVE KEPT FOR MY DINNER THEN I WENT WITHOUT MY DINNER OR BOUGHT A ROLL OR A SLICE OF PUDDING I REMEMBER TWO PUDDING SHOPS BETWEEN WHICH I WAS DIVIDED ACCORDING TO MY FINANCES ONE WAS IN A COURT CLOSE TO ST MARTINS CHURCHAT THE BACK OF THE CHURCHWHICH IS NOW REMOVED ALTOGETHER THE PUDDING AT THAT SHOP WAS MADE OF CURRANTS AND WAS RATHER A SPECIAL PUDDING BUT WAS DEAR TWOPENNYWORTH NOT BEING LARGER THAN A PENNYWORTH OF MORE ORDINARY PUDDING A GOOD SHOP FOR THE LATTER WAS IN THE STRANDSOMEWHERE IN THAT PART WHICH HAS BEEN REBUILT SINCE IT WAS A STOUT PALE PUDDING HEAVY AND FLABBY AND WITH GREAT FLAT RAISINS IN IT STUCK IN WHOLE AT WIDE DISTANCES APART IT CAME UP HOT AT ABOUT MY TIME EVERY DAY AND MANY A DAY DID I DINE OFF IT WHEN I DINED REGULARLY AND HANDSOMELY I HAD A SAVELOY AND A PENNY LOAF OR A FOURPENNY PLATE OF RED BEEF FROM A COOKS SHOP OR A PLATE OF BREAD AND CHEESE AND A GLASS OF BEER FROM A MISERABLE OLD PUBLICHOUSE OPPOSITE OUR PLACE OF BUSINESS CALLED THE LION OR THE LION AND SOMETHING ELSE THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ONCE I REMEMBER CARRYING MY OWN BREAD WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM HOME IN THE MORNING UNDER MY ARM WRAPPED IN A PIECE OF PAPER LIKE A BOOK AND GOING TO A FAMOUS ALAMODE BEEFHOUSE NEAR DRURY LANE AND ORDERING A SMALL PLATE OF THAT DELICACY TO EAT WITH IT WHAT THE WAITER THOUGHT OF SUCH A STRANGE LITTLE APPARITION COMING IN ALL ALONE I DONT KNOW BUT I CAN SEE HIM NOW STARING AT ME AS I ATE MY DINNER AND BRINGING UP THE OTHER WAITER TO LOOK I GAVE HIM A HALFPENNY FOR HIMSELF AND I WISH HE HADNT TAKEN IT WE HAD HALFANHOUR I THINK FOR TEA WHEN I HAD MONEY ENOUGH I USED TO GET HALFAPINT OF READYMADE COFFEE AND A SLICE OF BREAD AND BUTTER WHEN I HAD NONE I USED TO LOOK AT A VENISON SHOP IN FLEET STREET OR I HAVE STROLLED AT SUCH A TIME AS FAR AS COVENT GARDEN MARKET AND STARED AT THE PINEAPPLES I WAS FOND OF WANDERING ABOUT THE ADELPHI BECAUSE IT WAS A MYSTERIOUS PLACE WITH THOSE DARK ARCHES I SEE MYSELF EMERGING ONE EVENING FROM SOME OF THESE ARCHES ON A LITTLE PUBLICHOUSE CLOSE TO THE RIVER WITH AN OPEN SPACE BEFORE IT WHERE SOME COALHEAVERS WERE DANCING TO LOOK AT WHOM I SAT DOWN UPON A BENCH I WONDER WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF ME I WAS SUCH A CHILD AND SO LITTLE THAT FREQUENTLY WHEN I WENT INTO THE BAR OF A STRANGE PUBLICHOUSE FOR A GLASS OF ALE OR PORTER TO MOISTEN WHAT I HAD HAD FOR DINNER THEY WERE AFRAID TO GIVE IT ME I REMEMBER ONE HOT EVENING I WENT INTO THE BAR OF A PUBLICHOUSE AND SAID TO THE LANDLORD WHAT IS YOUR BESTYOUR VERY BESTALE A GLASS FOR IT WAS A SPECIAL OCCASION I DONT KNOW WHAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN MY BIRTHDAY TWOPENCEHALFPENNY SAYS THE LANDLORD IS THE PRICE OF THE GENUINE STUNNING ALE THEN SAYS I PRODUCING THE MONEY JUST DRAW ME A GLASS OF THE GENUINE STUNNING IF YOU PLEASE WITH A GOOD HEAD TO IT THE LANDLORD LOOKED AT ME IN RETURN OVER THE BAR FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH A STRANGE SMILE ON HIS FACE AND INSTEAD OF DRAWING THE BEER LOOKED ROUND THE SCREEN AND SAID SOMETHING TO HIS WIFE SHE CAME OUT FROM BEHIND IT WITH HER WORK IN HER HAND AND JOINED HIM IN SURVEYING ME HERE WE STAND ALL THREE BEFORE ME NOW THE LANDLORD IN HIS SHIRTSLEEVES LEANING AGAINST THE BAR WINDOWFRAME HIS WIFE LOOKING OVER THE LITTLE HALFDOOR AND I IN SOME CONFUSION LOOKING UP AT THEM FROM OUTSIDE THE PARTITION THEY ASKED ME A GOOD MANY QUESTIONS AS WHAT MY NAME WAS HOW OLD I WAS WHERE I LIVED HOW I WAS EMPLOYED AND HOW I CAME THERE TO ALL OF WHICH THAT I MIGHT COMMIT NOBODY I INVENTED I AM AFRAID APPROPRIATE ANSWERS THEY SERVED ME WITH THE ALE THOUGH I SUSPECT IT WAS NOT THE GENUINE STUNNING AND THE LANDLORDS WIFE OPENING THE LITTLE HALFDOOR OF THE BAR AND BENDING DOWN GAVE ME MY MONEY BACK AND GAVE ME A KISS THAT WAS HALF ADMIRING AND HALF COMPASSIONATE BUT ALL WOMANLY AND GOOD I AM SURE I KNOW I DO NOT EXAGGERATE UNCONSCIOUSLY AND UNINTENTIONALLY THE SCANTINESS OF MY RESOURCES OR THE DIFFICULTIES OF MY LIFE I KNOW THAT IF A SHILLING WERE GIVEN ME BY MR QUINION AT ANY TIME I SPENT IT IN A DINNER OR A TEA I KNOW THAT I WORKED FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT WITH COMMON MEN AND BOYS A SHABBY CHILD I KNOW THAT I LOUNGED ABOUT THE STREETS INSUFFICIENTLY AND UNSATISFACTORILY FED I KNOW THAT BUT FOR THE MERCY OF GOD I MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN FOR ANY CARE THAT WAS TAKEN OF ME A LITTLE ROBBER OR A LITTLE VAGABOND YET I HELD SOME STATION AT MURDSTONE AND GRINBYS TOO BESIDES THAT MR QUINION DID WHAT A CARELESS MAN SO OCCUPIED AND DEALING WITH A THING SO ANOMALOUS COULD TO TREAT ME AS ONE UPON A DIFFERENT FOOTING FROM THE REST I NEVER SAID TO MAN OR BOY HOW IT WAS THAT I CAME TO BE THERE OR GAVE THE LEAST INDICATION OF BEING SORRY THAT I WAS THERE THAT I SUFFERED IN SECRET AND THAT I SUFFERED EXQUISITELY NO ONE EVER KNEW BUT I HOW MUCH I SUFFERED IT IS AS I HAVE SAID ALREADY UTTERLY BEYOND MY POWER TO TELL BUT I KEPT MY OWN COUNSEL AND I DID MY WORK I KNEW FROM THE FIRST THAT IF I COULD NOT DO MY WORK AS WELL AS ANY OF THE REST I COULD NOT HOLD MYSELF ABOVE SLIGHT AND CONTEMPT I SOON BECAME AT LEAST AS EXPEDITIOUS AND AS SKILFUL AS EITHER OF THE OTHER BOYS THOUGH PERFECTLY FAMILIAR WITH THEM MY CONDUCT AND MANNER WERE DIFFERENT ENOUGH FROM THEIRS TO PLACE A SPACE BETWEEN US THEY AND THE MEN GENERALLY SPOKE OF ME AS THE LITTLE GENT OR THE YOUNG SUFFOLKER A CERTAIN MAN NAMED GREGORY WHO WAS FOREMAN OF THE PACKERS AND ANOTHER NAMED TIPP WHO WAS THE CARMAN AND WORE A RED JACKET USED TO ADDRESS ME SOMETIMES AS DAVID BUT I THINK IT WAS MOSTLY WHEN WE WERE VERY CONFIDENTIAL AND WHEN I HAD MADE SOME EFFORTS TO ENTERTAIN THEM OVER OUR WORK WITH SOME RESULTS OF THE OLD READINGS WHICH WERE FAST PERISHING OUT OF MY REMEMBRANCE MEALY POTATOES UPROSE ONCE AND REBELLED AGAINST MY BEING SO DISTINGUISHED BUT MICK WALKER SETTLED HIM IN NO TIME MY RESCUE FROM THIS KIND OF EXISTENCE I CONSIDERED QUITE HOPELESS AND ABANDONED AS SUCH ALTOGETHER I AM SOLEMNLY CONVINCED THAT I NEVER FOR ONE HOUR WAS RECONCILED TO IT OR WAS OTHERWISE THAN MISERABLY UNHAPPY BUT I BORE IT AND EVEN TO PEGGOTTY PARTLY FOR THE LOVE OF HER AND PARTLY FOR SHAME NEVER IN ANY LETTER THOUGH MANY PASSED BETWEEN US REVEALED THE TRUTH MR MICAWBERS DIFFICULTIES WERE AN ADDITION TO THE DISTRESSED STATE OF MY MIND IN MY FORLORN STATE I BECAME QUITE ATTACHED TO THE FAMILY AND USED TO WALK ABOUT BUSY WITH MRS MICAWBERS CALCULATIONS OF WAYS AND MEANS AND HEAVY WITH THE WEIGHT OF MR MICAWBERS DEBTS ON A SATURDAY NIGHT WHICH WAS MY GRAND TREATPARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS A GREAT THING TO WALK HOME WITH SIX OR SEVEN SHILLINGS IN MY POCKET LOOKING INTO THE SHOPS AND THINKING WHAT SUCH A SUM WOULD BUY AND PARTLY BECAUSE I WENT HOME EARLYMRS MICAWBER WOULD MAKE THE MOST HEARTRENDING CONFIDENCES TO ME ALSO ON A SUNDAY MORNING WHEN I MIXED THE PORTION OF TEA OR COFFEE I HAD BOUGHT OVERNIGHT IN A LITTLE SHAVINGPOT AND SAT LATE AT MY BREAKFAST IT WAS NOTHING AT ALL UNUSUAL FOR MR MICAWBER TO SOB VIOLENTLY AT THE BEGINNING OF ONE OF THESE SATURDAY NIGHT CONVERSATIONS AND SING ABOUT JACKS DELIGHT BEING HIS LOVELY NAN TOWARDS THE END OF IT I HAVE KNOWN HIM COME HOME TO SUPPER WITH A FLOOD OF TEARS AND A DECLARATION THAT NOTHING WAS NOW LEFT BUT A JAIL AND GO TO BED MAKING A CALCULATION OF THE EXPENSE OF PUTTING BOWWINDOWS TO THE HOUSE IN CASE ANYTHING TURNED UP WHICH WAS HIS FAVOURITE EXPRESSION AND MRS MICAWBER WAS JUST THE SAME A CURIOUS EQUALITY OF FRIENDSHIP ORIGINATING I SUPPOSE IN OUR RESPECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES SPRUNG UP BETWEEN ME AND THESE PEOPLE NOTWITHSTANDING THE LUDICROUS DISPARITY IN OUR YEARS BUT I NEVER ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE PREVAILED UPON TO ACCEPT ANY INVITATION TO EAT AND DRINK WITH THEM OUT OF THEIR STOCK KNOWING THAT THEY GOT ON BADLY WITH THE BUTCHER AND BAKER AND HAD OFTEN NOT TOO MUCH FOR THEMSELVES UNTIL MRS MICAWBER TOOK ME INTO HER ENTIRE CONFIDENCE THIS SHE DID ONE EVENING AS FOLLOWS MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID MRS MICAWBER I MAKE NO STRANGER OF YOU AND THEREFORE DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT MR MICAWBERS DIFFICULTIES ARE COMING TO A CRISIS IT MADE ME VERY MISERABLE TO HEAR IT AND I LOOKED AT MRS MICAWBERS RED EYES WITH THE UTMOST SYMPATHY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HEEL OF A DUTCH CHEESEWHICH IS NOT ADAPTED TO THE WANTS OF A YOUNG FAMILYSAID MRS MICAWBER THERE IS REALLY NOT A SCRAP OF ANYTHING IN THE LARDER I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEAK OF THE LARDER WHEN I LIVED WITH PAPA AND MAMA AND I USE THE WORD ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY WHAT I MEAN TO EXPRESS IS THAT THERE IS NOTHING TO EAT IN THE HOUSE DEAR ME I SAID IN GREAT CONCERN I HAD TWO OR THREE SHILLINGS OF MY WEEKS MONEY IN MY POCKETFROM WHICH I PRESUME THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN WE HELD THIS CONVERSATIONAND I HASTILY PRODUCED THEM AND WITH HEARTFELT EMOTION BEGGED MRS MICAWBER TO ACCEPT OF THEM AS A LOAN BUT THAT LADY KISSING ME AND MAKING ME PUT THEM BACK IN MY POCKET REPLIED THAT SHE COULDNT THINK OF IT NO MY DEAR MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID SHE FAR BE IT FROM MY THOUGHTS BUT YOU HAVE A DISCRETION BEYOND YOUR YEARS AND CAN RENDER ME ANOTHER KIND OF SERVICE IF YOU WILL AND A SERVICE I WILL THANKFULLY ACCEPT OF I BEGGED MRS MICAWBER TO NAME IT I HAVE PARTED WITH THE PLATE MYSELF SAID MRS MICAWBER SIX TEA TWO SALT AND A PAIR OF SUGARS I HAVE AT DIFFERENT TIMES BORROWED MONEY ON IN SECRET WITH MY OWN HANDS BUT THE TWINS ARE A GREAT TIE AND TO ME WITH MY RECOLLECTIONS OF PAPA AND MAMA THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE VERY PAINFUL THERE ARE STILL A FEW TRIFLES THAT WE COULD PART WITH MR MICAWBERS FEELINGS WOULD NEVER ALLOW HIM TO DISPOSE OF THEM AND CLICKETTTHIS WAS THE GIRL FROM THE WORKHOUSEBEING OF A VULGAR MIND WOULD TAKE PAINFUL LIBERTIES IF SO MUCH CONFIDENCE WAS REPOSED IN HER MASTER COPPERFIELD IF I MIGHT ASK YOU I UNDERSTOOD MRS MICAWBER NOW AND BEGGED HER TO MAKE USE OF ME TO ANY EXTENT I BEGAN TO DISPOSE OF THE MORE PORTABLE ARTICLES OF PROPERTY THAT VERY EVENING AND WENT OUT ON A SIMILAR EXPEDITION ALMOST EVERY MORNING BEFORE I WENT TO MURDSTONE AND GRINBYS MR MICAWBER HAD A FEW BOOKS ON A LITTLE CHIFFONIER WHICH HE CALLED THE LIBRARY AND THOSE WENT FIRST I CARRIED THEM ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO A BOOKSTALL IN THE CITY ROADONE PART OF WHICH NEAR OUR HOUSE WAS ALMOST ALL BOOKSTALLS AND BIRD SHOPS THENAND SOLD THEM FOR WHATEVER THEY WOULD BRING THE KEEPER OF THIS BOOKSTALL WHO LIVED IN A LITTLE HOUSE BEHIND IT USED TO GET TIPSY EVERY NIGHT AND TO BE VIOLENTLY SCOLDED BY HIS WIFE EVERY MORNING MORE THAN ONCE WHEN I WENT THERE EARLY I HAD AUDIENCE OF HIM IN A TURNUP BEDSTEAD WITH A CUT IN HIS FOREHEAD OR A BLACK EYE BEARING WITNESS TO HIS EXCESSES OVERNIGHT I AM AFRAID HE WAS QUARRELSOME IN HIS DRINK AND HE WITH A SHAKING HAND ENDEAVOURING TO FIND THE NEEDFUL SHILLINGS IN ONE OR OTHER OF THE POCKETS OF HIS CLOTHES WHICH LAY UPON THE FLOOR WHILE HIS WIFE WITH A BABY IN HER ARMS AND HER SHOES DOWN AT HEEL NEVER LEFT OFF RATING HIM SOMETIMES HE HAD LOST HIS MONEY AND THEN HE WOULD ASK ME TO CALL AGAIN BUT HIS WIFE HAD ALWAYS GOT SOMEHAD TAKEN HIS I DARE SAY WHILE HE WAS DRUNKAND SECRETLY COMPLETED THE BARGAIN ON THE STAIRS AS WE WENT DOWN TOGETHER AT THE PAWNBROKERS SHOP TOO I BEGAN TO BE VERY WELL KNOWN THE PRINCIPAL GENTLEMAN WHO OFFICIATED BEHIND THE COUNTER TOOK A GOOD DEAL OF NOTICE OF ME AND OFTEN GOT ME I RECOLLECT TO DECLINE A LATIN NOUN OR ADJECTIVE OR TO CONJUGATE A LATIN VERB IN HIS EAR WHILE HE TRANSACTED MY BUSINESS AFTER ALL THESE OCCASIONS MRS MICAWBER MADE A LITTLE TREAT WHICH WAS GENERALLY A SUPPER AND THERE WAS A PECULIAR RELISH IN THESE MEALS WHICH I WELL REMEMBER AT LAST MR MICAWBERS DIFFICULTIES CAME TO A CRISIS AND HE WAS ARRESTED EARLY ONE MORNING AND CARRIED OVER TO THE KINGS BENCH PRISON IN THE BOROUGH HE TOLD ME AS HE WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE THAT THE GOD OF DAY HAD NOW GONE DOWN UPON HIMAND I REALLY THOUGHT HIS HEART WAS BROKEN AND MINE TOO BUT I HEARD AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS SEEN TO PLAY A LIVELY GAME AT SKITTLES BEFORE NOON ON THE FIRST SUNDAY AFTER HE WAS TAKEN THERE I WAS TO GO AND SEE HIM AND HAVE DINNER WITH HIM I WAS TO ASK MY WAY TO SUCH A PLACE AND JUST SHORT OF THAT PLACE I SHOULD SEE SUCH ANOTHER PLACE AND JUST SHORT OF THAT I SHOULD SEE A YARD WHICH I WAS TO CROSS AND KEEP STRAIGHT ON UNTIL I SAW A TURNKEY ALL THIS I DID AND WHEN AT LAST I DID SEE A TURNKEY POOR LITTLE FELLOW THAT I WAS AND THOUGHT HOW WHEN RODERICK RANDOM WAS IN A DEBTORS PRISON THERE WAS A MAN THERE WITH NOTHING ON HIM BUT AN OLD RUG THE TURNKEY SWAM BEFORE MY DIMMED EYES AND MY BEATING HEART MR MICAWBER WAS WAITING FOR ME WITHIN THE GATE AND WE WENT UP TO HIS ROOM TOP STORY BUT ONE AND CRIED VERY MUCH HE SOLEMNLY CONJURED ME I REMEMBER TO TAKE WARNING BY HIS FATE AND TO OBSERVE THAT IF A MAN HAD TWENTY POUNDS AYEAR FOR HIS INCOME AND SPENT NINETEEN POUNDS NINETEEN SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE HE WOULD BE HAPPY BUT THAT IF HE SPENT TWENTY POUNDS ONE HE WOULD BE MISERABLE AFTER WHICH HE BORROWED A SHILLING OF ME FOR PORTER GAVE ME A WRITTEN ORDER ON MRS MICAWBER FOR THE AMOUNT AND PUT AWAY HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF AND CHEERED UP WE SAT BEFORE A LITTLE FIRE WITH TWO BRICKS PUT WITHIN THE RUSTED GRATE ONE ON EACH SIDE TO PREVENT ITS BURNING TOO MANY COALS UNTIL ANOTHER DEBTOR WHO SHARED THE ROOM WITH MR MICAWBER CAME IN FROM THE BAKEHOUSE WITH THE LOIN OF MUTTON WHICH WAS OUR JOINTSTOCK REPAST THEN I WAS SENT UP TO CAPTAIN HOPKINS IN THE ROOM OVERHEAD WITH MR MICAWBERS COMPLIMENTS AND I WAS HIS YOUNG FRIEND AND WOULD CAPTAIN HOPKINS LEND ME A KNIFE AND FORK CAPTAIN HOPKINS LENT ME THE KNIFE AND FORK WITH HIS COMPLIMENTS TO MR MICAWBER THERE WAS A VERY DIRTY LADY IN HIS LITTLE ROOM AND TWO WAN GIRLS HIS DAUGHTERS WITH SHOCK HEADS OF HAIR I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER TO BORROW CAPTAIN HOPKINSS KNIFE AND FORK THAN CAPTAIN HOPKINSS COMB THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF WAS IN THE LAST EXTREMITY OF SHABBINESS WITH LARGE WHISKERS AND AN OLD OLD BROWN GREATCOAT WITH NO OTHER COAT BELOW IT I SAW HIS BED ROLLED UP IN A CORNER AND WHAT PLATES AND DISHES AND POTS HE HAD ON A SHELF AND I DIVINED GOD KNOWS HOW THAT THOUGH THE TWO GIRLS WITH THE SHOCK HEADS OF HAIR WERE CAPTAIN HOPKINSS CHILDREN THE DIRTY LADY WAS NOT MARRIED TO CAPTAIN HOPKINS MY TIMID STATION ON HIS THRESHOLD WAS NOT OCCUPIED MORE THAN A COUPLE OF MINUTES AT MOST BUT I CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH ALL THIS IN MY KNOWLEDGE AS SURELY AS THE KNIFE AND FORK WERE IN MY HAND THERE WAS SOMETHING GIPSYLIKE AND AGREEABLE IN THE DINNER AFTER ALL I TOOK BACK CAPTAIN HOPKINSS KNIFE AND FORK EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND WENT HOME TO COMFORT MRS MICAWBER WITH AN ACCOUNT OF MY VISIT SHE FAINTED WHEN SHE SAW ME RETURN AND MADE A LITTLE JUG OF EGGHOT AFTERWARDS TO CONSOLE US WHILE WE TALKED IT OVER I DONT KNOW HOW THE HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE CAME TO BE SOLD FOR THE FAMILY BENEFIT OR WHO SOLD IT EXCEPT THAT I DID NOT SOLD IT WAS HOWEVER AND CARRIED AWAY IN A VAN EXCEPT THE BED A FEW CHAIRS AND THE KITCHEN TABLE WITH THESE POSSESSIONS WE ENCAMPED AS IT WERE IN THE TWO PARLOURS OF THE EMPTIED HOUSE IN WINDSOR TERRACE MRS MICAWBER THE CHILDREN THE ORFLING AND MYSELF AND LIVED IN THOSE ROOMS NIGHT AND DAY I HAVE NO IDEA FOR HOW LONG THOUGH IT SEEMS TO ME FOR A LONG TIME AT LAST MRS MICAWBER RESOLVED TO MOVE INTO THE PRISON WHERE MR MICAWBER HAD NOW SECURED A ROOM TO HIMSELF SO I TOOK THE KEY OF THE HOUSE TO THE LANDLORD WHO WAS VERY GLAD TO GET IT AND THE BEDS WERE SENT OVER TO THE KINGS BENCH EXCEPT MINE FOR WHICH A LITTLE ROOM WAS HIRED OUTSIDE THE WALLS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THAT INSTITUTION VERY MUCH TO MY SATISFACTION SINCE THE MICAWBERS AND I HAD BECOME TOO USED TO ONE ANOTHER IN OUR TROUBLES TO PART THE ORFLING WAS LIKEWISE ACCOMMODATED WITH AN INEXPENSIVE LODGING IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD MINE WAS A QUIET BACKGARRET WITH A SLOPING ROOF COMMANDING A PLEASANT PROSPECT OF A TIMBERYARD AND WHEN I TOOK POSSESSION OF IT WITH THE REFLECTION THAT MR MICAWBERS TROUBLES HAD COME TO A CRISIS AT LAST I THOUGHT IT QUITE A PARADISE ALL THIS TIME I WAS WORKING AT MURDSTONE AND GRINBYS IN THE SAME COMMON WAY AND WITH THE SAME COMMON COMPANIONS AND WITH THE SAME SENSE OF UNMERITED DEGRADATION AS AT FIRST BUT I NEVER HAPPILY FOR ME NO DOUBT MADE A SINGLE ACQUAINTANCE OR SPOKE TO ANY OF THE MANY BOYS WHOM I SAW DAILY IN GOING TO THE WAREHOUSE IN COMING FROM IT AND IN PROWLING ABOUT THE STREETS AT MEALTIMES I LED THE SAME SECRETLY UNHAPPY LIFE BUT I LED IT IN THE SAME LONELY SELFRELIANT MANNER THE ONLY CHANGES I AM CONSCIOUS OF ARE FIRSTLY THAT I HAD GROWN MORE SHABBY AND SECONDLY THAT I WAS NOW RELIEVED OF MUCH OF THE WEIGHT OF MR AND MRS MICAWBERS CARES FOR SOME RELATIVES OR FRIENDS HAD ENGAGED TO HELP THEM AT THEIR PRESENT PASS AND THEY LIVED MORE COMFORTABLY IN THE PRISON THAN THEY HAD LIVED FOR A LONG WHILE OUT OF IT I USED TO BREAKFAST WITH THEM NOW IN VIRTUE OF SOME ARRANGEMENT OF WHICH I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE DETAILS I FORGET TOO AT WHAT HOUR THE GATES WERE OPENED IN THE MORNING ADMITTING OF MY GOING IN BUT I KNOW THAT I WAS OFTEN UP AT SIX OCLOCK AND THAT MY FAVOURITE LOUNGINGPLACE IN THE INTERVAL WAS OLD LONDON BRIDGE WHERE I WAS WONT TO SIT IN ONE OF THE STONE RECESSES WATCHING THE PEOPLE GOING BY OR TO LOOK OVER THE BALUSTRADES AT THE SUN SHINING IN THE WATER AND LIGHTING UP THE GOLDEN FLAME ON THE TOP OF THE MONUMENT THE ORFLING MET ME HERE SOMETIMES TO BE TOLD SOME ASTONISHING FICTIONS RESPECTING THE WHARVES AND THE TOWER OF WHICH I CAN SAY NO MORE THAN THAT I HOPE I BELIEVED THEM MYSELF IN THE EVENING I USED TO GO BACK TO THE PRISON AND WALK UP AND DOWN THE PARADE WITH MR MICAWBER OR PLAY CASINO WITH MRS MICAWBER AND HEAR REMINISCENCES OF HER PAPA AND MAMA WHETHER MR MURDSTONE KNEW WHERE I WAS I AM UNABLE TO SAY I NEVER TOLD THEM AT MURDSTONE AND GRINBYS MR MICAWBERS AFFAIRS ALTHOUGH PAST THEIR CRISIS WERE VERY MUCH INVOLVED BY REASON OF A CERTAIN DEED OF WHICH I USED TO HEAR A GREAT DEAL AND WHICH I SUPPOSE NOW TO HAVE BEEN SOME FORMER COMPOSITION WITH HIS CREDITORS THOUGH I WAS SO FAR FROM BEING CLEAR ABOUT IT THEN THAT I AM CONSCIOUS OF HAVING CONFOUNDED IT WITH THOSE DEMONIACAL PARCHMENTS WHICH ARE HELD TO HAVE ONCE UPON A TIME OBTAINED TO A GREAT EXTENT IN GERMANY AT LAST THIS DOCUMENT APPEARED TO BE GOT OUT OF THE WAY SOMEHOW AT ALL EVENTS IT CEASED TO BE THE ROCKAHEAD IT HAD BEEN AND MRS MICAWBER INFORMED ME THAT HER FAMILY HAD DECIDED THAT MR MICAWBER SHOULD APPLY FOR HIS RELEASE UNDER THE INSOLVENT DEBTORS ACT WHICH WOULD SET HIM FREE SHE EXPECTED IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS AND THEN SAID MR MICAWBER WHO WAS PRESENT I HAVE NO DOUBT I SHALL PLEASE HEAVEN BEGIN TO BE BEFOREHAND WITH THE WORLD AND TO LIVE IN A PERFECTLY NEW MANNER IFIN SHORT IF ANYTHING TURNS UP BY WAY OF GOING IN FOR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE ON THE CARDS I CALL TO MIND THAT MR MICAWBER ABOUT THIS TIME COMPOSED A PETITION TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS PRAYING FOR AN ALTERATION IN THE LAW OF IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT I SET DOWN THIS REMEMBRANCE HERE BECAUSE IT IS AN INSTANCE TO MYSELF OF THE MANNER IN WHICH I FITTED MY OLD BOOKS TO MY ALTERED LIFE AND MADE STORIES FOR MYSELF OUT OF THE STREETS AND OUT OF MEN AND WOMEN AND HOW SOME MAIN POINTS IN THE CHARACTER I SHALL UNCONSCIOUSLY DEVELOP I SUPPOSE IN WRITING MY LIFE WERE GRADUALLY FORMING ALL THIS WHILE THERE WAS A CLUB IN THE PRISON IN WHICH MR MICAWBER AS A GENTLEMAN WAS A GREAT AUTHORITY MR MICAWBER HAD STATED HIS IDEA OF THIS PETITION TO THE CLUB AND THE CLUB HAD STRONGLY APPROVED OF THE SAME WHEREFORE MR MICAWBER WHO WAS A THOROUGHLY GOODNATURED MAN AND AS ACTIVE A CREATURE ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT HIS OWN AFFAIRS AS EVER EXISTED AND NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN HE WAS BUSY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COULD NEVER BE OF ANY PROFIT TO HIM SET TO WORK AT THE PETITION INVENTED IT ENGROSSED IT ON AN IMMENSE SHEET OF PAPER SPREAD IT OUT ON A TABLE AND APPOINTED A TIME FOR ALL THE CLUB AND ALL WITHIN THE WALLS IF THEY CHOSE TO COME UP TO HIS ROOM AND SIGN IT WHEN I HEARD OF THIS APPROACHING CEREMONY I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE THEM ALL COME IN ONE AFTER ANOTHER THOUGH I KNEW THE GREATER PART OF THEM ALREADY AND THEY ME THAT I GOT AN HOURS LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM MURDSTONE AND GRINBYS AND ESTABLISHED MYSELF IN A CORNER FOR THAT PURPOSE AS MANY OF THE PRINCIPAL MEMBERS OF THE CLUB AS COULD BE GOT INTO THE SMALL ROOM WITHOUT FILLING IT SUPPORTED MR MICAWBER IN FRONT OF THE PETITION WHILE MY OLD FRIEND CAPTAIN HOPKINS WHO HAD WASHED HIMSELF TO DO HONOUR TO SO SOLEMN AN OCCASION STATIONED HIMSELF CLOSE TO IT TO READ IT TO ALL WHO WERE UNACQUAINTED WITH ITS CONTENTS THE DOOR WAS THEN THROWN OPEN AND THE GENERAL POPULATION BEGAN TO COME IN IN A LONG FILE SEVERAL WAITING OUTSIDE WHILE ONE ENTERED AFFIXED HIS SIGNATURE AND WENT OUT TO EVERYBODY IN SUCCESSION CAPTAIN HOPKINS SAID HAVE YOU READ ITNOWOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR IT READ IF HE WEAKLY SHOWED THE LEAST DISPOSITION TO HEAR IT CAPTAIN HOPKINS IN A LOUD SONOROUS VOICE GAVE HIM EVERY WORD OF IT THE CAPTAIN WOULD HAVE READ IT TWENTY THOUSAND TIMES IF TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HEARD HIM ONE BY ONE I REMEMBER A CERTAIN LUSCIOUS ROLL HE GAVE TO SUCH PHRASES AS THE PEOPLES REPRESENTATIVES IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED YOUR PETITIONERS THEREFORE HUMBLY APPROACH YOUR HONOURABLE HOUSE HIS GRACIOUS MAJESTYS UNFORTUNATE SUBJECTS AS IF THE WORDS WERE SOMETHING REAL IN HIS MOUTH AND DELICIOUS TO TASTE MR MICAWBER MEANWHILE LISTENING WITH A LITTLE OF AN AUTHORS VANITY AND CONTEMPLATING NOT SEVERELY THE SPIKES ON THE OPPOSITE WALL AS I WALKED TO AND FRO DAILY BETWEEN SOUTHWARK AND BLACKFRIARS AND LOUNGED ABOUT AT MEALTIMES IN OBSCURE STREETS THE STONES OF WHICH MAY FOR ANYTHING I KNOW BE WORN AT THIS MOMENT BY MY CHILDISH FEET I WONDER HOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WERE WANTING IN THE CROWD THAT USED TO COME FILING BEFORE ME IN REVIEW AGAIN TO THE ECHO OF CAPTAIN HOPKINSS VOICE WHEN MY THOUGHTS GO BACK NOW TO THAT SLOW AGONY OF MY YOUTH I WONDER HOW MUCH OF THE HISTORIES I INVENTED FOR SUCH PEOPLE HANGS LIKE A MIST OF FANCY OVER WELLREMEMBERED FACTS WHEN I TREAD THE OLD GROUND I DO NOT WONDER THAT I SEEM TO SEE AND PITY GOING ON BEFORE ME AN INNOCENT ROMANTIC BOY MAKING HIS IMAGINATIVE WORLD OUT OF SUCH STRANGE EXPERIENCES AND SORDID THINGS CHAPTER LIKING LIFE ON MY OWN ACCOUNT NO BETTER I FORM A GREAT RESOLUTION IN DUE TIME MR MICAWBERS PETITION WAS RIPE FOR HEARING AND THAT GENTLEMAN WAS ORDERED TO BE DISCHARGED UNDER THE ACT TO MY GREAT JOY HIS CREDITORS WERE NOT IMPLACABLE AND MRS MICAWBER INFORMED ME THAT EVEN THE REVENGEFUL BOOTMAKER HAD DECLARED IN OPEN COURT THAT HE BORE HIM NO MALICE BUT THAT WHEN MONEY WAS OWING TO HIM HE LIKED TO BE PAID HE SAID HE THOUGHT IT WAS HUMAN NATURE MR MICAWBER RETURNED TO THE KINGS BENCH WHEN HIS CASE WAS OVER AS SOME FEES WERE TO BE SETTLED AND SOME FORMALITIES OBSERVED BEFORE HE COULD BE ACTUALLY RELEASED THE CLUB RECEIVED HIM WITH TRANSPORT AND HELD AN HARMONIC MEETING THAT EVENING IN HIS HONOUR WHILE MRS MICAWBER AND I HAD A LAMBS FRY IN PRIVATE SURROUNDED BY THE SLEEPING FAMILY ON SUCH AN OCCASION I WILL GIVE YOU MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID MRS MICAWBER IN A LITTLE MORE FLIP FOR WE HAD BEEN HAVING SOME ALREADY THE MEMORY OF MY PAPA AND MAMA ARE THEY DEAD MAAM I INQUIRED AFTER DRINKING THE TOAST IN A WINEGLASS MY MAMA DEPARTED THIS LIFE SAID MRS MICAWBER BEFORE MR MICAWBERS DIFFICULTIES COMMENCED OR AT LEAST BEFORE THEY BECAME PRESSING MY PAPA LIVED TO BAIL MR MICAWBER SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN EXPIRED REGRETTED BY A NUMEROUS CIRCLE MRS MICAWBER SHOOK HER HEAD AND DROPPED A PIOUS TEAR UPON THE TWIN WHO HAPPENED TO BE IN HAND AS I COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING A QUESTION IN WHICH I HAD A NEAR INTEREST I SAID TO MRS MICAWBER MAY I ASK MAAM WHAT YOU AND MR MICAWBER INTEND TO DO NOW THAT MR MICAWBER IS OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES AND AT LIBERTY HAVE YOU SETTLED YET MY FAMILY SAID MRS MICAWBER WHO ALWAYS SAID THOSE TWO WORDS WITH AN AIR THOUGH I NEVER COULD DISCOVER WHO CAME UNDER THE DENOMINATION MY FAMILY ARE OF OPINION THAT MR MICAWBER SHOULD QUIT LONDON AND EXERT HIS TALENTS IN THE COUNTRY MR MICAWBER IS A MAN OF GREAT TALENT MASTER COPPERFIELD I SAID I WAS SURE OF THAT OF GREAT TALENT REPEATED MRS MICAWBER MY FAMILY ARE OF OPINION THAT WITH A LITTLE INTEREST SOMETHING MIGHT BE DONE FOR A MAN OF HIS ABILITY IN THE CUSTOM HOUSE THE INFLUENCE OF MY FAMILY BEING LOCAL IT IS THEIR WISH THAT MR MICAWBER SHOULD GO DOWN TO PLYMOUTH THEY THINK IT INDISPENSABLE THAT HE SHOULD BE UPON THE SPOT THAT HE MAY BE READY I SUGGESTED EXACTLY RETURNED MRS MICAWBER THAT HE MAY BE READYIN CASE OF ANYTHING TURNING UP AND DO YOU GO TOO MAAM THE EVENTS OF THE DAY IN COMBINATION WITH THE TWINS IF NOT WITH THE FLIP HAD MADE MRS MICAWBER HYSTERICAL AND SHE SHED TEARS AS SHE REPLIED I NEVER WILL DESERT MR MICAWBER MR MICAWBER MAY HAVE CONCEALED HIS DIFFICULTIES FROM ME IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BUT HIS SANGUINE TEMPER MAY HAVE LED HIM TO EXPECT THAT HE WOULD OVERCOME THEM THE PEARL NECKLACE AND BRACELETS WHICH I INHERITED FROM MAMA HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF FOR LESS THAN HALF THEIR VALUE AND THE SET OF CORAL WHICH WAS THE WEDDING GIFT OF MY PAPA HAS BEEN ACTUALLY THROWN AWAY FOR NOTHING BUT I NEVER WILL DESERT MR MICAWBER NO CRIED MRS MICAWBER MORE AFFECTED THAN BEFORE I NEVER WILL DO IT ITS OF NO USE ASKING ME I FELT QUITE UNCOMFORTABLEAS IF MRS MICAWBER SUPPOSED I HAD ASKED HER TO DO ANYTHING OF THE SORTAND SAT LOOKING AT HER IN ALARM MR MICAWBER HAS HIS FAULTS I DO NOT DENY THAT HE IS IMPROVIDENT I DO NOT DENY THAT HE HAS KEPT ME IN THE DARK AS TO HIS RESOURCES AND HIS LIABILITIES BOTH SHE WENT ON LOOKING AT THE WALL BUT I NEVER WILL DESERT MR MICAWBER MRS MICAWBER HAVING NOW RAISED HER VOICE INTO A PERFECT SCREAM I WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT I RAN OFF TO THE CLUBROOM AND DISTURBED MR MICAWBER IN THE ACT OF PRESIDING AT A LONG TABLE AND LEADING THE CHORUS OF GEE UP DOBBIN GEE HO DOBBIN GEE UP DOBBIN GEE UP AND GEE HOOO WITH THE TIDINGS THAT MRS MICAWBER WAS IN AN ALARMING STATE UPON WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY BURST INTO TEARS AND CAME AWAY WITH ME WITH HIS WAISTCOAT FULL OF THE HEADS AND TAILS OF SHRIMPS OF WHICH HE HAD BEEN PARTAKING EMMA MY ANGEL CRIED MR MICAWBER RUNNING INTO THE ROOM WHAT IS THE MATTER I NEVER WILL DESERT YOU MICAWBER SHE EXCLAIMED MY LIFE SAID MR MICAWBER TAKING HER IN HIS ARMS I AM PERFECTLY AWARE OF IT HE IS THE PARENT OF MY CHILDREN HE IS THE FATHER OF MY TWINS HE IS THE HUSBAND OF MY AFFECTIONS CRIED MRS MICAWBER STRUGGLING AND I NEVERWILLDESERT MR MICAWBER MR MICAWBER WAS SO DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THIS PROOF OF HER DEVOTION AS TO ME I WAS DISSOLVED IN TEARS THAT HE HUNG OVER HER IN A PASSIONATE MANNER IMPLORING HER TO LOOK UP AND TO BE CALM BUT THE MORE HE ASKED MRS MICAWBER TO LOOK UP THE MORE SHE FIXED HER EYES ON NOTHING AND THE MORE HE ASKED HER TO COMPOSE HERSELF THE MORE SHE WOULDNT CONSEQUENTLY MR MICAWBER WAS SOON SO OVERCOME THAT HE MINGLED HIS TEARS WITH HERS AND MINE UNTIL HE BEGGED ME TO DO HIM THE FAVOUR OF TAKING A CHAIR ON THE STAIRCASE WHILE HE GOT HER INTO BED I WOULD HAVE TAKEN MY LEAVE FOR THE NIGHT BUT HE WOULD NOT HEAR OF MY DOING THAT UNTIL THE STRANGERS BELL SHOULD RING SO I SAT AT THE STAIRCASE WINDOW UNTIL HE CAME OUT WITH ANOTHER CHAIR AND JOINED ME HOW IS MRS MICAWBER NOW SIR I SAID VERY LOW SAID MR MICAWBER SHAKING HIS HEAD REACTION AH THIS HAS BEEN A DREADFUL DAY WE STAND ALONE NOWEVERYTHING IS GONE FROM US MR MICAWBER PRESSED MY HAND AND GROANED AND AFTERWARDS SHED TEARS I WAS GREATLY TOUCHED AND DISAPPOINTED TOO FOR I HAD EXPECTED THAT WE SHOULD BE QUITE GAY ON THIS HAPPY AND LONGLOOKEDFOR OCCASION BUT MR AND MRS MICAWBER WERE SO USED TO THEIR OLD DIFFICULTIES I THINK THAT THEY FELT QUITE SHIPWRECKED WHEN THEY CAME TO CONSIDER THAT THEY WERE RELEASED FROM THEM ALL THEIR ELASTICITY WAS DEPARTED AND I NEVER SAW THEM HALF SO WRETCHED AS ON THIS NIGHT INSOMUCH THAT WHEN THE BELL RANG AND MR MICAWBER WALKED WITH ME TO THE LODGE AND PARTED FROM ME THERE WITH A BLESSING I FELT QUITE AFRAID TO LEAVE HIM BY HIMSELF HE WAS SO PROFOUNDLY MISERABLE BUT THROUGH ALL THE CONFUSION AND LOWNESS OF SPIRITS IN WHICH WE HAD BEEN SO UNEXPECTEDLY TO ME INVOLVED I PLAINLY DISCERNED THAT MR AND MRS MICAWBER AND THEIR FAMILY WERE GOING AWAY FROM LONDON AND THAT A PARTING BETWEEN US WAS NEAR AT HAND IT WAS IN MY WALK HOME THAT NIGHT AND IN THE SLEEPLESS HOURS WHICH FOLLOWED WHEN I LAY IN BED THAT THE THOUGHT FIRST OCCURRED TO METHOUGH I DONT KNOW HOW IT CAME INTO MY HEADWHICH AFTERWARDS SHAPED ITSELF INTO A SETTLED RESOLUTION I HAD GROWN TO BE SO ACCUSTOMED TO THE MICAWBERS AND HAD BEEN SO INTIMATE WITH THEM IN THEIR DISTRESSES AND WAS SO UTTERLY FRIENDLESS WITHOUT THEM THAT THE PROSPECT OF BEING THROWN UPON SOME NEW SHIFT FOR A LODGING AND GOING ONCE MORE AMONG UNKNOWN PEOPLE WAS LIKE BEING THAT MOMENT TURNED ADRIFT INTO MY PRESENT LIFE WITH SUCH A KNOWLEDGE OF IT READY MADE AS EXPERIENCE HAD GIVEN ME ALL THE SENSITIVE FEELINGS IT WOUNDED SO CRUELLY ALL THE SHAME AND MISERY IT KEPT ALIVE WITHIN MY BREAST BECAME MORE POIGNANT AS I THOUGHT OF THIS AND I DETERMINED THAT THE LIFE WAS UNENDURABLE THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE OF ESCAPE FROM IT UNLESS THE ESCAPE WAS MY OWN ACT I KNEW QUITE WELL I RARELY HEARD FROM MISS MURDSTONE AND NEVER FROM MR MURDSTONE BUT TWO OR THREE PARCELS OF MADE OR MENDED CLOTHES HAD COME UP FOR ME CONSIGNED TO MR QUINION AND IN EACH THERE WAS A SCRAP OF PAPER TO THE EFFECT THAT J M TRUSTED D C WAS APPLYING HIMSELF TO BUSINESS AND DEVOTING HIMSELF WHOLLY TO HIS DUTIESNOT THE LEAST HINT OF MY EVER BEING ANYTHING ELSE THAN THE COMMON DRUDGE INTO WHICH I WAS FAST SETTLING DOWN THE VERY NEXT DAY SHOWED ME WHILE MY MIND WAS IN THE FIRST AGITATION OF WHAT IT HAD CONCEIVED THAT MRS MICAWBER HAD NOT SPOKEN OF THEIR GOING AWAY WITHOUT WARRANT THEY TOOK A LODGING IN THE HOUSE WHERE I LIVED FOR A WEEK AT THE EXPIRATION OF WHICH TIME THEY WERE TO START FOR PLYMOUTH MR MICAWBER HIMSELF CAME DOWN TO THE COUNTINGHOUSE IN THE AFTERNOON TO TELL MR QUINION THAT HE MUST RELINQUISH ME ON THE DAY OF HIS DEPARTURE AND TO GIVE ME A HIGH CHARACTER WHICH I AM SURE I DESERVED AND MR QUINION CALLING IN TIPP THE CARMAN WHO WAS A MARRIED MAN AND HAD A ROOM TO LET QUARTERED ME PROSPECTIVELY ON HIMBY OUR MUTUAL CONSENT AS HE HAD EVERY REASON TO THINK FOR I SAID NOTHING THOUGH MY RESOLUTION WAS NOW TAKEN I PASSED MY EVENINGS WITH MR AND MRS MICAWBER DURING THE REMAINING TERM OF OUR RESIDENCE UNDER THE SAME ROOF AND I THINK WE BECAME FONDER OF ONE ANOTHER AS THE TIME WENT ON ON THE LAST SUNDAY THEY INVITED ME TO DINNER AND WE HAD A LOIN OF PORK AND APPLE SAUCE AND A PUDDING I HAD BOUGHT A SPOTTED WOODEN HORSE OVERNIGHT AS A PARTING GIFT TO LITTLE WILKINS MICAWBERTHAT WAS THE BOYAND A DOLL FOR LITTLE EMMA I HAD ALSO BESTOWED A SHILLING ON THE ORFLING WHO WAS ABOUT TO BE DISBANDED WE HAD A VERY PLEASANT DAY THOUGH WE WERE ALL IN A TENDER STATE ABOUT OUR APPROACHING SEPARATION I SHALL NEVER MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID MRS MICAWBER REVERT TO THE PERIOD WHEN MR MICAWBER WAS IN DIFFICULTIES WITHOUT THINKING OF YOU YOUR CONDUCT HAS ALWAYS BEEN OF THE MOST DELICATE AND OBLIGING DESCRIPTION YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN A LODGER YOU HAVE BEEN A FRIEND MY DEAR SAID MR MICAWBER COPPERFIELD FOR SO HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO CALL ME OF LATE HAS A HEART TO FEEL FOR THE DISTRESSES OF HIS FELLOWCREATURES WHEN THEY ARE BEHIND A CLOUD AND A HEAD TO PLAN AND A HAND TOIN SHORT A GENERAL ABILITY TO DISPOSE OF SUCH AVAILABLE PROPERTY AS COULD BE MADE AWAY WITH I EXPRESSED MY SENSE OF THIS COMMENDATION AND SAID I WAS VERY SORRY WE WERE GOING TO LOSE ONE ANOTHER MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND SAID MR MICAWBER I AM OLDER THAN YOU A MAN OF SOME EXPERIENCE IN LIFE ANDAND OF SOME EXPERIENCE IN SHORT IN DIFFICULTIES GENERALLY SPEAKING AT PRESENT AND UNTIL SOMETHING TURNS UP WHICH I AM I MAY SAY HOURLY EXPECTING I HAVE NOTHING TO BESTOW BUT ADVICE STILL MY ADVICE IS SO FAR WORTH TAKING THATIN SHORT THAT I HAVE NEVER TAKEN IT MYSELF AND AM THEHERE MR MICAWBER WHO HAD BEEN BEAMING AND SMILING ALL OVER HIS HEAD AND FACE UP TO THE PRESENT MOMENT CHECKED HIMSELF AND FROWNEDTHE MISERABLE WRETCH YOU BEHOLD MY DEAR MICAWBER URGED HIS WIFE I SAY RETURNED MR MICAWBER QUITE FORGETTING HIMSELF AND SMILING AGAIN THE MISERABLE WRETCH YOU BEHOLD MY ADVICE IS NEVER DO TOMORROW WHAT YOU CAN DO TODAY PROCRASTINATION IS THE THIEF OF TIME COLLAR HIM MY POOR PAPAS MAXIM MRS MICAWBER OBSERVED MY DEAR SAID MR MICAWBER YOUR

THE SAME LEGS FOR GAITERS AND ABLE TO READ THE SAME DESCRIPTION OF PRINT WITHOUT SPECTACLES BUT HE APPLIED THAT MAXIM TO OUR MARRIAGE MY DEAR AND THAT WAS SO FAR PREMATURELY ENTERED INTO IN CONSEQUENCE THAT I NEVER RECOVERED THE EXPENSE MR MICAWBER LOOKED ASIDE AT MRS MICAWBER AND ADDED NOT THAT I AM SORRY FOR IT QUITE THE CONTRARY MY LOVE AFTER WHICH HE WAS GRAVE FOR A MINUTE OR SO MY OTHER PIECE OF ADVICE COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER YOU KNOW ANNUAL INCOME TWENTY POUNDS ANNUAL EXPENDITURE NINETEEN NINETEEN AND SIX RESULT HAPPINESS ANNUAL INCOME TWENTY POUNDS ANNUAL EXPENDITURE TWENTY POUNDS OUGHT AND SIX RESULT MISERY THE BLOSSOM IS BLIGHTED THE LEAF IS WITHERED THE GOD OF DAY GOES DOWN UPON THE DREARY SCENE ANDAND IN SHORT YOU ARE FOR EVER FLOORED AS I AM TO MAKE HIS EXAMPLE THE MORE IMPRESSIVE MR MICAWBER DRANK A GLASS OF PUNCH WITH AN AIR OF GREAT ENJOYMENT AND SATISFACTION AND WHISTLED THE COLLEGE HORNPIPE I DID NOT FAIL TO ASSURE HIM THAT I WOULD STORE THESE PRECEPTS IN MY MIND THOUGH INDEED I HAD NO NEED TO DO SO FOR AT THE TIME THEY AFFECTED ME VISIBLY NEXT MORNING I MET THE WHOLE FAMILY AT THE COACH OFFICE AND SAW THEM WITH A DESOLATE HEART TAKE THEIR PLACES OUTSIDE AT THE BACK MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID MRS MICAWBER GOD BLESS YOU I NEVER CAN FORGET ALL THAT YOU KNOW AND I NEVER WOULD IF I COULD COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER FAREWELL EVERY HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY IF IN THE PROGRESS OF REVOLVING YEARS I COULD PERSUADE MYSELF THAT MY BLIGHTED DESTINY HAD BEEN A WARNING TO YOU I SHOULD FEEL THAT I HAD NOT OCCUPIED ANOTHER MANS PLACE IN EXISTENCE ALTOGETHER IN VAIN IN CASE OF ANYTHING TURNING UP OF WHICH I AM RATHER CONFIDENT I SHALL BE EXTREMELY HAPPY IF IT SHOULD BE IN MY POWER TO IMPROVE YOUR PROSPECTS I THINK AS MRS MICAWBER SAT AT THE BACK OF THE COACH WITH THE CHILDREN AND I STOOD IN THE ROAD LOOKING WISTFULLY AT THEM A MIST CLEARED FROM HER EYES AND SHE SAW WHAT A LITTLE CREATURE I REALLY WAS I THINK SO BECAUSE SHE BECKONED TO ME TO CLIMB UP WITH QUITE A NEW AND MOTHERLY EXPRESSION IN HER FACE AND PUT HER ARM ROUND MY NECK AND GAVE ME JUST SUCH A KISS AS SHE MIGHT HAVE GIVEN TO HER OWN BOY I HAD BARELY TIME TO GET DOWN AGAIN BEFORE THE COACH STARTED AND I COULD HARDLY SEE THE FAMILY FOR THE HANDKERCHIEFS THEY WAVED IT WAS GONE IN A MINUTE THE ORFLING AND I STOOD LOOKING VACANTLY AT EACH OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND THEN SHOOK HANDS AND SAID GOODBYE SHE GOING BACK I SUPPOSE TO ST LUKES WORKHOUSE AS I WENT TO BEGIN MY WEARY DAY AT MURDSTONE AND GRINBYS BUT WITH NO INTENTION OF PASSING MANY MORE WEARY DAYS THERE NO I HAD RESOLVED TO RUN AWAYTO GO BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER DOWN INTO THE COUNTRY TO THE ONLY RELATION I HAD IN THE WORLD AND TELL MY STORY TO MY AUNT MISS BETSEY I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THAT I DONT KNOW HOW THIS DESPERATE IDEA CAME INTO MY BRAIN BUT ONCE THERE IT REMAINED THERE AND HARDENED INTO A PURPOSE THAN WHICH I HAVE NEVER ENTERTAINED A MORE DETERMINED PURPOSE IN MY LIFE I AM FAR FROM SURE THAT I BELIEVED THERE WAS ANYTHING HOPEFUL IN IT BUT MY MIND WAS THOROUGHLY MADE UP THAT IT MUST BE CARRIED INTO EXECUTION AGAIN AND AGAIN AND A HUNDRED TIMES AGAIN SINCE THE NIGHT WHEN THE THOUGHT HAD FIRST OCCURRED TO ME AND BANISHED SLEEP I HAD GONE OVER THAT OLD STORY OF MY POOR MOTHERS ABOUT MY BIRTH WHICH IT HAD BEEN ONE OF MY GREAT DELIGHTS IN THE OLD TIME TO HEAR HER TELL AND WHICH I KNEW BY HEART MY AUNT WALKED INTO THAT STORY AND WALKED OUT OF IT A DREAD AND AWFUL PERSONAGE BUT THERE WAS ONE LITTLE TRAIT IN HER BEHAVIOUR WHICH I LIKED TO DWELL ON AND WHICH GAVE ME SOME FAINT SHADOW OF ENCOURAGEMENT I COULD NOT FORGET HOW MY MOTHER HAD THOUGHT THAT SHE FELT HER TOUCH HER PRETTY HAIR WITH NO UNGENTLE HAND AND THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALTOGETHER MY MOTHERS FANCY AND MIGHT HAVE HAD NO FOUNDATION WHATEVER IN FACT I MADE A LITTLE PICTURE OUT OF IT OF MY TERRIBLE AUNT RELENTING TOWARDS THE GIRLISH BEAUTY THAT I RECOLLECTED SO WELL AND LOVED SO MUCH WHICH SOFTENED THE WHOLE NARRATIVE IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT IT HAD BEEN IN MY MIND A LONG TIME AND HAD GRADUALLY ENGENDERED MY DETERMINATION AS I DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHERE MISS BETSEY LIVED I WROTE A LONG LETTER TO PEGGOTTY AND ASKED HER INCIDENTALLY IF SHE REMEMBERED PRETENDING THAT I HAD HEARD OF SUCH A LADY LIVING AT A CERTAIN PLACE I NAMED AT RANDOM AND HAD A CURIOSITY TO KNOW IF IT WERE THE SAME IN THE COURSE OF THAT LETTER I TOLD PEGGOTTY THAT I HAD A PARTICULAR OCCASION FOR HALF A GUINEA AND THAT IF SHE COULD LEND ME THAT SUM UNTIL I COULD REPAY IT I SHOULD BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO HER AND WOULD TELL HER AFTERWARDS WHAT I HAD WANTED IT FOR PEGGOTTYS ANSWER SOON ARRIVED AND WAS AS USUAL FULL OF AFFECTIONATE DEVOTION SHE ENCLOSED THE HALF GUINEA I WAS AFRAID SHE MUST HAVE HAD A WORLD OF TROUBLE TO GET IT OUT OF MR BARKISS BOX AND TOLD ME THAT MISS BETSEY LIVED NEAR DOVER BUT WHETHER AT DOVER ITSELF AT HYTHE SANDGATE OR FOLKESTONE SHE COULD NOT SAY ONE OF OUR MEN HOWEVER INFORMING ME ON MY ASKING HIM ABOUT THESE PLACES THAT THEY WERE ALL CLOSE TOGETHER I DEEMED THIS ENOUGH FOR MY OBJECT AND RESOLVED TO SET OUT AT THE END OF THAT WEEK BEING A VERY HONEST LITTLE CREATURE AND UNWILLING TO DISGRACE THE MEMORY I WAS GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND ME AT MURDSTONE AND GRINBYS I CONSIDERED MYSELF BOUND TO REMAIN UNTIL SATURDAY NIGHT AND AS I HAD BEEN PAID A WEEKS WAGES IN ADVANCE WHEN I FIRST CAME THERE NOT TO PRESENT MYSELF IN THE COUNTINGHOUSE AT THE USUAL HOUR TO RECEIVE MY STIPEND FOR THIS EXPRESS REASON I HAD BORROWED THE HALFGUINEA THAT I MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT A FUND FOR MY TRAVELLINGEXPENSES ACCORDINGLY WHEN THE SATURDAY NIGHT CAME AND WE WERE ALL WAITING IN THE WAREHOUSE TO BE PAID AND TIPP THE CARMAN WHO ALWAYS TOOK PRECEDENCE WENT IN FIRST TO DRAW HIS MONEY I SHOOK MICK WALKER BY THE HAND ASKED HIM WHEN IT CAME TO HIS TURN TO BE PAID TO SAY TO MR QUINION THAT I HAD GONE TO MOVE MY BOX TO TIPPS AND BIDDING A LAST GOOD NIGHT TO MEALY POTATOES RAN AWAY MY BOX WAS AT MY OLD LODGING OVER THE WATER AND I HAD WRITTEN A DIRECTION FOR IT ON THE BACK OF ONE OF OUR ADDRESS CARDS THAT WE NAILED ON THE CASKS MASTER DAVID TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR AT THE COACH OFFICE DOVER THIS I HAD IN MY POCKET READY TO PUT ON THE BOX AFTER I SHOULD HAVE GOT IT OUT OF THE HOUSE AND AS I WENT TOWARDS MY LODGING I LOOKED ABOUT ME FOR SOMEONE WHO WOULD HELP ME TO CARRY IT TO THE BOOKINGOFFICE THERE WAS A LONGLEGGED YOUNG MAN WITH A VERY LITTLE EMPTY DONKEYCART STANDING NEAR THE OBELISK IN THE BLACKFRIARS ROAD WHOSE EYE I CAUGHT AS I WAS GOING BY AND WHO ADDRESSING ME AS SIXPENNORTH OF BAD HAPENCE HOPED I SHOULD KNOW HIM AGIN TO SWEAR TOIN ALLUSION I HAVE NO DOUBT TO MY STARING AT HIM I STOPPED TO ASSURE HIM THAT I HAD NOT DONE SO IN BAD MANNERS BUT UNCERTAIN WHETHER HE MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT LIKE A JOB WOT JOB SAID THE LONGLEGGED YOUNG MAN TO MOVE A BOX I ANSWERED WOT BOX SAID THE LONGLEGGED YOUNG MAN I TOLD HIM MINE WHICH WAS DOWN THAT STREET THERE AND WHICH I WANTED HIM TO TAKE TO THE DOVER COACH OFFICE FOR SIXPENCE DONE WITH YOU FOR A TANNER SAID THE LONGLEGGED YOUNG MAN AND DIRECTLY GOT UPON HIS CART WHICH WAS NOTHING BUT A LARGE WOODEN TRAY ON WHEELS AND RATTLED AWAY AT SUCH A RATE THAT IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO KEEP PACE WITH THE DONKEY THERE WAS A DEFIANT MANNER ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN AND PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH HE CHEWED STRAW AS HE SPOKE TO ME THAT I DID NOT MUCH LIKE AS THE BARGAIN WAS MADE HOWEVER I TOOK HIM UPSTAIRS TO THE ROOM I WAS LEAVING AND WE BROUGHT THE BOX DOWN AND PUT IT ON HIS CART NOW I WAS UNWILLING TO PUT THE DIRECTIONCARD ON THERE LEST ANY OF MY LANDLORDS FAMILY SHOULD FATHOM WHAT I WAS DOING AND DETAIN ME SO I SAID TO THE YOUNG MAN THAT I WOULD BE GLAD IF HE WOULD STOP FOR A MINUTE WHEN HE CAME TO THE DEADWALL OF THE KINGS BENCH PRISON THE WORDS WERE NO SOONER OUT OF MY MOUTH THAN HE RATTLED AWAY AS IF HE MY BOX THE CART AND THE DONKEY WERE ALL EQUALLY MAD AND I WAS QUITE OUT OF BREATH WITH RUNNING AND CALLING AFTER HIM WHEN I CAUGHT HIM AT THE PLACE APPOINTED BEING MUCH FLUSHED AND EXCITED I TUMBLED MY HALFGUINEA OUT OF MY POCKET IN PULLING THE CARD OUT I PUT IT IN MY MOUTH FOR SAFETY AND THOUGH MY HANDS TREMBLED A GOOD DEAL HAD JUST TIED THE CARD ON VERY MUCH TO MY SATISFACTION WHEN I FELT MYSELF VIOLENTLY CHUCKED UNDER THE CHIN BY THE LONGLEGGED YOUNG MAN AND SAW MY HALFGUINEA FLY OUT OF MY MOUTH INTO HIS HAND WOT SAID THE YOUNG MAN SEIZING ME BY MY JACKET COLLAR WITH A FRIGHTFUL GRIN THIS IS A POLLIS CASE IS IT YOURE AGOING TO BOLT ARE YOU COME TO THE POLLIS YOU YOUNG WARMIN COME TO THE POLLIS YOU GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK IF YOU PLEASE SAID I VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED AND LEAVE ME ALONE COME TO THE POLLIS SAID THE YOUNG MAN YOU SHALL PROVE IT YOURN TO THE POLLIS GIVE ME MY BOX AND MONEY WILL YOU I CRIED BURSTING INTO TEARS THE YOUNG MAN STILL REPLIED COME TO THE POLLIS AND WAS DRAGGING ME AGAINST THE DONKEY IN A VIOLENT MANNER AS IF THERE WERE ANY AFFINITY BETWEEN THAT ANIMAL AND A MAGISTRATE WHEN HE CHANGED HIS MIND JUMPED INTO THE CART SAT UPON MY BOX AND EXCLAIMING THAT HE WOULD DRIVE TO THE POLLIS STRAIGHT RATTLED AWAY HARDER THAN EVER I RAN AFTER HIM AS FAST AS I COULD BUT I HAD NO BREATH TO CALL OUT WITH AND SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO CALL OUT NOW IF I HAD I NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING RUN OVER TWENTY TIMES AT LEAST IN HALF A MILE NOW I LOST HIM NOW I SAW HIM NOW I LOST HIM NOW I WAS CUT AT WITH A WHIP NOW SHOUTED AT NOW DOWN IN THE MUD NOW UP AGAIN NOW RUNNING INTO SOMEBODYS ARMS NOW RUNNING HEADLONG AT A POST AT LENGTH CONFUSED BY FRIGHT AND HEAT AND DOUBTING WHETHER HALF LONDON MIGHT NOT BY THIS TIME BE TURNING OUT FOR MY APPREHENSION I LEFT THE YOUNG MAN TO GO WHERE HE WOULD WITH MY BOX AND MONEY AND PANTING AND CRYING BUT NEVER STOPPING FACED ABOUT FOR GREENWICH WHICH I HAD UNDERSTOOD WAS ON THE DOVER ROAD TAKING VERY LITTLE MORE OUT OF THE WORLD TOWARDS THE RETREAT OF MY AUNT MISS BETSEY THAN I HAD BROUGHT INTO IT ON THE NIGHT WHEN MY ARRIVAL GAVE HER SO MUCH UMBRAGE CHAPTER THE SEQUEL OF MY RESOLUTION FOR ANYTHING I KNOW I MAY HAVE HAD SOME WILD IDEA OF RUNNING ALL THE WAY TO DOVER WHEN I GAVE UP THE PURSUIT OF THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE DONKEYCART AND STARTED FOR GREENWICH MY SCATTERED SENSES WERE SOON COLLECTED AS TO THAT POINT IF I HAD FOR I CAME TO A STOP IN THE KENT ROAD AT A TERRACE WITH A PIECE OF WATER BEFORE IT AND A GREAT FOOLISH IMAGE IN THE MIDDLE BLOWING A DRY SHELL HERE I SAT DOWN ON A DOORSTEP QUITE SPENT AND EXHAUSTED WITH THE EFFORTS I HAD ALREADY MADE AND WITH HARDLY BREATH ENOUGH TO CRY FOR THE LOSS OF MY BOX AND HALFGUINEA IT WAS BY THIS TIME DARK I HEARD THE CLOCKS STRIKE TEN AS I SAT RESTING BUT IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT FORTUNATELY AND FINE WEATHER WHEN I HAD RECOVERED MY BREATH AND HAD GOT RID OF A STIFLING SENSATION IN MY THROAT I ROSE UP AND WENT ON IN THE MIDST OF MY DISTRESS I HAD NO NOTION OF GOING BACK I DOUBT IF I SHOULD HAVE HAD ANY THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN A SWISS SNOWDRIFT IN THE KENT ROAD BUT MY STANDING POSSESSED OF ONLY THREEHALFPENCE IN THE WORLD AND I AM SURE I WONDER HOW THEY CAME TO BE LEFT IN MY POCKET ON A SATURDAY NIGHT TROUBLED ME NONE THE LESS BECAUSE I WENT ON I BEGAN TO PICTURE TO MYSELF AS A SCRAP OF NEWSPAPER INTELLIGENCE MY BEING FOUND DEAD IN A DAY OR TWO UNDER SOME HEDGE AND I TRUDGED ON MISERABLY THOUGH AS FAST AS I COULD UNTIL I HAPPENED TO PASS A LITTLE SHOP WHERE IT WAS WRITTEN UP THAT LADIES AND GENTLEMENS WARDROBES WERE BOUGHT AND THAT THE BEST PRICE WAS GIVEN FOR RAGS BONES AND KITCHENSTUFF THE MASTER OF THIS SHOP WAS SITTING AT THE DOOR IN HIS SHIRTSLEEVES SMOKING AND AS THERE WERE A GREAT MANY COATS AND PAIRS OF TROUSERS DANGLING FROM THE LOW CEILING AND ONLY TWO FEEBLE CANDLES BURNING INSIDE TO SHOW WHAT THEY WERE I FANCIED THAT HE LOOKED LIKE A MAN OF A REVENGEFUL DISPOSITION WHO HAD HUNG ALL HIS ENEMIES AND WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF MY LATE EXPERIENCES WITH MR AND MRS MICAWBER SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HERE MIGHT BE A MEANS OF KEEPING OFF THE WOLF FOR A LITTLE WHILE I WENT UP THE NEXT BYSTREET TOOK OFF MY WAISTCOAT ROLLED IT NEATLY UNDER MY ARM AND CAME BACK TO THE SHOP DOOR IF YOU PLEASE SIR I SAID I AM TO SELL THIS FOR A FAIR PRICE MR DOLLOBYDOLLOBY WAS THE NAME OVER THE SHOP DOOR AT LEASTTOOK THE WAISTCOAT STOOD HIS PIPE ON ITS HEAD AGAINST THE DOORPOST WENT INTO THE SHOP FOLLOWED BY ME SNUFFED THE TWO CANDLES WITH HIS FINGERS SPREAD THE WAISTCOAT ON THE COUNTER AND LOOKED AT IT THERE HELD IT UP AGAINST THE LIGHT AND LOOKED AT IT THERE AND ULTIMATELY SAID WHAT DO YOU CALL A PRICE NOW FOR THIS HERE LITTLE WESKIT OH YOU KNOW BEST SIR I RETURNED MODESTLY I CANT BE BUYER AND SELLER TOO SAID MR DOLLOBY PUT A PRICE ON THIS HERE LITTLE WESKIT WOULD EIGHTEENPENCE BEI HINTED AFTER SOME HESITATION MR DOLLOBY ROLLED IT UP AGAIN AND GAVE IT ME BACK I SHOULD ROB MY FAMILY HE SAID IF I WAS TO OFFER NINEPENCE FOR IT THIS WAS A DISAGREEABLE WAY OF PUTTING THE BUSINESS BECAUSE IT IMPOSED UPON ME A PERFECT STRANGER THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF ASKING MR DOLLOBY TO ROB HIS FAMILY ON MY ACCOUNT MY CIRCUMSTANCES BEING SO VERY PRESSING HOWEVER I SAID I WOULD TAKE NINEPENCE FOR IT IF HE PLEASED MR DOLLOBY NOT WITHOUT SOME GRUMBLING GAVE NINEPENCE I WISHED HIM GOOD NIGHT AND WALKED OUT OF THE SHOP THE RICHER BY THAT SUM AND THE POORER BY A WAISTCOAT BUT WHEN I BUTTONED MY JACKET THAT WAS NOT MUCH INDEED I FORESAW PRETTY CLEARLY THAT MY JACKET WOULD GO NEXT AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST OF MY WAY TO DOVER IN A SHIRT AND A PAIR OF TROUSERS AND MIGHT DEEM MYSELF LUCKY IF I GOT THERE EVEN IN THAT TRIM BUT MY MIND DID NOT RUN SO MUCH ON THIS AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED BEYOND A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF THE DISTANCE BEFORE ME AND OF THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE DONKEYCART HAVING USED ME CRUELLY I THINK I HAD NO VERY URGENT SENSE OF MY DIFFICULTIES WHEN I ONCE AGAIN SET OFF WITH MY NINEPENCE IN MY POCKET A PLAN HAD OCCURRED TO ME FOR PASSING THE NIGHT WHICH I WAS GOING TO CARRY INTO EXECUTION THIS WAS TO LIE BEHIND THE WALL AT THE BACK OF MY OLD SCHOOL IN A CORNER WHERE THERE USED TO BE A HAYSTACK I IMAGINED IT WOULD BE A KIND OF COMPANY TO HAVE THE BOYS AND THE BEDROOM WHERE I USED TO TELL THE STORIES SO NEAR ME ALTHOUGH THE BOYS WOULD KNOW NOTHING OF MY BEING THERE AND THE BEDROOM WOULD YIELD ME NO SHELTER I HAD HAD A HARD DAYS WORK AND WAS PRETTY WELL JADED WHEN I CAME CLIMBING OUT AT LAST UPON THE LEVEL OF BLACKHEATH IT COST ME SOME TROUBLE TO FIND OUT SALEM HOUSE BUT I FOUND IT AND I FOUND A HAYSTACK IN THE CORNER AND I LAY DOWN BY IT HAVING FIRST WALKED ROUND THE WALL AND LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS AND SEEN THAT ALL WAS DARK AND SILENT WITHIN NEVER SHALL I FORGET THE LONELY SENSATION OF FIRST LYING DOWN WITHOUT A ROOF ABOVE MY HEAD SLEEP CAME UPON ME AS IT CAME ON MANY OTHER OUTCASTS AGAINST WHOM HOUSEDOORS WERE LOCKED AND HOUSEDOGS BARKED THAT NIGHTAND I DREAMED OF LYING ON MY OLD SCHOOLBED TALKING TO THE BOYS IN MY ROOM AND FOUND MYSELF SITTING UPRIGHT WITH STEERFORTHS NAME UPON MY LIPS LOOKING WILDLY AT THE STARS THAT WERE GLISTENING AND GLIMMERING ABOVE ME WHEN I REMEMBERED WHERE I WAS AT THAT UNTIMELY HOUR A FEELING STOLE UPON ME THAT MADE ME GET UP AFRAID OF I DONT KNOW WHAT AND WALK ABOUT BUT THE FAINTER GLIMMERING OF THE STARS AND THE PALE LIGHT IN THE SKY WHERE THE DAY WAS COMING REASSURED ME AND MY EYES BEING VERY HEAVY I LAY DOWN AGAIN AND SLEPTTHOUGH WITH A KNOWLEDGE IN MY SLEEP THAT IT WAS COLDUNTIL THE WARM BEAMS OF THE SUN AND THE RINGING OF THE GETTINGUP BELL AT SALEM HOUSE AWOKE ME IF I COULD HAVE HOPED THAT STEERFORTH WAS THERE I WOULD HAVE LURKED ABOUT UNTIL HE CAME OUT ALONE BUT I KNEW HE MUST HAVE LEFT LONG SINCE TRADDLES STILL REMAINED PERHAPS BUT IT WAS VERY DOUBTFUL AND I HAD NOT SUFFICIENT CONFIDENCE IN HIS DISCRETION OR GOOD LUCK HOWEVER STRONG MY RELIANCE WAS ON HIS GOOD NATURE TO WISH TO TRUST HIM WITH MY SITUATION SO I CREPT AWAY FROM THE WALL AS MR CREAKLES BOYS WERE GETTING UP AND STRUCK INTO THE LONG DUSTY TRACK WHICH I HAD FIRST KNOWN TO BE THE DOVER ROAD WHEN I WAS ONE OF THEM AND WHEN I LITTLE EXPECTED THAT ANY EYES WOULD EVER SEE ME THE WAYFARER I WAS NOW UPON IT WHAT A DIFFERENT SUNDAY MORNING FROM THE OLD SUNDAY MORNING AT YARMOUTH IN DUE TIME I HEARD THE CHURCHBELLS RINGING AS I PLODDED ON AND I MET PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO CHURCH AND I PASSED A CHURCH OR TWO WHERE THE CONGREGATION WERE INSIDE AND THE SOUND OF SINGING CAME OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE WHILE THE BEADLE SAT AND COOLED HIMSELF IN THE SHADE OF THE PORCH OR STOOD BENEATH THE YEWTREE WITH HIS HAND TO HIS FOREHEAD GLOWERING AT ME GOING BY BUT THE PEACE AND REST OF THE OLD SUNDAY MORNING WERE ON EVERYTHING EXCEPT ME THAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE I FELT QUITE WICKED IN MY DIRT AND DUST WITH MY TANGLED HAIR BUT FOR THE QUIET PICTURE I HAD CONJURED UP OF MY MOTHER IN HER YOUTH AND BEAUTY WEEPING BY THE FIRE AND MY AUNT RELENTING TO HER I HARDLY THINK I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO GO ON UNTIL NEXT DAY BUT IT ALWAYS WENT BEFORE ME AND I FOLLOWED I GOT THAT SUNDAY THROUGH THREEANDTWENTY MILES ON THE STRAIGHT ROAD THOUGH NOT VERY EASILY FOR I WAS NEW TO THAT KIND OF TOIL I SEE MYSELF AS EVENING CLOSES IN COMING OVER THE BRIDGE AT ROCHESTER FOOTSORE AND TIRED AND EATING BREAD THAT I HAD BOUGHT FOR SUPPER ONE OR TWO LITTLE HOUSES WITH THE NOTICE LODGINGS FOR TRAVELLERS HANGING OUT HAD TEMPTED ME BUT I WAS AFRAID OF SPENDING THE FEW PENCE I HAD AND WAS EVEN MORE AFRAID OF THE VICIOUS LOOKS OF THE TRAMPERS I HAD MET OR OVERTAKEN I SOUGHT NO SHELTER THEREFORE BUT THE SKY AND TOILING INTO CHATHAMWHICH IN THAT NIGHTS ASPECT IS A MERE DREAM OF CHALK AND DRAWBRIDGES AND MASTLESS SHIPS IN A MUDDY RIVER ROOFED LIKE NOAHS ARKSCREPT AT LAST UPON A SORT OF GRASSGROWN BATTERY OVERHANGING A LANE WHERE A SENTRY WAS WALKING TO AND FRO HERE I LAY DOWN NEAR A CANNON AND HAPPY IN THE SOCIETY OF THE SENTRYS FOOTSTEPS THOUGH HE KNEW NO MORE OF MY BEING ABOVE HIM THAN THE BOYS AT SALEM HOUSE HAD KNOWN OF MY LYING BY THE WALL SLEPT SOUNDLY UNTIL MORNING VERY STIFF AND SORE OF FOOT I WAS IN THE MORNING AND QUITE DAZED BY THE BEATING OF DRUMS AND MARCHING OF TROOPS WHICH SEEMED TO HEM ME IN ON EVERY SIDE WHEN I WENT DOWN TOWARDS THE LONG NARROW STREET FEELING THAT I COULD GO BUT A VERY LITTLE WAY THAT DAY IF I WERE TO RESERVE ANY STRENGTH FOR GETTING TO MY JOURNEYS END I RESOLVED TO MAKE THE SALE OF MY JACKET ITS PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACCORDINGLY I TOOK THE JACKET OFF THAT I MIGHT LEARN TO DO WITHOUT IT AND CARRYING IT UNDER MY ARM BEGAN A TOUR OF INSPECTION OF THE VARIOUS SLOPSHOPS IT WAS A LIKELY PLACE TO SELL A JACKET IN FOR THE DEALERS IN SECONDHAND CLOTHES WERE NUMEROUS AND WERE GENERALLY SPEAKING ON THE LOOKOUT FOR CUSTOMERS AT THEIR SHOP DOORS BUT AS MOST OF THEM HAD HANGING UP AMONG THEIR STOCK AN OFFICERS COAT OR TWO EPAULETTES AND ALL I WAS RENDERED TIMID BY THE COSTLY NATURE OF THEIR DEALINGS AND WALKED ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT OFFERING MY MERCHANDISE TO ANYONE THIS MODESTY OF MINE DIRECTED MY ATTENTION TO THE MARINESTORE SHOPS AND SUCH SHOPS AS MR DOLLOBYS IN PREFERENCE TO THE REGULAR DEALERS AT LAST I FOUND ONE THAT I THOUGHT LOOKED PROMISING AT THE CORNER OF A DIRTY LANE ENDING IN AN ENCLOSURE FULL OF STINGINGNETTLES AGAINST THE PALINGS OF WHICH SOME SECONDHAND SAILORS CLOTHES THAT SEEMED TO HAVE OVERFLOWED THE SHOP WERE FLUTTERING AMONG SOME COTS AND RUSTY GUNS AND OILSKIN HATS AND CERTAIN TRAYS FULL OF SO MANY OLD RUSTY KEYS OF SO MANY SIZES THAT THEY SEEMED VARIOUS ENOUGH TO OPEN ALL THE DOORS IN THE WORLD INTO THIS SHOP WHICH WAS LOW AND SMALL AND WHICH WAS DARKENED RATHER THAN LIGHTED BY A LITTLE WINDOW OVERHUNG WITH CLOTHES AND WAS DESCENDED INTO BY SOME STEPS I WENT WITH A PALPITATING HEART WHICH WAS NOT RELIEVED WHEN AN UGLY OLD MAN WITH THE LOWER PART OF HIS FACE ALL COVERED WITH A STUBBLY GREY BEARD RUSHED OUT OF A DIRTY DEN BEHIND IT AND SEIZED ME BY THE HAIR OF MY HEAD HE WAS A DREADFUL OLD MAN TO LOOK AT IN A FILTHY FLANNEL WAISTCOAT AND SMELLING TERRIBLY OF RUM HIS BEDSTEAD COVERED WITH A TUMBLED AND RAGGED PIECE OF PATCHWORK WAS IN THE DEN HE HAD COME FROM WHERE ANOTHER LITTLE WINDOW SHOWED A PROSPECT OF MORE STINGINGNETTLES AND A LAME DONKEY OH WHAT DO YOU WANT GRINNED THIS OLD MAN IN A FIERCE MONOTONOUS WHINE OH MY EYES AND LIMBS WHAT DO YOU WANT OH MY LUNGS AND LIVER WHAT DO YOU WANT OH GOROO GOROO I WAS SO MUCH DISMAYED BY THESE WORDS AND PARTICULARLY BY THE REPETITION OF THE LAST UNKNOWN ONE WHICH WAS A KIND OF RATTLE IN HIS THROAT THAT I

FOR THE MONEY THERE NEVER WAS SUCH ANOTHER DRUNKEN MADMAN IN THAT LINE OF BUSINESS I HOPE THAT HE WAS WELL KNOWN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND ENJOYED THE REPUTATION OF HAVING SOLD HIMSELF TO THE DEVIL I

WHERE I RESTED COMFORTABLY AFTER HAVING WASHED MY BLISTERED FEET IN A STREAM AND DRESSED THEM AS WELL AS I WAS ABLE WITH SOME COOL LEAVES WHEN I TOOK THE ROAD AGAIN NEXT MORNING I FOUND THAT IT LAY THROUGH A SUCCESSION OF HOPGROUNDS AND ORCHARDS IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY LATE IN THE YEAR FOR THE ORCHARDS TO BE RUDDY WITH RIPE APPLES AND IN A FEW PLACES THE HOPPICKERS WERE ALREADY AT WORK I THOUGHT IT ALL EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL AND MADE UP MY MIND TO SLEEP AMONG THE HOPS THAT NIGHT IMAGINING SOME CHEERFUL COMPANIONSHIP IN THE LONG PERSPECTIVES OF POLES WITH THE GRACEFUL LEAVES TWINING ROUND THEM THE TRAMPERS WERE WORSE THAN EVER THAT DAY AND INSPIRED ME WITH A DREAD THAT IS YET QUITE FRESH IN MY MIND SOME OF THEM WERE MOST FEROCIOUSLOOKING RUFFIANS WHO STARED AT ME AS I WENT BY AND STOPPED PERHAPS AND CALLED AFTER ME TO COME BACK AND SPEAK TO THEM AND WHEN I TOOK TO MY HEELS STONED ME I RECOLLECT ONE YOUNG FELLOWA TINKER I SUPPOSE FROM HIS WALLET AND BRAZIERWHO HAD A WOMAN WITH HIM AND WHO FACED ABOUT AND STARED AT ME THUS AND THEN ROARED TO ME IN SUCH A TREMENDOUS VOICE TO COME BACK THAT I HALTED AND LOOKED ROUND COME HERE WHEN YOURE CALLED SAID THE TINKER OR ILL RIP YOUR YOUNG BODY OPEN I THOUGHT IT BEST TO GO BACK AS I DREW NEARER TO THEM TRYING TO PROPITIATE THE TINKER BY MY LOOKS I OBSERVED THAT THE WOMAN HAD A BLACK EYE WHERE ARE YOU GOING SAID THE TINKER GRIPPING THE BOSOM OF MY SHIRT WITH HIS BLACKENED HAND I AM GOING TO DOVER I SAID WHERE DO YOU COME FROM ASKED THE TINKER GIVING HIS HAND ANOTHER TURN IN MY SHIRT TO HOLD ME MORE SECURELY I COME FROM LONDON I SAID WHAT LAY ARE YOU UPON ASKED THE TINKER ARE YOU A PRIG NNO I SAID AINT YOU BY G IF YOU MAKE A BRAG OF YOUR HONESTY TO ME SAID THE TINKER ILL KNOCK YOUR BRAINS OUT WITH HIS DISENGAGED HAND HE MADE A MENACE OF STRIKING ME AND THEN LOOKED AT ME FROM HEAD TO FOOT HAVE YOU GOT THE PRICE OF A PINT OF BEER ABOUT YOU SAID THE TINKER IF YOU HAVE OUT WITH IT AFORE I TAKE IT AWAY I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE PRODUCED IT BUT THAT I MET THE WOMANS LOOK AND SAW HER VERY SLIGHTLY SHAKE HER HEAD AND FORM NO WITH HER LIPS I AM VERY POOR I SAID ATTEMPTING TO SMILE AND HAVE GOT NO MONEY WHY WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID THE TINKER LOOKING SO STERNLY AT ME THAT I ALMOST FEARED HE SAW THE MONEY IN MY POCKET SIR I STAMMERED WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID THE TINKER BY WEARING MY BROTHERS SILK HANDKERCHIEF GIVE IT OVER HERE AND HE HAD MINE OFF MY NECK IN A MOMENT AND TOSSED IT TO THE WOMAN THE WOMAN BURST INTO A FIT OF LAUGHTER AS IF SHE THOUGHT THIS A JOKE AND TOSSED IT BACK TO ME NODDED ONCE AS SLIGHTLY AS BEFORE AND MADE THE WORD GO WITH HER LIPS BEFORE I COULD OBEY HOWEVER THE TINKER SEIZED THE HANDKERCHIEF OUT OF MY HAND WITH A ROUGHNESS THAT THREW ME AWAY LIKE A FEATHER AND PUTTING IT LOOSELY ROUND HIS OWN NECK TURNED UPON THE WOMAN WITH AN OATH AND KNOCKED HER DOWN I NEVER SHALL FORGET SEEING HER FALL BACKWARD ON THE HARD ROAD AND LIE THERE WITH HER BONNET TUMBLED OFF AND HER HAIR ALL WHITENED IN THE DUST NOR WHEN I LOOKED BACK FROM A DISTANCE SEEING HER SITTING ON THE PATHWAY WHICH WAS A BANK BY THE ROADSIDE WIPING THE BLOOD FROM HER FACE WITH A CORNER OF HER SHAWL WHILE HE WENT ON AHEAD THIS ADVENTURE FRIGHTENED ME SO THAT AFTERWARDS WHEN I SAW ANY OF THESE PEOPLE COMING I TURNED BACK UNTIL I COULD FIND A HIDINGPLACE WHERE I REMAINED UNTIL THEY HAD GONE OUT OF SIGHT WHICH HAPPENED SO OFTEN THAT I WAS VERY SERIOUSLY DELAYED BUT UNDER THIS DIFFICULTY AS UNDER ALL THE OTHER DIFFICULTIES OF MY JOURNEY I SEEMED TO BE SUSTAINED AND LED ON BY MY FANCIFUL PICTURE OF MY MOTHER IN HER YOUTH BEFORE I CAME INTO THE WORLD IT ALWAYS KEPT ME COMPANY IT WAS THERE AMONG THE HOPS WHEN I LAY DOWN TO SLEEP IT WAS WITH ME ON MY WAKING IN THE MORNING IT WENT BEFORE ME ALL DAY I HAVE ASSOCIATED IT EVER SINCE WITH THE SUNNY STREET OF CANTERBURY DOZING AS IT WERE IN THE HOT LIGHT AND WITH THE SIGHT OF ITS OLD HOUSES AND GATEWAYS AND THE STATELY GREY CATHEDRAL WITH THE ROOKS SAILING ROUND THE TOWERS WHEN I CAME AT LAST UPON THE BARE WIDE DOWNS NEAR DOVER IT RELIEVED THE SOLITARY ASPECT OF THE SCENE WITH HOPE AND NOT UNTIL I REACHED THAT FIRST GREAT AIM OF MY JOURNEY AND ACTUALLY SET FOOT IN THE TOWN ITSELF ON THE SIXTH DAY OF MY FLIGHT DID IT DESERT ME BUT THEN STRANGE TO SAY WHEN I STOOD WITH MY RAGGED SHOES AND MY DUSTY SUNBURNT HALFCLOTHED FIGURE IN THE PLACE SO LONG DESIRED IT SEEMED TO VANISH LIKE A DREAM AND TO LEAVE ME HELPLESS AND DISPIRITED I INQUIRED ABOUT MY AUNT AMONG THE BOATMEN FIRST AND RECEIVED VARIOUS ANSWERS ONE SAID SHE LIVED IN THE SOUTH FORELAND LIGHT AND HAD SINGED HER WHISKERS BY DOING SO ANOTHER THAT SHE WAS MADE FAST TO THE GREAT BUOY OUTSIDE THE HARBOUR AND COULD ONLY BE VISITED AT HALFTIDE A THIRD THAT SHE WAS LOCKED UP IN MAIDSTONE JAIL FOR CHILDSTEALING A FOURTH THAT SHE WAS SEEN TO MOUNT A BROOM IN THE LAST HIGH WIND AND MAKE DIRECT FOR CALAIS THE FLYDRIVERS AMONG WHOM I INQUIRED NEXT WERE EQUALLY JOCOSE AND EQUALLY DISRESPECTFUL AND THE SHOPKEEPERS NOT LIKING MY APPEARANCE GENERALLY REPLIED WITHOUT HEARING WHAT I HAD TO SAY THAT THEY HAD GOT NOTHING FOR ME I FELT MORE MISERABLE AND DESTITUTE THAN I HAD DONE AT ANY PERIOD OF MY RUNNING AWAY MY MONEY WAS ALL GONE I HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DISPOSE OF I WAS HUNGRY THIRSTY AND WORN OUT AND SEEMED AS DISTANT FROM MY END AS IF I HAD REMAINED IN LONDON THE MORNING HAD WORN AWAY IN THESE INQUIRIES AND I WAS SITTING ON THE STEP OF AN EMPTY SHOP AT A STREET CORNER NEAR THE MARKETPLACE DELIBERATING UPON WANDERING TOWARDS THOSE OTHER PLACES WHICH HAD BEEN MENTIONED WHEN A FLYDRIVER COMING BY WITH HIS CARRIAGE DROPPED A HORSECLOTH SOMETHING GOODNATURED IN THE MANS FACE AS I HANDED IT UP ENCOURAGED ME TO ASK HIM IF HE COULD TELL ME WHERE MISS TROTWOOD LIVED THOUGH I HAD ASKED THE QUESTION SO OFTEN THAT IT ALMOST DIED UPON MY LIPS TROTWOOD SAID HE LET ME SEE I KNOW THE NAME TOO OLD LADY YES I SAID RATHER PRETTY STIFF IN THE BACK SAID HE MAKING HIMSELF UPRIGHT YES I SAID I SHOULD THINK IT VERY LIKELY CARRIES A BAG SAID HEBAG WITH A GOOD DEAL OF ROOM IN ITIS GRUFFISH AND COMES DOWN UPON YOU SHARP MY HEART SANK WITHIN ME AS I ACKNOWLEDGED THE UNDOUBTED ACCURACY OF THIS DESCRIPTION WHY THEN I TELL YOU WHAT SAID HE IF YOU GO UP THERE POINTING WITH HIS WHIP TOWARDS THE HEIGHTS AND KEEP RIGHT ON TILL YOU COME TO SOME HOUSES FACING THE SEA I THINK YOULL HEAR OF HER MY OPINION IS SHE WONT STAND ANYTHING SO HERES A PENNY FOR YOU I ACCEPTED THE GIFT THANKFULLY AND BOUGHT A LOAF WITH IT DISPATCHING THIS REFRESHMENT BY THE WAY I WENT IN THE DIRECTION MY FRIEND HAD INDICATED AND WALKED ON A GOOD DISTANCE WITHOUT COMING TO THE HOUSES HE HAD MENTIONED AT LENGTH I SAW SOME BEFORE ME AND APPROACHING THEM WENT INTO A LITTLE SHOP IT WAS WHAT WE USED TO CALL A GENERAL SHOP AT HOME AND INQUIRED IF THEY COULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TELL ME WHERE MISS TROTWOOD LIVED I ADDRESSED MYSELF TO A MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER WHO WAS WEIGHING SOME RICE FOR A YOUNG WOMAN BUT THE LATTER TAKING THE INQUIRY TO HERSELF TURNED ROUND QUICKLY MY MISTRESS SHE SAID WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HER BOY I WANT I REPLIED TO SPEAK TO HER IF YOU PLEASE TO BEG OF HER YOU MEAN RETORTED THE DAMSEL NO I SAID INDEED BUT SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THAT IN TRUTH I CAME FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE I HELD MY PEACE IN CONFUSION AND FELT MY FACE BURN MY AUNTS HANDMAID AS I SUPPOSED SHE WAS FROM WHAT SHE HAD SAID PUT HER RICE IN A LITTLE BASKET AND WALKED OUT OF THE SHOP TELLING ME THAT I COULD FOLLOW HER IF I WANTED TO KNOW WHERE MISS TROTWOOD LIVED I NEEDED NO SECOND PERMISSION THOUGH I WAS BY THIS TIME IN SUCH A STATE OF CONSTERNATION AND AGITATION THAT MY LEGS SHOOK UNDER ME I FOLLOWED THE YOUNG WOMAN AND WE SOON CAME TO A VERY NEAT LITTLE COTTAGE WITH CHEERFUL BOWWINDOWS IN FRONT OF IT A SMALL SQUARE GRAVELLED COURT OR GARDEN FULL OF FLOWERS CAREFULLY TENDED AND SMELLING DELICIOUSLY THIS IS MISS TROTWOODS SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN NOW YOU KNOW AND THATS ALL I HAVE GOT TO SAY WITH WHICH WORDS SHE HURRIED INTO THE HOUSE AS IF TO SHAKE OFF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MY APPEARANCE AND LEFT ME STANDING AT THE GARDENGATE LOOKING DISCONSOLATELY OVER THE TOP OF IT TOWARDS THE PARLOUR WINDOW WHERE A MUSLIN CURTAIN PARTLY UNDRAWN IN THE MIDDLE A LARGE ROUND GREEN SCREEN OR FAN FASTENED ON TO THE WINDOWSILL A SMALL TABLE AND A GREAT CHAIR SUGGESTED TO ME THAT MY AUNT MIGHT BE AT THAT MOMENT SEATED IN AWFUL STATE MY SHOES WERE BY THIS TIME IN A WOEFUL CONDITION THE SOLES HAD SHED THEMSELVES BIT BY BIT AND THE UPPER LEATHERS HAD BROKEN AND BURST UNTIL THE VERY SHAPE AND FORM OF SHOES HAD DEPARTED FROM THEM MY HAT WHICH HAD SERVED ME FOR A NIGHTCAP TOO WAS SO CRUSHED AND BENT THAT NO OLD BATTERED HANDLELESS SAUCEPAN ON A DUNGHILL NEED HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO VIE WITH IT MY SHIRT AND TROUSERS STAINED WITH HEAT DEW GRASS AND THE KENTISH SOIL ON WHICH I HAD SLEPTAND TORN BESIDESMIGHT HAVE FRIGHTENED THE BIRDS FROM MY AUNTS GARDEN AS I STOOD AT THE GATE MY HAIR HAD KNOWN NO COMB OR BRUSH SINCE I LEFT LONDON MY FACE NECK AND HANDS FROM UNACCUSTOMED EXPOSURE TO THE AIR AND SUN WERE BURNT TO A BERRYBROWN FROM HEAD TO FOOT I WAS POWDERED ALMOST AS WHITE WITH CHALK AND DUST AS IF I HAD COME OUT OF A LIMEKILN IN THIS PLIGHT AND WITH A STRONG CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT I WAITED TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO AND MAKE MY FIRST IMPRESSION ON MY FORMIDABLE AUNT THE UNBROKEN STILLNESS OF THE PARLOUR WINDOW LEADING ME TO INFER AFTER A WHILE THAT SHE WAS NOT THERE I LIFTED UP MY EYES TO THE WINDOW ABOVE IT WHERE I SAW A FLORID PLEASANTLOOKING GENTLEMAN WITH A GREY HEAD WHO SHUT UP ONE EYE IN A GROTESQUE MANNER NODDED HIS HEAD AT ME SEVERAL TIMES SHOOK IT AT ME AS OFTEN LAUGHED AND WENT AWAY I HAD BEEN DISCOMPOSED ENOUGH BEFORE BUT I WAS SO MUCH THE MORE DISCOMPOSED BY THIS UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR THAT I WAS ON THE POINT OF SLINKING OFF TO THINK HOW I HAD BEST PROCEED WHEN THERE CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE A LADY WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF TIED OVER HER CAP AND A PAIR OF GARDENING GLOVES ON HER HANDS WEARING A GARDENING POCKET LIKE A TOLLMANS APRON AND CARRYING A GREAT KNIFE I KNEW HER IMMEDIATELY TO BE MISS BETSEY FOR SHE CAME STALKING OUT OF THE HOUSE EXACTLY AS MY POOR MOTHER HAD SO OFTEN DESCRIBED HER STALKING UP OUR GARDEN AT BLUNDERSTONE ROOKERY GO AWAY SAID MISS BETSEY SHAKING HER HEAD AND MAKING A DISTANT CHOP IN THE AIR WITH HER KNIFE GO ALONG NO BOYS HERE I WATCHED HER WITH MY HEART AT MY LIPS AS SHE MARCHED TO A CORNER OF HER GARDEN AND STOOPED TO DIG UP SOME LITTLE ROOT THERE THEN WITHOUT A SCRAP OF COURAGE BUT WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DESPERATION I WENT SOFTLY IN AND STOOD BESIDE HER TOUCHING HER WITH MY FINGER IF YOU PLEASE MAAM I BEGAN SHE STARTED AND LOOKED UP IF YOU PLEASE AUNT EH EXCLAIMED MISS BETSEY IN A TONE OF AMAZEMENT I HAVE NEVER HEARD APPROACHED IF YOU PLEASE AUNT I AM YOUR NEPHEW OH LORD SAID MY AUNT AND SAT FLAT DOWN IN THE GARDENPATH I AM DAVID COPPERFIELD OF BLUNDERSTONE IN SUFFOLKWHERE YOU CAME ON THE NIGHT WHEN I WAS BORN AND SAW MY DEAR MAMA I HAVE BEEN VERY UNHAPPY SINCE SHE DIED I HAVE BEEN SLIGHTED AND TAUGHT NOTHING AND THROWN UPON MYSELF AND PUT TO WORK NOT FIT FOR ME IT MADE ME RUN AWAY TO YOU I WAS ROBBED AT FIRST SETTING OUT AND HAVE WALKED ALL THE WAY AND HAVE NEVER SLEPT IN A BED SINCE I BEGAN THE JOURNEY HERE MY SELFSUPPORT GAVE WAY ALL AT ONCE AND WITH A MOVEMENT OF MY HANDS INTENDED TO SHOW HER MY RAGGED STATE AND CALL IT TO WITNESS THAT I HAD SUFFERED SOMETHING I BROKE INTO A PASSION OF CRYING WHICH I SUPPOSE HAD BEEN PENT UP WITHIN ME ALL THE WEEK MY AUNT WITH EVERY SORT OF EXPRESSION BUT WONDER DISCHARGED FROM HER COUNTENANCE SAT ON THE GRAVEL STARING AT ME UNTIL I BEGAN TO CRY WHEN SHE GOT UP IN A GREAT HURRY COLLARED ME AND TOOK ME INTO THE PARLOUR HER FIRST PROCEEDING THERE WAS TO UNLOCK A TALL PRESS BRING OUT SEVERAL BOTTLES AND POUR SOME OF THE CONTENTS OF EACH INTO MY MOUTH I THINK THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT AT RANDOM FOR I AM SURE I TASTED ANISEED WATER ANCHOVY SAUCE AND SALAD DRESSING WHEN SHE HAD ADMINISTERED THESE RESTORATIVES AS I WAS STILL QUITE HYSTERICAL AND UNABLE TO CONTROL MY SOBS SHE PUT ME ON THE SOFA WITH A SHAWL UNDER MY HEAD AND THE HANDKERCHIEF FROM HER OWN HEAD UNDER MY FEET LEST I SHOULD SULLY THE COVER AND THEN SITTING HERSELF DOWN BEHIND THE GREEN FAN OR SCREEN I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED SO THAT I COULD NOT SEE HER FACE EJACULATED AT INTERVALS MERCY ON US LETTING THOSE EXCLAMATIONS OFF LIKE MINUTE GUNS AFTER A TIME SHE RANG THE BELL JANET SAID MY AUNT WHEN HER SERVANT CAME IN GO UPSTAIRS GIVE MY COMPLIMENTS TO MR DICK AND SAY I WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM JANET LOOKED A LITTLE SURPRISED TO SEE ME LYING STIFFLY ON THE SOFA I WAS AFRAID TO MOVE LEST IT SHOULD BE DISPLEASING TO MY AUNT BUT WENT ON HER ERRAND MY AUNT WITH HER HANDS BEHIND HER WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM UNTIL THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD SQUINTED AT ME FROM THE UPPER WINDOW CAME IN LAUGHING MR DICK SAID MY AUNT DONT BE A FOOL BECAUSE NOBODY CAN BE MORE DISCREET THAN YOU CAN WHEN YOU CHOOSE WE ALL KNOW THAT SO DONT BE A FOOL WHATEVER YOU ARE THE GENTLEMAN WAS SERIOUS IMMEDIATELY AND LOOKED AT ME I THOUGHT AS IF HE WOULD ENTREAT ME TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE WINDOW MR DICK SAID MY AUNT YOU HAVE HEARD ME MENTION DAVID COPPERFIELD NOW DONT PRETEND NOT TO HAVE A MEMORY BECAUSE YOU AND I KNOW BETTER DAVID COPPERFIELD SAID MR DICK WHO DID NOT APPEAR TO ME TO REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT IT DAVID COPPERFIELD OH YES TO BE SURE DAVID CERTAINLY WELL SAID MY AUNT THIS IS HIS BOYHIS SON HE WOULD BE AS LIKE HIS FATHER AS ITS POSSIBLE TO BE IF HE WAS NOT SO LIKE HIS MOTHER TOO HIS SON SAID MR DICK DAVIDS SON INDEED YES PURSUED MY AUNT AND HE HAS DONE A PRETTY PIECE OF BUSINESS HE HAS RUN AWAY AH HIS SISTER BETSEY TROTWOOD NEVER WOULD HAVE RUN AWAY MY AUNT SHOOK HER HEAD FIRMLY CONFIDENT IN THE CHARACTER AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE GIRL WHO NEVER WAS BORN OH YOU THINK SHE WOULDNT HAVE RUN AWAY SAID MR DICK BLESS AND SAVE THE MAN EXCLAIMED MY AUNT SHARPLY HOW HE TALKS DONT I KNOW SHE WOULDNT SHE WOULD HAVE LIVED WITH HER GODMOTHER AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO ONE ANOTHER WHERE IN THE NAME OF WONDER SHOULD HIS SISTER BETSEY TROTWOOD HAVE RUN FROM OR TO NOWHERE SAID MR DICK WELL THEN RETURNED MY AUNT SOFTENED BY THE REPLY HOW CAN YOU PRETEND TO BE WOOLGATHERING DICK WHEN YOU ARE AS SHARP AS A SURGEONS LANCET NOW HERE YOU SEE YOUNG DAVID COPPERFIELD AND THE QUESTION I PUT TO YOU IS

ADVICE WHY IF I WAS YOU SAID MR DICK CONSIDERING AND LOOKING VACANTLY AT ME I SHOULD THE CONTEMPLATION OF ME SEEMED TO INSPIRE HIM WITH A SUDDEN IDEA AND HE ADDED BRISKLY I SHOULD WASH HIM JANET SAID MY AUNT TURNING ROUND WITH A QUIET TRIUMPH WHICH I DID NOT THEN UNDERSTAND MR DICK SETS US ALL RIGHT HEAT THE BATH ALTHOUGH I WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THIS DIALOGUE I COULD NOT HELP OBSERVING MY AUNT MR DICK AND JANET WHILE IT WAS IN PROGRESS AND COMPLETING A SURVEY I HAD ALREADY BEEN ENGAGED IN MAKING OF THE ROOM MY AUNT WAS A TALL HARDFEATURED LADY BUT BY NO MEANS ILLLOOKING THERE WAS AN INFLEXIBILITY IN HER FACE IN HER VOICE IN HER GAIT AND CARRIAGE AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECT SHE HAD MADE UPON A GENTLE CREATURE LIKE MY MOTHER BUT HER FEATURES WERE RATHER HANDSOME THAN OTHERWISE THOUGH UNBENDING AND AUSTERE I PARTICULARLY NOTICED THAT SHE HAD A VERY QUICK BRIGHT EYE HER HAIR WHICH WAS GREY WAS ARRANGED IN TWO PLAIN DIVISIONS UNDER WHAT I BELIEVE WOULD BE CALLED A MOBCAP I MEAN A CAP MUCH MORE COMMON THEN THAN NOW WITH SIDEPIECES FASTENING UNDER THE CHIN HER DRESS WAS OF A LAVENDER COLOUR AND PERFECTLY NEAT BUT SCANTILY MADE AS IF SHE DESIRED TO BE AS LITTLE ENCUMBERED AS POSSIBLE I REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT IT IN FORM MORE LIKE A RIDINGHABIT WITH THE SUPERFLUOUS SKIRT CUT OFF THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHE WORE AT HER SIDE A GENTLEMANS GOLD WATCH IF I MIGHT JUDGE FROM ITS SIZE AND MAKE WITH AN APPROPRIATE CHAIN AND SEALS SHE HAD SOME LINEN AT HER THROAT NOT UNLIKE A SHIRTCOLLAR AND THINGS AT HER WRISTS LIKE LITTLE SHIRTWRISTBANDS MR DICK AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID WAS GREYHEADED AND FLORID I SHOULD HAVE SAID ALL ABOUT HIM IN SAYING SO HAD NOT HIS HEAD BEEN CURIOUSLY BOWEDNOT BY AGE IT REMINDED ME OF ONE OF MR CREAKLES BOYS HEADS AFTER A BEATINGAND HIS GREY EYES PROMINENT AND LARGE WITH A STRANGE KIND OF WATERY BRIGHTNESS IN THEM THAT MADE ME IN COMBINATION WITH HIS VACANT MANNER HIS SUBMISSION TO MY AUNT AND HIS CHILDISH DELIGHT WHEN SHE PRAISED HIM SUSPECT HIM OF BEING A LITTLE MAD THOUGH IF HE WERE MAD HOW HE CAME TO BE THERE PUZZLED ME EXTREMELY HE WAS DRESSED LIKE ANY OTHER ORDINARY GENTLEMAN IN A LOOSE GREY MORNING COAT AND WAISTCOAT AND WHITE TROUSERS AND HAD HIS WATCH IN HIS FOB AND HIS MONEY IN HIS POCKETS WHICH HE RATTLED AS IF HE WERE VERY PROUD OF IT JANET WAS A PRETTY BLOOMING GIRL OF ABOUT NINETEEN OR TWENTY AND A PERFECT PICTURE OF NEATNESS THOUGH I MADE NO FURTHER OBSERVATION OF HER AT THE MOMENT I MAY MENTION HERE WHAT I DID NOT DISCOVER UNTIL AFTERWARDS NAMELY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF A SERIES OF PROTEGEES WHOM MY AUNT HAD TAKEN INTO HER SERVICE EXPRESSLY TO EDUCATE IN A RENOUNCEMENT OF MANKIND AND WHO HAD GENERALLY COMPLETED THEIR ABJURATION BY MARRYING THE BAKER THE ROOM WAS AS NEAT AS JANET OR MY AUNT AS I LAID DOWN MY PEN A MOMENT SINCE TO THINK OF IT THE AIR FROM THE SEA CAME BLOWING IN AGAIN MIXED WITH THE PERFUME OF THE FLOWERS AND I SAW THE OLDFASHIONED FURNITURE BRIGHTLY RUBBED AND POLISHED MY AUNTS INVIOLABLE CHAIR AND TABLE BY THE ROUND GREEN FAN IN THE BOWWINDOW THE DRUGGETCOVERED CARPET THE CAT THE KETTLEHOLDER THE TWO CANARIES THE OLD CHINA THE PUNCHBOWL FULL OF DRIED ROSELEAVES THE TALL PRESS GUARDING ALL SORTS OF BOTTLES AND POTS AND WONDERFULLY OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE REST MY DUSTY SELF UPON THE SOFA TAKING NOTE OF EVERYTHING JANET HAD GONE AWAY TO GET THE BATH READY WHEN MY AUNT TO MY GREAT ALARM BECAME IN ONE MOMENT RIGID WITH INDIGNATION AND HAD HARDLY VOICE TO CRY OUT JANET DONKEYS UPON WHICH JANET CAME RUNNING UP THE STAIRS AS IF THE HOUSE WERE IN FLAMES DARTED OUT ON A LITTLE PIECE OF GREEN IN FRONT AND WARNED OFF TWO SADDLEDONKEYS LADYRIDDEN THAT HAD PRESUMED TO SET HOOF UPON IT WHILE MY AUNT RUSHING OUT OF THE HOUSE SEIZED THE BRIDLE OF A THIRD ANIMAL LADEN WITH A BESTRIDING CHILD TURNED HIM LED HIM FORTH FROM THOSE SACRED PRECINCTS AND BOXED THE EARS OF THE UNLUCKY URCHIN IN ATTENDANCE WHO HAD DARED TO PROFANE THAT HALLOWED GROUND TO THIS HOUR I DONT KNOW WHETHER MY AUNT HAD ANY LAWFUL RIGHT OF WAY OVER THAT PATCH OF GREEN BUT SHE HAD SETTLED IT IN HER OWN MIND THAT SHE HAD AND IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HER THE ONE GREAT OUTRAGE OF HER LIFE DEMANDING TO BE CONSTANTLY AVENGED WAS THE PASSAGE OF A DONKEY OVER THAT IMMACULATE SPOT IN WHATEVER OCCUPATION SHE WAS ENGAGED HOWEVER INTERESTING TO HER THE CONVERSATION IN WHICH SHE WAS TAKING PART A DONKEY TURNED THE CURRENT OF HER IDEAS IN A MOMENT AND SHE WAS UPON HIM STRAIGHT JUGS OF WATER AND WATERINGPOTS WERE KEPT IN SECRET PLACES READY TO BE DISCHARGED ON THE OFFENDING BOYS STICKS WERE LAID IN AMBUSH BEHIND THE DOOR SALLIES WERE MADE AT ALL HOURS AND INCESSANT WAR PREVAILED PERHAPS THIS WAS AN AGREEABLE EXCITEMENT TO THE DONKEYBOYS OR PERHAPS THE MORE SAGACIOUS OF THE DONKEYS UNDERSTANDING HOW THE CASE STOOD DELIGHTED WITH CONSTITUTIONAL OBSTINACY IN COMING THAT WAY I ONLY KNOW THAT THERE WERE THREE ALARMS BEFORE THE BATH WAS READY AND THAT ON THE OCCASION OF THE LAST AND MOST DESPERATE OF ALL I SAW MY AUNT ENGAGE SINGLEHANDED WITH A SANDYHEADED LAD OF FIFTEEN AND BUMP HIS SANDY HEAD AGAINST HER OWN GATE BEFORE HE SEEMED TO COMPREHEND WHAT WAS THE MATTER THESE INTERRUPTIONS WERE OF THE MORE RIDICULOUS TO ME BECAUSE SHE WAS GIVING ME BROTH OUT OF A TABLESPOON AT THE TIME HAVING FIRMLY PERSUADED HERSELF THAT I WAS ACTUALLY STARVING AND MUST RECEIVE NOURISHMENT AT FIRST IN VERY SMALL QUANTITIES AND WHILE MY MOUTH WAS YET OPEN TO RECEIVE THE SPOON SHE WOULD PUT IT BACK INTO THE BASIN CRY JANET DONKEYS AND GO OUT TO THE ASSAULT THE BATH WAS A GREAT COMFORT FOR I BEGAN TO BE SENSIBLE OF ACUTE PAINS IN MY LIMBS FROM LYING OUT IN THE FIELDS AND WAS NOW SO TIRED AND LOW THAT I COULD HARDLY KEEP MYSELF AWAKE FOR FIVE MINUTES TOGETHER WHEN I HAD BATHED THEY I MEAN MY AUNT AND JANET ENROBED ME IN A SHIRT AND A PAIR OF TROUSERS BELONGING TO MR DICK AND TIED ME UP IN TWO OR THREE GREAT SHAWLS WHAT SORT OF BUNDLE I LOOKED LIKE I DONT KNOW BUT I FELT A VERY HOT ONE FEELING ALSO VERY FAINT AND DROWSY I SOON LAY DOWN ON THE SOFA AGAIN AND FELL ASLEEP IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DREAM ORIGINATING IN THE FANCY WHICH HAD OCCUPIED MY MIND SO LONG BUT I AWOKE WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT MY AUNT HAD COME AND BENT OVER ME AND HAD PUT MY HAIR AWAY FROM MY FACE AND LAID MY HEAD MORE COMFORTABLY AND HAD THEN STOOD LOOKING AT ME THE WORDS PRETTY FELLOW OR POOR FELLOW SEEMED TO BE IN MY EARS TOO BUT CERTAINLY THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE WHEN I AWOKE TO LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAD BEEN UTTERED BY MY AUNT WHO SAT IN THE BOWWINDOW GAZING AT THE SEA FROM BEHIND THE GREEN FAN WHICH WAS MOUNTED ON A KIND OF SWIVEL AND TURNED ANY WAY WE DINED SOON AFTER I AWOKE OFF A ROAST FOWL AND A PUDDING I SITTING AT TABLE NOT UNLIKE A TRUSSED BIRD MYSELF AND MOVING MY ARMS WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY BUT AS MY AUNT HAD SWATHED ME UP I MADE NO COMPLAINT OF BEING INCONVENIENCED ALL THIS TIME I WAS DEEPLY ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO WITH ME BUT SHE TOOK HER DINNER IN PROFOUND SILENCE EXCEPT WHEN SHE OCCASIONALLY FIXED HER EYES ON ME SITTING OPPOSITE AND SAID MERCY UPON US WHICH DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RELIEVE MY ANXIETY THE CLOTH BEING DRAWN AND SOME SHERRY PUT UPON THE TABLE OF WHICH I HAD A GLASS MY AUNT SENT UP FOR MR DICK AGAIN WHO JOINED US AND LOOKED AS WISE AS HE COULD WHEN SHE REQUESTED HIM TO ATTEND TO MY STORY WHICH SHE ELICITED FROM ME GRADUALLY BY A COURSE OF QUESTIONS DURING MY RECITAL SHE KEPT HER EYES ON MR DICK WHO I THOUGHT WOULD HAVE GONE TO SLEEP BUT FOR THAT AND WHO WHENSOEVER HE LAPSED INTO A SMILE WAS CHECKED BY A FROWN FROM MY AUNT WHATEVER POSSESSED THAT POOR UNFORTUNATE BABY THAT SHE MUST GO AND BE MARRIED AGAIN SAID MY AUNT WHEN I HAD FINISHED I CANT CONCEIVE PERHAPS SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER SECOND HUSBAND MR DICK SUGGESTED FELL IN LOVE REPEATED MY AUNT WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT BUSINESS HAD SHE TO DO IT PERHAPS MR DICK SIMPERED AFTER THINKING A LITTLE SHE DID IT FOR PLEASURE PLEASURE INDEED REPLIED MY AUNT A MIGHTY PLEASURE FOR THE POOR BABY TO FIX HER SIMPLE FAITH UPON ANY DOG OF A FELLOW CERTAIN TO ILLUSE HER IN SOME WAY OR OTHER WHAT DID SHE PROPOSE TO HERSELF I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW SHE HAD HAD ONE HUSBAND SHE HAD SEEN DAVID COPPERFIELD OUT OF THE WORLD WHO WAS ALWAYS RUNNING AFTER WAX DOLLS FROM HIS CRADLE SHE HAD GOT A BABYOH THERE WERE A PAIR OF BABIES WHEN SHE GAVE BIRTH TO THIS CHILD SITTING HERE THAT FRIDAY NIGHTAND WHAT MORE DID SHE WANT MR DICK SECRETLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT ME AS IF HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO GETTING OVER THIS SHE COULDNT EVEN HAVE A BABY LIKE ANYBODY ELSE SAID MY AUNT WHERE WAS THIS CHILDS SISTER BETSEY TROTWOOD NOT FORTHCOMING DONT TELL ME MR DICK SEEMED QUITE FRIGHTENED THAT LITTLE MAN OF A DOCTOR WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE SAID MY AUNT JELLIPS OR WHATEVER HIS NAME WAS WHAT WAS HE ABOUT ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO SAY TO ME LIKE A ROBIN REDBREASTAS HE ISITS A BOY A BOY YAH THE IMBECILITY OF THE WHOLE SET OF EM THE HEARTINESS OF THE EJACULATION STARTLED MR DICK EXCEEDINGLY AND ME TOO IF I AM TO TELL THE TRUTH AND THEN AS IF THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH AND SHE HAD NOT STOOD SUFFICIENTLY IN THE LIGHT OF THIS CHILDS SISTER BETSEY TROTWOOD SAID MY AUNT SHE MARRIES A SECOND TIMEGOES AND MARRIES A MURDEREROR A MAN WITH A NAME LIKE ITAND STANDS IN THIS CHILDS LIGHT AND THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE IS AS ANYBODY BUT A BABY MIGHT HAVE FORESEEN THAT HE PROWLS AND WANDERS HES AS LIKE CAIN BEFORE HE WAS GROWN UP AS HE CAN BE MR DICK LOOKED HARD AT ME AS IF TO IDENTIFY ME IN THIS CHARACTER AND THEN THERES THAT WOMAN WITH THE PAGAN NAME SAID MY AUNT THAT PEGGOTTY SHE GOES AND GETS MARRIED NEXT BECAUSE SHE HAS NOT SEEN ENOUGH OF THE EVIL ATTENDING SUCH THINGS SHE GOES AND GETS MARRIED NEXT AS THE CHILD RELATES I ONLY HOPE SAID MY AUNT SHAKING HER HEAD THAT HER HUSBAND IS ONE OF THOSE POKER HUSBANDS WHO ABOUND IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND WILL BEAT HER WELL WITH ONE I COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR MY OLD NURSE SO DECRIED AND MADE THE SUBJECT OF SUCH A WISH I TOLD MY AUNT THAT INDEED SHE WAS MISTAKEN THAT PEGGOTTY WAS THE BEST THE TRUEST THE MOST FAITHFUL MOST DEVOTED AND MOST SELFDENYING FRIEND AND SERVANT IN THE WORLD WHO HAD EVER LOVED ME DEARLY WHO HAD EVER LOVED MY MOTHER DEARLY WHO HAD HELD MY MOTHERS DYING HEAD UPON HER ARM ON WHOSE FACE MY MOTHER HAD IMPRINTED HER LAST GRATEFUL KISS AND MY REMEMBRANCE OF THEM BOTH CHOKING ME I BROKE DOWN AS I WAS TRYING TO SAY THAT HER HOME WAS MY HOME AND THAT ALL SHE HAD WAS MINE AND THAT I WOULD HAVE GONE TO HER FOR SHELTER BUT FOR HER HUMBLE STATION WHICH MADE ME FEAR THAT I MIGHT BRING SOME TROUBLE ON HERI BROKE DOWN I SAY AS I WAS TRYING TO SAY SO AND LAID MY FACE IN MY HANDS UPON THE TABLE WELL WELL SAID MY AUNT THE CHILD IS RIGHT TO STAND BY THOSE WHO HAVE STOOD BY HIMJANET DONKEYS I THOROUGHLY BELIEVE THAT BUT FOR THOSE UNFORTUNATE DONKEYS WE SHOULD HAVE COME TO A GOOD UNDERSTANDING FOR MY AUNT HAD LAID HER HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND THE IMPULSE WAS UPON ME THUS EMBOLDENED TO EMBRACE HER AND BESEECH HER PROTECTION BUT THE INTERRUPTION AND THE DISORDER SHE WAS THROWN INTO BY THE STRUGGLE OUTSIDE PUT AN END TO ALL SOFTER IDEAS FOR THE PRESENT AND KEPT MY AUNT INDIGNANTLY DECLAIMING TO MR DICK ABOUT HER DETERMINATION TO APPEAL FOR REDRESS TO THE LAWS OF HER COUNTRY AND TO BRING ACTIONS FOR TRESPASS AGAINST THE WHOLE DONKEY PROPRIETORSHIP OF DOVER UNTIL TEATIME AFTER TEA WE SAT AT THE WINDOWON THE LOOKOUT AS I IMAGINED FROM MY AUNTS SHARP EXPRESSION OF FACE FOR MORE INVADERSUNTIL DUSK WHEN JANET SET CANDLES AND A BACKGAMMONBOARD ON THE TABLE AND PULLED DOWN THE BLINDS NOW MR DICK SAID MY AUNT WITH HER GRAVE LOOK AND HER FOREFINGER UP AS BEFORE I AM GOING TO ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION LOOK AT THIS CHILD DAVIDS SON SAID MR DICK WITH AN ATTENTIVE PUZZLED FACE EXACTLY SO RETURNED MY AUNT WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH HIM NOW DO WITH DAVIDS SON SAID MR DICK

BED IS READY WELL TAKE HIM UP TO IT JANET REPORTING IT TO BE QUITE READY I WAS TAKEN UP TO IT KINDLY BUT IN SOME SORT LIKE A PRISONER MY AUNT GOING IN FRONT AND JANET BRINGING UP THE REAR THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH GAVE ME ANY NEW HOPE WAS MY AUNTS STOPPING ON THE STAIRS TO INQUIRE ABOUT A SMELL OF FIRE THAT WAS PREVALENT THERE AND JANETS REPLYING THAT SHE HAD BEEN MAKING TINDER DOWN IN THE KITCHEN OF MY OLD SHIRT BUT THERE WERE NO OTHER CLOTHES IN MY ROOM THAN THE ODD HEAP OF THINGS I WORE AND WHEN I WAS LEFT THERE WITH A LITTLE TAPER WHICH MY AUNT FOREWARNED ME WOULD BURN EXACTLY FIVE MINUTES I HEARD THEM LOCK MY DOOR ON THE OUTSIDE TURNING THESE THINGS OVER IN MY MIND I DEEMED IT POSSIBLE THAT MY AUNT WHO COULD KNOW NOTHING OF ME MIGHT SUSPECT I HAD A HABIT OF RUNNING AWAY AND TOOK PRECAUTIONS ON THAT ACCOUNT TO HAVE ME IN SAFE KEEPING THE ROOM WAS A PLEASANT ONE AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE OVERLOOKING THE SEA ON WHICH THE MOON WAS SHINING BRILLIANTLY AFTER I HAD SAID MY PRAYERS AND THE CANDLE HAD BURNT OUT I REMEMBER HOW I STILL SAT LOOKING AT THE MOONLIGHT ON THE WATER AS IF I COULD HOPE TO READ MY FORTUNE IN IT AS IN A BRIGHT BOOK OR TO SEE MY MOTHER WITH HER CHILD COMING FROM HEAVEN ALONG THAT SHINING PATH TO LOOK UPON ME AS SHE HAD LOOKED WHEN I LAST SAW HER SWEET FACE I REMEMBER HOW THE SOLEMN FEELING WITH WHICH AT LENGTH I TURNED MY EYES AWAY YIELDED TO THE SENSATION OF GRATITUDE AND REST WHICH THE SIGHT OF THE WHITECURTAINED BEDAND HOW MUCH MORE THE LYING SOFTLY DOWN UPON IT NESTLING IN THE SNOWWHITE SHEETSINSPIRED I REMEMBER HOW I THOUGHT OF ALL THE SOLITARY PLACES UNDER THE NIGHT SKY WHERE I HAD SLEPT AND HOW I PRAYED THAT I NEVER MIGHT BE HOUSELESS ANY MORE AND NEVER MIGHT FORGET THE HOUSELESS I REMEMBER HOW I SEEMED TO FLOAT THEN DOWN THE MELANCHOLY GLORY OF THAT TRACK UPON THE SEA AWAY INTO THE WORLD OF DREAMS CHAPTER MY AUNT MAKES UP HER MIND ABOUT ME ON GOING DOWN IN THE MORNING I FOUND MY AUNT MUSING SO PROFOUNDLY OVER THE BREAKFAST TABLE WITH HER ELBOW ON THE TRAY THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE URN HAD OVERFLOWED THE TEAPOT AND WERE LAYING THE WHOLE TABLECLOTH UNDER WATER WHEN MY ENTRANCE PUT HER MEDITATIONS TO FLIGHT I FELT SURE THAT I HAD BEEN THE SUBJECT OF HER REFLECTIONS AND WAS MORE THAN EVER ANXIOUS TO KNOW HER INTENTIONS TOWARDS ME YET I DARED NOT EXPRESS MY ANXIETY LEST IT SHOULD GIVE HER OFFENCE MY EYES HOWEVER NOT BEING SO MUCH UNDER CONTROL AS MY TONGUE WERE ATTRACTED TOWARDS MY AUNT VERY OFTEN DURING BREAKFAST I NEVER COULD LOOK AT HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER BUT I FOUND HER LOOKING AT MEIN AN ODD THOUGHTFUL MANNER AS IF I WERE AN IMMENSE WAY OFF INSTEAD OF BEING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SMALL ROUND TABLE WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED HER BREAKFAST MY AUNT VERY DELIBERATELY LEANED BACK IN HER CHAIR KNITTED HER BROWS FOLDED HER ARMS AND CONTEMPLATED ME AT HER LEISURE WITH SUCH A FIXEDNESS OF ATTENTION THAT I WAS QUITE OVERPOWERED BY EMBARRASSMENT NOT HAVING AS YET FINISHED MY OWN BREAKFAST I ATTEMPTED TO HIDE MY CONFUSION BY PROCEEDING WITH IT BUT MY KNIFE TUMBLED OVER MY FORK MY FORK TRIPPED UP MY KNIFE I CHIPPED BITS OF BACON A SURPRISING HEIGHT INTO THE AIR INSTEAD OF CUTTING THEM FOR MY OWN EATING AND CHOKED MYSELF WITH MY TEA WHICH PERSISTED IN GOING THE WRONG WAY INSTEAD OF THE RIGHT ONE UNTIL I GAVE IN ALTOGETHER AND SAT BLUSHING UNDER MY AUNTS CLOSE SCRUTINY HALLO SAID MY AUNT AFTER A LONG TIME I LOOKED UP AND MET HER SHARP BRIGHT GLANCE RESPECTFULLY I HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM SAID MY AUNT TO TO YOUR FATHERINLAW SAID MY AUNT I HAVE SENT HIM A LETTER THAT ILL TROUBLE HIM TO

ELSE WHICH HE DONT SO TAKE CARE CHILD YOU DONT CALL HIM ANYTHING BUT MR DICK I PROMISED TO OBEY AND WENT UPSTAIRS WITH MY MESSAGE THINKING AS I WENT THAT IF MR DICK HAD BEEN WORKING AT HIS MEMORIAL LONG AT THE SAME RATE AS I HAD SEEN HIM WORKING AT IT THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR WHEN I CAME DOWN HE WAS PROBABLY GETTING ON VERY WELL INDEED I FOUND HIM STILL DRIVING AT IT WITH A LONG PEN AND HIS HEAD ALMOST LAID UPON THE PAPER HE WAS SO INTENT UPON IT THAT I HAD AMPLE LEISURE TO OBSERVE THE LARGE PAPER KITE IN A CORNER THE CONFUSION OF BUNDLES OF MANUSCRIPT THE NUMBER OF PENS AND ABOVE ALL THE QUANTITY OF INK WHICH HE SEEMED TO HAVE IN IN HALFGALLON JARS BY THE DOZEN BEFORE HE OBSERVED MY BEING PRESENT HA PHOEBUS SAID MR DICK LAYING DOWN HIS PEN HOW DOES THE WORLD GO ILL TELL YOU WHAT HE ADDED IN A LOWER TONE I SHOULDNT WISH IT TO BE MENTIONED BUT ITS A HERE HE BECKONED TO ME AND PUT HIS LIPS CLOSE TO MY EARITS A MAD WORLD MAD AS BEDLAM BOY SAID MR DICK TAKING SNUFF FROM A ROUND BOX ON THE TABLE AND LAUGHING HEARTILY WITHOUT PRESUMING TO GIVE MY OPINION ON THIS QUESTION I DELIVERED MY MESSAGE WELL SAID MR DICK IN ANSWER MY COMPLIMENTS TO HER AND II BELIEVE I HAVE MADE A START I THINK I HAVE MADE A START SAID MR DICK PASSING HIS HAND AMONG HIS GREY HAIR AND CASTING ANYTHING BUT A CONFIDENT LOOK AT HIS MANUSCRIPT YOU HAVE BEEN TO SCHOOL YES SIR I ANSWERED FOR A SHORT TIME DO YOU RECOLLECT THE DATE SAID MR DICK LOOKING EARNESTLY AT ME AND TAKING UP HIS PEN TO NOTE IT DOWN WHEN KING CHARLES THE FIRST HAD HIS HEAD CUT OFF I SAID I BELIEVED IT HAPPENED IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTYNINE WELL RETURNED MR DICK SCRATCHING HIS EAR WITH HIS PEN AND LOOKING DUBIOUSLY AT ME SO THE BOOKS SAY BUT I DONT SEE HOW THAT CAN BE BECAUSE IF IT WAS SO LONG AGO HOW COULD THE PEOPLE ABOUT HIM HAVE MADE THAT MISTAKE OF PUTTING SOME OF THE TROUBLE OUT OF HIS HEAD AFTER IT WAS TAKEN OFF INTO MINE I WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED BY THE INQUIRY BUT COULD GIVE NO INFORMATION ON THIS POINT ITS VERY STRANGE SAID MR DICK WITH A DESPONDENT LOOK UPON HIS PAPERS AND WITH HIS HAND AMONG HIS HAIR AGAIN THAT I NEVER CAN GET THAT QUITE RIGHT I NEVER CAN MAKE THAT PERFECTLY CLEAR BUT NO MATTER NO MATTER HE SAID CHEERFULLY AND ROUSING HIMSELF THERES TIME ENOUGH MY COMPLIMENTS TO MISS TROTWOOD I AM GETTING ON VERY WELL INDEED I WAS GOING AWAY WHEN HE DIRECTED MY ATTENTION TO THE KITE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT FOR A KITE HE SAID I ANSWERED THAT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL ONE I SHOULD THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN AS MUCH AS SEVEN FEET HIGH I MADE IT WELL GO AND FLY IT YOU AND I SAID MR DICK DO YOU SEE THIS HE SHOWED ME THAT IT WAS COVERED WITH MANUSCRIPT VERY CLOSELY AND LABORIOUSLY WRITTEN BUT SO PLAINLY THAT AS I LOOKED ALONG THE LINES I THOUGHT I SAW SOME ALLUSION TO KING CHARLES THE FIRSTS HEAD AGAIN IN ONE OR TWO PLACES THERES PLENTY OF STRING SAID MR DICK AND WHEN IT FLIES HIGH IT TAKES THE FACTS A LONG WAY THATS MY MANNER OF DIFFUSING EM I DONT KNOW WHERE THEY MAY COME DOWN ITS ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE WIND AND SO FORTH BUT I TAKE MY CHANCE OF THAT HIS FACE WAS SO VERY MILD AND PLEASANT AND HAD SOMETHING SO REVEREND IN IT THOUGH IT WAS HALE AND HEARTY THAT I WAS NOT SURE BUT THAT HE WAS HAVING A GOODHUMOURED JEST WITH ME SO I LAUGHED AND HE LAUGHED AND WE PARTED THE BEST FRIENDS POSSIBLE WELL CHILD SAID MY AUNT WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND WHAT OF MR DICK THIS MORNING I INFORMED HER THAT HE SENT HIS COMPLIMENTS AND WAS GETTING ON VERY WELL INDEED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM SAID MY AUNT I HAD SOME SHADOWY IDEA OF ENDEAVOURING TO EVADE THE QUESTION BY REPLYING THAT I THOUGHT HIM A VERY NICE GENTLEMAN BUT MY AUNT WAS NOT TO BE SO PUT OFF FOR SHE LAID HER WORK DOWN IN HER LAP AND SAID FOLDING HER HANDS UPON IT COME YOUR SISTER BETSEY TROTWOOD WOULD HAVE TOLD ME WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF ANYONE DIRECTLY BE AS LIKE YOUR SISTER AS YOU CAN AND SPEAK OUT IS HEIS MR DICKI ASK BECAUSE I DONT KNOW AUNTIS HE AT ALL OUT OF HIS MIND THEN I STAMMERED FOR I FELT I WAS ON DANGEROUS GROUND NOT A MORSEL SAID MY AUNT OH INDEED I OBSERVED FAINTLY IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THE WORLD SAID MY AUNT WITH GREAT DECISION AND FORCE OF MANNER THAT MR DICK IS NOT ITS THAT I HAD NOTHING BETTER TO OFFER THAN ANOTHER TIMID OH INDEED HE HAS BEEN CALLED MAD SAID MY AUNT I HAVE A SELFISH PLEASURE IN SAYING HE HAS BEEN CALLED MAD OR I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF HIS SOCIETY AND ADVICE FOR THESE LAST TEN YEARS AND UPWARDSIN FACT EVER SINCE YOUR SISTER BETSEY TROTWOOD DISAPPOINTED ME SO LONG AS THAT I SAID AND NICE PEOPLE THEY WERE WHO HAD THE AUDACITY TO CALL HIM MAD PURSUED MY AUNT MR DICK IS A SORT OF DISTANT CONNEXION OF MINEIT DOESNT MATTER HOW I NEEDNT ENTER INTO THAT IF IT HADNT BEEN FOR ME HIS OWN BROTHER WOULD HAVE SHUT HIM UP FOR LIFE THATS ALL I AM AFRAID IT WAS HYPOCRITICAL IN ME BUT SEEING THAT MY AUNT FELT STRONGLY ON THE SUBJECT I TRIED TO LOOK AS IF I FELT STRONGLY TOO A PROUD FOOL SAID MY AUNT BECAUSE HIS BROTHER WAS A LITTLE ECCENTRICTHOUGH HE IS NOT HALF SO ECCENTRIC AS A GOOD MANY PEOPLEHE DIDNT LIKE TO HAVE HIM VISIBLE ABOUT HIS HOUSE AND SENT HIM AWAY TO SOME PRIVATE ASYLUMPLACE THOUGH HE HAD BEEN LEFT TO HIS PARTICULAR CARE BY THEIR DECEASED FATHER WHO THOUGHT HIM ALMOST A NATURAL AND A WISE MAN HE MUST HAVE BEEN TO THINK SO MAD HIMSELF NO DOUBT AGAIN AS MY AUNT LOOKED QUITE CONVINCED I ENDEAVOURED TO LOOK QUITE CONVINCED ALSO SO I STEPPED IN SAID MY AUNT AND MADE HIM AN OFFER I SAID YOUR BROTHERS SANEA GREAT DEAL MORE SANE THAN YOU ARE OR EVER WILL BE IT IS TO BE HOPED LET HIM HAVE HIS LITTLE INCOME AND COME AND LIVE WITH ME I AM NOT AFRAID OF HIM I AM NOT PROUD I AM READY TO TAKE CARE OF HIM AND SHALL NOT ILLTREAT HIM AS SOME PEOPLE BESIDES THE ASYLUMFOLKS HAVE DONE AFTER A GOOD DEAL OF SQUABBLING SAID MY AUNT I GOT HIM AND HE HAS BEEN HERE EVER SINCE HE IS THE MOST FRIENDLY AND AMENABLE CREATURE IN EXISTENCE AND AS FOR ADVICEBUT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT MANS MIND IS EXCEPT MYSELF MY AUNT SMOOTHED HER DRESS AND SHOOK HER HEAD AS IF SHE SMOOTHED DEFIANCE OF THE WHOLE WORLD OUT OF THE ONE AND SHOOK IT OUT OF THE OTHER HE HAD A FAVOURITE SISTER SAID MY AUNT A GOOD CREATURE AND VERY KIND TO HIM BUT SHE DID WHAT THEY ALL DOTOOK A HUSBAND AND HE DID WHAT THEY ALL DOMADE HER WRETCHED IT HAD SUCH AN EFFECT UPON THE MIND OF MR DICK THATS NOT MADNESS I HOPE THAT COMBINED WITH HIS FEAR OF HIS BROTHER AND HIS SENSE OF HIS UNKINDNESS IT THREW HIM INTO A FEVER THAT WAS BEFORE HE CAME TO ME BUT THE RECOLLECTION OF IT IS OPPRESSIVE TO HIM EVEN NOW DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT KING CHARLES THE FIRST CHILD YES AUNT AH SAID MY AUNT RUBBING HER NOSE AS IF SHE WERE A LITTLE VEXED THATS HIS ALLEGORICAL WAY OF EXPRESSING IT HE CONNECTS HIS ILLNESS WITH GREAT DISTURBANCE AND AGITATION NATURALLY AND THATS THE FIGURE OR THE SIMILE OR WHATEVER ITS CALLED WHICH HE CHOOSES TO USE AND WHY SHOULDNT HE IF HE THINKS PROPER I SAID CERTAINLY AUNT ITS NOT A BUSINESSLIKE WAY OF SPEAKING SAID MY AUNT NOR A WORLDLY WAY I AM AWARE OF THAT AND THATS THE REASON WHY I INSIST UPON IT THAT THERE SHANT BE A WORD ABOUT IT IN HIS MEMORIAL IS IT A MEMORIAL ABOUT HIS OWN HISTORY THAT HE IS WRITING AUNT YES CHILD SAID MY AUNT RUBBING HER NOSE AGAIN HE IS MEMORIALIZING THE LORD CHANCELLOR OR THE LORD SOMEBODY OR OTHERONE OF THOSE PEOPLE AT ALL EVENTS WHO ARE PAID TO BE MEMORIALIZEDABOUT HIS AFFAIRS I SUPPOSE IT WILL GO IN ONE OF THESE DAYS HE HASNT BEEN ABLE TO DRAW IT UP YET WITHOUT INTRODUCING THAT MODE OF EXPRESSING HIMSELF BUT IT DONT SIGNIFY IT KEEPS HIM EMPLOYED IN FACT I FOUND OUT AFTERWARDS THAT MR DICK HAD BEEN FOR UPWARDS OF TEN YEARS ENDEAVOURING TO KEEP KING CHARLES THE FIRST OUT OF THE MEMORIAL BUT HE HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY GETTING INTO IT AND WAS THERE NOW I SAY AGAIN SAID MY AUNT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT MANS MIND IS EXCEPT MYSELF AND HES THE MOST AMENABLE AND FRIENDLY CREATURE IN EXISTENCE IF HE LIKES TO FLY A KITE SOMETIMES WHAT OF THAT FRANKLIN USED TO FLY A KITE HE WAS A QUAKER OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN AND A QUAKER FLYING A KITE IS A MUCH MORE RIDICULOUS OBJECT THAN ANYBODY ELSE IF I COULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT MY AUNT HAD RECOUNTED THESE PARTICULARS FOR MY ESPECIAL BEHOOF AND AS A PIECE OF CONFIDENCE IN ME I SHOULD HAVE FELT VERY MUCH DISTINGUISHED AND SHOULD HAVE AUGURED FAVOURABLY FROM SUCH A MARK OF HER GOOD OPINION BUT I COULD HARDLY HELP OBSERVING THAT SHE HAD LAUNCHED INTO THEM CHIEFLY BECAUSE THE QUESTION WAS RAISED IN HER OWN MIND AND WITH VERY LITTLE REFERENCE TO ME THOUGH SHE HAD ADDRESSED HERSELF TO ME IN THE ABSENCE OF ANYBODY ELSE AT THE SAME TIME I MUST SAY THAT THE GENEROSITY OF HER CHAMPIONSHIP OF POOR HARMLESS MR DICK NOT ONLY INSPIRED MY YOUNG BREAST WITH SOME SELFISH HOPE FOR MYSELF BUT WARMED IT UNSELFISHLY TOWARDS HER I BELIEVE THAT I BEGAN TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT MY AUNT NOTWITHSTANDING HER MANY ECCENTRICITIES AND ODD HUMOURS TO BE HONOURED AND TRUSTED IN THOUGH SHE WAS JUST AS SHARP THAT DAY AS ON THE DAY BEFORE AND WAS IN AND OUT ABOUT THE DONKEYS JUST AS OFTEN AND WAS THROWN INTO A TREMENDOUS STATE OF INDIGNATION WHEN A YOUNG MAN GOING BY OGLED JANET AT A WINDOW WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GRAVEST MISDEMEANOURS THAT COULD BE COMMITTED AGAINST MY AUNTS DIGNITY SHE SEEMED TO ME TO COMMAND MORE OF MY RESPECT IF NOT LESS OF MY FEAR THE ANXIETY I UNDERWENT IN THE INTERVAL WHICH NECESSARILY ELAPSED BEFORE A REPLY COULD BE RECEIVED TO HER LETTER TO MR MURDSTONE WAS EXTREME BUT I MADE AN ENDEAVOUR TO SUPPRESS IT AND TO BE AS AGREEABLE AS I COULD IN A QUIET WAY BOTH TO MY AUNT AND MR DICK THE LATTER AND I WOULD HAVE GONE OUT TO FLY THE GREAT KITE BUT THAT I HAD STILL NO OTHER CLOTHES THAN THE ANYTHING BUT ORNAMENTAL GARMENTS WITH WHICH I HAD BEEN DECORATED ON THE FIRST DAY AND WHICH CONFINED ME TO THE HOUSE EXCEPT FOR AN HOUR AFTER DARK WHEN MY AUNT FOR MY HEALTHS SAKE PARADED ME UP AND DOWN ON THE CLIFF OUTSIDE BEFORE GOING TO BED AT LENGTH THE REPLY FROM MR MURDSTONE CAME AND MY AUNT INFORMED ME TO MY INFINITE TERROR THAT HE WAS COMING TO SPEAK TO HER HERSELF ON THE NEXT DAY ON THE NEXT DAY STILL BUNDLED UP IN MY CURIOUS HABILIMENTS I SAT COUNTING THE TIME FLUSHED AND HEATED BY THE CONFLICT OF SINKING HOPES AND RISING FEARS WITHIN ME AND WAITING TO BE STARTLED BY THE SIGHT OF THE GLOOMY FACE WHOSE NONARRIVAL STARTLED ME EVERY MINUTE MY AUNT WAS A LITTLE MORE IMPERIOUS AND STERN THAN USUAL BUT I OBSERVED NO OTHER TOKEN OF HER PREPARING HERSELF TO RECEIVE THE VISITOR SO MUCH DREADED BY ME SHE SAT AT WORK IN THE WINDOW AND I SAT BY WITH MY THOUGHTS RUNNING ASTRAY ON ALL POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE RESULTS OF MR MURDSTONES VISIT UNTIL PRETTY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OUR DINNER HAD BEEN INDEFINITELY POSTPONED BUT IT WAS GROWING SO LATE THAT MY AUNT HAD ORDERED IT TO BE GOT READY WHEN SHE GAVE A SUDDEN ALARM OF DONKEYS AND TO MY CONSTERNATION AND AMAZEMENT I BEHELD MISS MURDSTONE ON A SIDESADDLE RIDE DELIBERATELY OVER THE SACRED PIECE OF GREEN AND STOP IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE LOOKING ABOUT HER GO ALONG WITH YOU CRIED MY AUNT SHAKING HER HEAD AND HER FIST AT THE WINDOW YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS THERE HOW DARE YOU TRESPASS GO ALONG OH YOU BOLDFACED THING MY AUNT WAS SO EXASPERATED BY THE COOLNESS WITH WHICH MISS MURDSTONE LOOKED ABOUT HER THAT I REALLY BELIEVE SHE WAS MOTIONLESS AND UNABLE FOR THE MOMENT TO DART OUT ACCORDING TO CUSTOM I SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM HER WHO IT WAS AND THAT THE GENTLEMAN NOW COMING NEAR THE OFFENDER FOR THE WAY UP WAS VERY STEEP AND HE HAD DROPPED BEHIND WAS MR MURDSTONE HIMSELF I DONT CARE WHO IT IS CRIED MY AUNT STILL SHAKING HER HEAD AND GESTICULATING ANYTHING BUT WELCOME FROM THE BOWWINDOW I WONT BE TRESPASSED UPON I WONT ALLOW IT GO AWAY JANET TURN HIM ROUND LEAD HIM OFF AND I SAW FROM BEHIND MY AUNT A SORT OF HURRIED BATTLEPIECE IN WHICH THE DONKEY STOOD RESISTING EVERYBODY WITH ALL HIS FOUR LEGS PLANTED DIFFERENT WAYS WHILE JANET TRIED TO PULL HIM ROUND BY THE BRIDLE MR MURDSTONE TRIED TO LEAD HIM ON MISS MURDSTONE STRUCK AT JANET WITH A PARASOL AND SEVERAL BOYS WHO HAD COME TO SEE THE ENGAGEMENT SHOUTED VIGOROUSLY BUT MY AUNT SUDDENLY DESCRYING AMONG THEM THE YOUNG MALEFACTOR WHO WAS THE DONKEYS GUARDIAN AND WHO WAS ONE OF THE MOST INVETERATE OFFENDERS AGAINST HER THOUGH HARDLY IN HIS TEENS RUSHED OUT TO THE SCENE OF ACTION POUNCED UPON HIM CAPTURED HIM DRAGGED HIM WITH HIS JACKET OVER HIS HEAD AND HIS HEELS GRINDING THE GROUND INTO THE GARDEN AND CALLING UPON JANET TO FETCH THE CONSTABLES AND JUSTICES THAT HE MIGHT BE TAKEN TRIED AND EXECUTED ON THE SPOT HELD HIM AT BAY THERE THIS PART OF THE BUSINESS HOWEVER DID NOT LAST LONG FOR THE YOUNG RASCAL BEING EXPERT AT A VARIETY OF FEINTS AND DODGES OF WHICH MY AUNT HAD NO CONCEPTION SOON WENT WHOOPING AWAY LEAVING SOME DEEP IMPRESSIONS OF HIS NAILED BOOTS IN THE FLOWERBEDS AND TAKING HIS DONKEY IN TRIUMPH WITH HIM MISS MURDSTONE DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF THE CONTEST HAD DISMOUNTED AND WAS NOW WAITING WITH HER BROTHER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS UNTIL MY AUNT SHOULD BE AT LEISURE TO RECEIVE THEM MY AUNT A LITTLE RUFFLED BY THE COMBAT MARCHED PAST THEM INTO THE HOUSE WITH GREAT DIGNITY AND TOOK NO NOTICE OF THEIR PRESENCE UNTIL THEY WERE ANNOUNCED BY JANET SHALL I GO AWAY AUNT I ASKED TREMBLING NO SIR SAID MY AUNT CERTAINLY NOT WITH WHICH SHE PUSHED ME INTO A CORNER NEAR HER AND FENCED ME IN WITH A CHAIR AS IF IT WERE A PRISON OR A BAR OF JUSTICE THIS POSITION I CONTINUED TO OCCUPY DURING THE WHOLE INTERVIEW AND FROM IT I NOW SAW MR AND MISS MURDSTONE ENTER THE ROOM OH SAID MY AUNT I WAS NOT AWARE AT FIRST TO WHOM I HAD THE PLEASURE OF OBJECTING BUT I DONT ALLOW ANYBODY TO RIDE OVER THAT TURF I MAKE NO EXCEPTIONS I DONT ALLOW ANYBODY TO DO IT YOUR REGULATION IS RATHER AWKWARD TO STRANGERS

THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH BETTER AND HAPPIER THING IF YOU HAD LEFT THAT POOR CHILD ALONE I SO FAR AGREE WITH WHAT MISS TROTWOOD HAS REMARKED OBSERVED MISS MURDSTONE BRIDLING THAT I CONSIDER OUR LAMENTED CLARA TO HAVE BEEN IN ALL ESSENTIAL RESPECTS A MERE CHILD IT IS A COMFORT TO YOU AND ME MAAM SAID MY AUNT WHO ARE GETTING ON IN LIFE AND ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE MADE UNHAPPY BY OUR PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS THAT NOBODY CAN SAY THE SAME OF US NO DOUBT RETURNED MISS MURDSTONE THOUGH I THOUGHT NOT WITH A VERY READY OR GRACIOUS ASSENT AND IT CERTAINLY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS YOU SAY A BETTER AND HAPPIER THING FOR MY BROTHER IF HE HAD NEVER ENTERED INTO SUCH A MARRIAGE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OF THAT OPINION I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU HAVE SAID MY AUNT JANET RINGING THE BELL MY COMPLIMENTS TO MR DICK AND BEG HIM TO COME DOWN UNTIL HE CAME MY AUNT SAT PERFECTLY UPRIGHT AND STIFF FROWNING AT THE WALL WHEN HE CAME MY AUNT PERFORMED THE CEREMONY OF INTRODUCTION MR DICK AN OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND ON WHOSE JUDGEMENT SAID MY AUNT WITH EMPHASIS AS AN ADMONITION TO MR DICK WHO WAS BITING HIS FOREFINGER AND LOOKING RATHER FOOLISH I RELY MR DICK TOOK HIS FINGER OUT OF HIS MOUTH ON THIS HINT AND STOOD AMONG THE GROUP WITH A GRAVE AND ATTENTIVE EXPRESSION OF FACE MY AUNT INCLINED HER HEAD TO MR MURDSTONE WHO WENT ON MISS TROTWOOD ON THE RECEIPT OF YOUR LETTER I CONSIDERED IT AN ACT OF GREATER JUSTICE TO MYSELF AND PERHAPS OF MORE RESPECT TO YOU THANK YOU SAID MY AUNT STILL EYEING HIM KEENLY YOU NEEDNT MIND ME TO ANSWER IT IN PERSON HOWEVER INCONVENIENT THE JOURNEY PURSUED MR MURDSTONE RATHER THAN BY LETTER THIS UNHAPPY BOY WHO HAS RUN AWAY FROM HIS FRIENDS AND HIS OCCUPATION AND WHOSE APPEARANCE INTERPOSED HIS SISTER DIRECTING GENERAL ATTENTION TO ME IN MY INDEFINABLE COSTUME IS PERFECTLY SCANDALOUS AND DISGRACEFUL JANE MURDSTONE SAID HER BROTHER HAVE THE GOODNESS NOT TO INTERRUPT ME THIS UNHAPPY BOY MISS TROTWOOD HAS BEEN THE OCCASION OF MUCH DOMESTIC TROUBLE AND UNEASINESS BOTH

THE CURRENT OF MY AUNTS ADDRESS TOWARDS HERSELF AND MY SUSPICION IS THAT ITS INTOXICATION MISS BETSEY WITHOUT TAKING THE LEAST NOTICE OF THE INTERRUPTION CONTINUED TO ADDRESS HERSELF TO MR MURDSTONE AS IF THERE HAD BEEN NO SUCH THING MR MURDSTONE SHE SAID SHAKING HER FINGER AT HIM YOU WERE A TYRANT TO THE SIMPLE BABY AND YOU BROKE HER HEART SHE WAS A LOVING BABYI KNOW THAT I KNEW IT YEARS BEFORE

REMOTENESS HAD COME UPON THE OLD BLUNDERSTONE LIFEWHICH SEEMED TO LIE IN THE HAZE OF AN IMMEASURABLE DISTANCE AND THAT A CURTAIN HAD FOR EVER FALLEN ON MY LIFE AT MURDSTONE AND GRINBYS NO ONE HAS EVER RAISED THAT CURTAIN SINCE I HAVE LIFTED IT FOR A MOMENT EVEN IN THIS NARRATIVE WITH A RELUCTANT HAND AND DROPPED IT GLADLY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT LIFE IS FRAUGHT WITH SO MUCH PAIN TO ME WITH SO MUCH MENTAL SUFFERING AND WANT OF HOPE THAT I HAVE NEVER HAD THE COURAGE EVEN TO EXAMINE HOW LONG I WAS DOOMED TO LEAD IT WHETHER IT LASTED FOR A YEAR OR MORE OR LESS I DO NOT KNOW I ONLY KNOW THAT IT WAS AND CEASED TO BE AND THAT I HAVE WRITTEN AND THERE I LEAVE IT CHAPTER I MAKE ANOTHER BEGINNING MR DICK AND I SOON BECAME THE BEST OF FRIENDS AND VERY OFTEN WHEN HIS DAYS WORK WAS DONE WENT OUT TOGETHER TO FLY THE GREAT KITE EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE HE HAD A LONG SITTING AT THE MEMORIAL WHICH NEVER MADE THE LEAST PROGRESS HOWEVER HARD HE LABOURED FOR KING CHARLES THE FIRST ALWAYS STRAYED INTO IT SOONER OR LATER AND THEN IT WAS THROWN ASIDE AND ANOTHER ONE BEGUN THE PATIENCE AND HOPE WITH WHICH HE BORE THESE PERPETUAL DISAPPOINTMENTS THE MILD PERCEPTION HE HAD THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT KING CHARLES THE FIRST THE FEEBLE EFFORTS HE MADE TO KEEP HIM OUT AND THE CERTAINTY WITH WHICH HE CAME IN AND TUMBLED THE MEMORIAL OUT OF ALL SHAPE MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION ON ME WHAT MR DICK SUPPOSED WOULD COME OF THE MEMORIAL IF IT WERE COMPLETED WHERE HE THOUGHT IT WAS TO GO OR WHAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS TO DO HE KNEW NO MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE I BELIEVE NOR WAS IT AT ALL NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD TROUBLE HIMSELF WITH SUCH QUESTIONS FOR IF ANYTHING WERE CERTAIN UNDER THE SUN IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THE MEMORIAL NEVER WOULD BE FINISHED IT WAS QUITE AN AFFECTING SIGHT I USED TO THINK TO SEE HIM WITH THE KITE WHEN IT WAS UP A GREAT HEIGHT IN THE AIR WHAT HE HAD TOLD ME IN HIS ROOM ABOUT HIS BELIEF IN ITS DISSEMINATING THE STATEMENTS PASTED ON IT WHICH WERE NOTHING BUT OLD LEAVES OF ABORTIVE MEMORIALS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A FANCY WITH HIM SOMETIMES BUT NOT WHEN HE WAS OUT LOOKING UP AT THE KITE IN THE SKY AND FEELING IT PULL AND TUG AT HIS HAND HE NEVER LOOKED SO SERENE AS HE DID THEN I USED TO FANCY AS I SAT BY HIM OF AN EVENING ON A GREEN SLOPE AND SAW HIM WATCH THE KITE HIGH IN THE QUIET AIR THAT IT LIFTED HIS MIND OUT OF ITS CONFUSION AND BORE IT SUCH WAS MY BOYISH THOUGHT INTO THE SKIES AS HE WOUND THE STRING IN AND IT CAME LOWER AND LOWER DOWN OUT OF THE BEAUTIFUL LIGHT UNTIL IT FLUTTERED TO THE GROUND AND LAY THERE LIKE A DEAD THING HE SEEMED TO WAKE GRADUALLY OUT OF A DREAM AND I REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN HIM TAKE IT UP AND LOOK ABOUT HIM IN A LOST WAY AS IF THEY HAD BOTH COME DOWN TOGETHER SO THAT I PITIED HIM WITH ALL MY HEART WHILE I ADVANCED IN FRIENDSHIP AND INTIMACY WITH MR DICK I DID NOT GO BACKWARD IN THE FAVOUR OF HIS STAUNCH FRIEND MY AUNT SHE TOOK SO KINDLY TO ME THAT IN THE COURSE OF A FEW WEEKS SHE SHORTENED MY ADOPTED NAME OF TROTWOOD INTO TROT AND EVEN ENCOURAGED ME TO HOPE THAT IF I WENT ON AS I HAD BEGUN I MIGHT TAKE EQUAL RANK IN HER AFFECTIONS WITH MY SISTER BETSEY TROTWOOD TROT SAID MY AUNT ONE EVENING WHEN THE BACKGAMMONBOARD WAS PLACED AS USUAL FOR HERSELF AND MR DICK WE MUST NOT FORGET YOUR EDUCATION THIS WAS MY ONLY SUBJECT OF ANXIETY AND I FELT QUITE DELIGHTED BY HER REFERRING TO IT SHOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO SCHOOL AT CANTERBURY SAID MY AUNT I REPLIED THAT I SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH AS IT WAS SO NEAR HER GOOD SAID MY AUNT SHOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TOMORROW BEING ALREADY NO STRANGER TO THE GENERAL RAPIDITY OF MY AUNTS EVOLUTIONS I WAS NOT SURPRISED BY THE SUDDENNESS OF THE PROPOSAL AND SAID YES GOOD SAID MY AUNT AGAIN JANET HIRE THE GREY PONY AND CHAISE TOMORROW MORNING AT TEN OCLOCK AND PACK UP MASTER TROTWOODS CLOTHES TONIGHT I WAS GREATLY ELATED BY THESE ORDERS BUT MY HEART SMOTE ME FOR MY SELFISHNESS WHEN I WITNESSED THEIR EFFECT ON MR DICK WHO WAS SO LOWSPIRITED AT THE PROSPECT OF OUR SEPARATION AND PLAYED SO ILL IN CONSEQUENCE THAT MY AUNT AFTER GIVING HIM SEVERAL ADMONITORY RAPS ON THE KNUCKLES WITH HER DICEBOX SHUT UP THE BOARD AND DECLINED TO PLAY WITH HIM ANY MORE BUT ON HEARING FROM MY AUNT THAT I SHOULD SOMETIMES COME OVER ON A SATURDAY AND THAT HE COULD SOMETIMES COME AND SEE ME ON A WEDNESDAY HE REVIVED AND VOWED TO MAKE ANOTHER KITE FOR THOSE OCCASIONS OF PROPORTIONS GREATLY SURPASSING THE PRESENT ONE IN THE MORNING HE WAS DOWNHEARTED AGAIN AND WOULD HAVE SUSTAINED HIMSELF BY GIVING ME ALL THE MONEY HE HAD IN HIS POSSESSION GOLD AND SILVER TOO IF MY AUNT HAD NOT INTERPOSED AND LIMITED THE GIFT TO FIVE SHILLINGS WHICH AT HIS EARNEST PETITION WERE AFTERWARDS INCREASED TO TEN WE PARTED AT THE GARDENGATE IN A MOST AFFECTIONATE MANNER AND MR DICK DID NOT GO INTO THE HOUSE UNTIL MY AUNT HAD DRIVEN ME OUT OF SIGHT OF IT MY AUNT WHO WAS PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT TO PUBLIC OPINION DROVE THE GREY PONY THROUGH DOVER IN A MASTERLY MANNER SITTING HIGH AND STIFF LIKE A STATE COACHMAN KEEPING A STEADY EYE UPON HIM WHEREVER HE WENT AND MAKING A POINT OF NOT LETTING HIM HAVE HIS OWN WAY IN ANY RESPECT WHEN WE CAME INTO THE COUNTRY ROAD SHE PERMITTED HIM TO RELAX A LITTLE HOWEVER AND LOOKING AT ME DOWN IN A VALLEY OF CUSHION BY HER SIDE ASKED ME WHETHER I WAS HAPPY VERY HAPPY INDEED THANK YOU AUNT I SAID SHE WAS MUCH GRATIFIED AND BOTH HER HANDS BEING OCCUPIED PATTED ME ON THE HEAD WITH HER WHIP IS IT A LARGE SCHOOL AUNT I ASKED WHY I DONT KNOW SAID MY AUNT WE ARE GOING TO MR WICKFIELDS FIRST DOES HE KEEP A SCHOOL I ASKED NO TROT SAID MY AUNT HE KEEPS AN OFFICE I ASKED FOR NO MORE INFORMATION ABOUT MR WICKFIELD AS SHE OFFERED NONE AND WE CONVERSED ON OTHER SUBJECTS UNTIL WE CAME TO CANTERBURY WHERE AS IT WAS MARKETDAY MY AUNT HAD A GREAT OPPORTUNITY OF INSINUATING THE GREY PONY AMONG CARTS BASKETS VEGETABLES AND HUCKSTERS GOODS THE HAIRBREADTH TURNS AND TWISTS WE MADE DREW DOWN UPON US A VARIETY OF SPEECHES FROM THE PEOPLE STANDING ABOUT WHICH WERE NOT ALWAYS COMPLIMENTARY BUT MY AUNT DROVE ON WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE AND I DARE SAY WOULD HAVE TAKEN HER OWN WAY WITH AS MUCH COOLNESS THROUGH AN ENEMYS COUNTRY AT LENGTH WE STOPPED BEFORE A VERY OLD HOUSE BULGING OUT OVER THE ROAD A HOUSE WITH LONG LOW LATTICEWINDOWS BULGING OUT STILL FARTHER AND BEAMS WITH CARVED HEADS ON THE ENDS BULGING OUT TOO SO THAT I FANCIED THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS LEANING FORWARD TRYING TO SEE WHO WAS PASSING ON THE NARROW PAVEMENT BELOW IT WAS QUITE SPOTLESS IN ITS CLEANLINESS THE OLDFASHIONED BRASS KNOCKER ON THE LOW ARCHED DOOR ORNAMENTED WITH CARVED GARLANDS OF FRUIT AND FLOWERS TWINKLED LIKE A STAR THE TWO STONE STEPS DESCENDING TO THE DOOR WERE AS WHITE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN COVERED WITH FAIR LINEN AND ALL THE ANGLES AND CORNERS AND CARVINGS AND MOULDINGS AND QUAINT LITTLE PANES OF GLASS AND QUAINTER LITTLE WINDOWS THOUGH AS OLD AS THE HILLS WERE AS PURE AS ANY SNOW THAT EVER FELL UPON THE HILLS WHEN THE PONYCHAISE STOPPED AT THE DOOR AND MY EYES WERE INTENT UPON THE HOUSE I SAW A CADAVEROUS FACE APPEAR AT A SMALL WINDOW ON THE GROUND FLOOR IN A LITTLE ROUND TOWER THAT FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND QUICKLY DISAPPEAR THE LOW ARCHED DOOR THEN OPENED AND THE FACE CAME OUT IT WAS QUITE AS CADAVEROUS AS IT HAD LOOKED IN THE WINDOW THOUGH IN THE GRAIN OF IT THERE WAS THAT TINGE OF RED WHICH IS SOMETIMES TO BE OBSERVED IN THE SKINS OF REDHAIRED PEOPLE IT BELONGED TO A REDHAIRED PERSONA YOUTH OF FIFTEEN AS I TAKE IT NOW BUT LOOKING MUCH OLDERWHOSE HAIR WAS CROPPED AS CLOSE AS THE CLOSEST STUBBLE WHO HAD HARDLY ANY EYEBROWS AND NO EYELASHES AND EYES OF A REDBROWN SO UNSHELTERED AND UNSHADED THAT I REMEMBER WONDERING HOW HE WENT TO SLEEP HE WAS HIGHSHOULDERED AND BONY DRESSED IN DECENT BLACK WITH A WHITE WISP OF A NECKCLOTH BUTTONED UP TO THE THROAT AND HAD A LONG LANK SKELETON HAND WHICH PARTICULARLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION AS HE STOOD AT THE PONYS HEAD RUBBING HIS CHIN WITH IT AND LOOKING UP AT US IN THE CHAISE IS MR WICKFIELD AT HOME URIAH HEEP SAID MY AUNT MR WICKFIELDS AT HOME MAAM SAID URIAH HEEP IF YOULL PLEASE TO WALK IN THEREPOINTING WITH HIS LONG HAND TO THE ROOM HE MEANT WE GOT OUT AND LEAVING HIM TO HOLD THE PONY WENT INTO A LONG LOW PARLOUR LOOKING TOWARDS THE STREET FROM THE WINDOW OF WHICH I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE AS I WENT IN OF URIAH HEEP BREATHING INTO THE PONYS NOSTRILS AND IMMEDIATELY COVERING THEM WITH HIS HAND AS IF HE WERE PUTTING SOME SPELL UPON HIM OPPOSITE TO THE TALL OLD CHIMNEYPIECE WERE TWO PORTRAITS ONE OF A GENTLEMAN WITH GREY HAIR THOUGH NOT BY ANY MEANS AN OLD MAN AND BLACK EYEBROWS WHO WAS LOOKING OVER SOME PAPERS TIED TOGETHER WITH RED TAPE THE OTHER OF A LADY WITH A VERY PLACID AND SWEET EXPRESSION OF FACE WHO WAS LOOKING AT ME I BELIEVE I WAS TURNING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF URIAHS PICTURE WHEN A DOOR AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM OPENING A GENTLEMAN ENTERED AT SIGHT OF WHOM I TURNED TO THE FIRSTMENTIONED PORTRAIT AGAIN TO MAKE QUITE SURE THAT IT HAD NOT COME OUT OF ITS FRAME BUT IT WAS STATIONARY AND AS THE GENTLEMAN ADVANCED INTO THE LIGHT I SAW THAT HE WAS SOME YEARS OLDER THAN WHEN HE HAD HAD HIS PICTURE PAINTED MISS BETSEY TROTWOOD SAID THE GENTLEMAN PRAY WALK IN I WAS ENGAGED FOR A MOMENT BUT YOULL EXCUSE MY BEING BUSY YOU KNOW MY MOTIVE I HAVE BUT ONE IN LIFE MISS BETSEY THANKED HIM AND WE WENT INTO HIS ROOM WHICH WAS FURNISHED AS AN OFFICE WITH BOOKS PAPERS TIN BOXES AND SO FORTH IT LOOKED INTO A GARDEN AND HAD AN IRON SAFE LET INTO THE WALL SO IMMEDIATELY OVER THE MANTELSHELF THAT I WONDERED AS I SAT DOWN HOW THE SWEEPS GOT ROUND IT WHEN THEY SWEPT THE CHIMNEY WELL MISS TROTWOOD SAID MR WICKFIELD FOR I SOON FOUND THAT IT WAS HE AND THAT HE WAS A LAWYER AND STEWARD OF THE ESTATES OF A RICH GENTLEMAN OF THE COUNTY WHAT WIND BLOWS YOU HERE NOT AN ILL WIND I HOPE NO REPLIED MY AUNT I HAVE NOT COME FOR ANY LAW THATS RIGHT MAAM SAID MR WICKFIELD YOU HAD BETTER COME FOR ANYTHING ELSE HIS HAIR WAS QUITE WHITE NOW THOUGH HIS EYEBROWS WERE STILL BLACK HE HAD A VERY AGREEABLE FACE AND I THOUGHT WAS HANDSOME THERE WAS A CERTAIN RICHNESS IN HIS COMPLEXION WHICH I HAD BEEN LONG ACCUSTOMED UNDER PEGGOTTYS TUITION TO CONNECT WITH PORT WINE AND I FANCIED IT WAS IN HIS VOICE TOO AND REFERRED HIS GROWING CORPULENCY TO THE SAME CAUSE HE WAS VERY CLEANLY DRESSED IN A BLUE COAT STRIPED WAISTCOAT AND NANKEEN TROUSERS AND HIS FINE FRILLED SHIRT AND CAMBRIC NECKCLOTH LOOKED UNUSUALLY SOFT AND WHITE REMINDING MY STROLLING FANCY I CALL TO MIND OF THE PLUMAGE ON THE BREAST OF A SWAN THIS IS MY NEPHEW SAID MY AUNT WASNT AWARE YOU HAD ONE MISS TROTWOOD SAID

WE HAVE SAID MR WICKFIELD CONSIDERING YOUR NEPHEW COULDNT BOARD JUST NOW BUT HE COULD BOARD SOMEWHERE ELSE I SUPPOSE SUGGESTED MY AUNT MR WICKFIELD THOUGHT I COULD AFTER A LITTLE DISCUSSION HE PROPOSED TO TAKE MY AUNT TO THE SCHOOL THAT SHE MIGHT SEE IT AND JUDGE FOR HERSELF ALSO TO TAKE HER WITH THE SAME OBJECT TO TWO OR THREE HOUSES WHERE HE THOUGHT I COULD BE BOARDED MY AUNT EMBRACING THE PROPOSAL WE WERE ALL THREE GOING OUT TOGETHER WHEN HE STOPPED AND SAID OUR LITTLE FRIEND HERE MIGHT HAVE SOME MOTIVE PERHAPS FOR OBJECTING TO THE ARRANGEMENTS I THINK WE HAD BETTER LEAVE HIM BEHIND MY AUNT SEEMED DISPOSED TO CONTEST THE POINT BUT TO FACILITATE MATTERS I SAID I WOULD GLADLY REMAIN BEHIND IF THEY PLEASED AND RETURNED INTO MR WICKFIELDS OFFICE WHERE I SAT DOWN AGAIN IN THE CHAIR I HAD FIRST OCCUPIED TO AWAIT THEIR RETURN IT SO HAPPENED THAT THIS CHAIR WAS OPPOSITE A NARROW PASSAGE WHICH ENDED IN THE LITTLE CIRCULAR ROOM WHERE I HAD SEEN URIAH HEEPS PALE FACE LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW URIAH HAVING TAKEN THE PONY TO A NEIGHBOURING STABLE WAS AT WORK AT A DESK IN THIS ROOM WHICH HAD A BRASS FRAME ON THE TOP TO HANG PAPER UPON AND ON WHICH THE WRITING HE WAS MAKING A COPY OF WAS THEN HANGING THOUGH HIS FACE WAS TOWARDS ME I THOUGHT FOR SOME TIME THE WRITING BEING BETWEEN US THAT HE COULD NOT SEE ME BUT LOOKING THAT WAY MORE ATTENTIVELY IT MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE TO OBSERVE THAT EVERY NOW AND THEN HIS SLEEPLESS EYES WOULD COME BELOW THE WRITING LIKE TWO RED SUNS AND STEALTHILY STARE AT ME FOR I DARE SAY A WHOLE MINUTE AT A TIME DURING WHICH HIS PEN WENT OR PRETENDED TO GO AS CLEVERLY AS EVER I MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO GET OUT OF THEIR WAYSUCH AS STANDING ON A CHAIR TO LOOK AT A MAP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM AND PORING OVER THE COLUMNS OF A KENTISH NEWSPAPERBUT THEY ALWAYS ATTRACTED ME BACK AGAIN AND WHENEVER I LOOKED TOWARDS THOSE TWO RED SUNS I WAS SURE TO FIND THEM EITHER JUST RISING OR JUST SETTING AT LENGTH MUCH TO MY RELIEF MY AUNT AND MR WICKFIELD CAME BACK AFTER A PRETTY LONG ABSENCE THEY WERE NOT SO SUCCESSFUL AS I COULD HAVE WISHED FOR THOUGH THE ADVANTAGES OF THE SCHOOL WERE UNDENIABLE MY AUNT HAD NOT APPROVED OF ANY OF THE BOARDINGHOUSES PROPOSED FOR ME ITS VERY UNFORTUNATE SAID MY AUNT I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO TROT IT DOES HAPPEN UNFORTUNATELY SAID MR WICKFIELD BUT ILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO MISS TROTWOOD WHATS THAT

EVIDENTLY LIKED THE OFFER THOUGH SHE WAS DELICATE OF ACCEPTING IT SO DID I COME MISS TROTWOOD SAID MR WICKFIELD THIS IS THE WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY ITS ONLY A TEMPORARY ARRANGEMENT YOU KNOW IF IT DONT ACT WELL OR DONT QUITE ACCORD WITH OUR MUTUAL CONVENIENCE HE CAN EASILY GO TO THE RIGHTABOUT THERE WILL BE TIME TO FIND SOME BETTER PLACE FOR HIM IN THE MEANWHILE YOU HAD BETTER DETERMINE TO LEAVE HIM HERE FOR THE PRESENT I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU SAID MY AUNT AND SO IS HE I SEE BUT COME I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN CRIED MR WICKFIELD YOU SHALL NOT BE OPPRESSED BY THE RECEIPT OF FAVOURS MISS TROTWOOD YOU MAY PAY FOR HIM IF YOU LIKE WE WONT BE HARD ABOUT TERMS BUT YOU SHALL PAY IF YOU WILL ON THAT UNDERSTANDING SAID MY AUNT THOUGH IT DOESNT LESSEN THE REAL OBLIGATION I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO LEAVE HIM THEN COME AND SEE MY LITTLE HOUSEKEEPER SAID MR WICKFIELD WE ACCORDINGLY WENT UP A WONDERFUL OLD STAIRCASE WITH A BALUSTRADE SO BROAD THAT WE MIGHT HAVE GONE UP THAT ALMOST AS EASILY AND INTO A SHADY OLD DRAWINGROOM LIGHTED BY SOME THREE OR FOUR OF THE QUAINT WINDOWS I HAD LOOKED UP AT FROM THE STREET WHICH HAD OLD OAK SEATS IN THEM THAT SEEMED TO HAVE COME OF THE SAME TREES AS THE SHINING OAK FLOOR AND THE GREAT BEAMS IN THE CEILING IT WAS A PRETTILY FURNISHED ROOM WITH A PIANO AND SOME LIVELY FURNITURE IN RED AND GREEN AND SOME FLOWERS IT SEEMED TO BE ALL OLD NOOKS AND CORNERS AND IN EVERY NOOK AND CORNER THERE WAS SOME QUEER LITTLE TABLE OR CUPBOARD OR BOOKCASE OR SEAT OR SOMETHING OR OTHER THAT MADE ME THINK THERE WAS NOT SUCH ANOTHER GOOD CORNER IN THE ROOM UNTIL I LOOKED AT THE NEXT ONE AND FOUND IT EQUAL TO IT IF NOT BETTER ON EVERYTHING THERE WAS THE SAME AIR OF RETIREMENT AND CLEANLINESS THAT MARKED THE HOUSE OUTSIDE MR WICKFIELD TAPPED AT A DOOR IN A CORNER OF THE PANELLED WALL AND A GIRL OF ABOUT MY OWN AGE CAME QUICKLY OUT AND KISSED HIM ON HER FACE I SAW IMMEDIATELY THE PLACID AND SWEET EXPRESSION OF THE LADY WHOSE PICTURE HAD LOOKED AT ME DOWNSTAIRS IT SEEMED TO MY IMAGINATION AS IF THE PORTRAIT HAD GROWN WOMANLY AND THE ORIGINAL REMAINED A CHILD ALTHOUGH HER FACE WAS QUITE BRIGHT AND HAPPY THERE WAS A TRANQUILLITY ABOUT IT AND ABOUT HERA QUIET GOOD CALM SPIRITTHAT I NEVER HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT I SHALL NEVER FORGET THIS WAS HIS LITTLE HOUSEKEEPER HIS DAUGHTER AGNES MR WICKFIELD SAID WHEN I HEARD HOW HE SAID IT AND SAW HOW HE HELD HER HAND I GUESSED WHAT THE ONE MOTIVE OF HIS LIFE WAS SHE HAD A LITTLE BASKETTRIFLE HANGING AT HER SIDE WITH KEYS IN IT AND SHE LOOKED AS STAID AND AS DISCREET A HOUSEKEEPER AS THE OLD HOUSE COULD HAVE SHE LISTENED TO HER FATHER AS HE TOLD HER ABOUT ME WITH A PLEASANT FACE AND WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED PROPOSED TO MY AUNT THAT WE SHOULD GO UPSTAIRS AND SEE MY ROOM WE ALL WENT TOGETHER SHE BEFORE US AND A GLORIOUS OLD ROOM IT WAS WITH MORE OAK BEAMS AND DIAMOND PANES AND THE BROAD BALUSTRADE GOING ALL THE WAY UP TO IT I CANNOT CALL TO MIND WHERE OR WHEN IN MY CHILDHOOD I HAD SEEN A STAINED GLASS WINDOW IN A CHURCH NOR DO I RECOLLECT ITS SUBJECT BUT I KNOW THAT WHEN I SAW HER TURN ROUND IN THE GRAVE LIGHT OF THE OLD STAIRCASE AND WAIT FOR US ABOVE I THOUGHT OF THAT WINDOW AND I ASSOCIATED SOMETHING OF ITS TRANQUIL BRIGHTNESS WITH AGNES WICKFIELD EVER AFTERWARDS MY AUNT WAS AS HAPPY AS I WAS IN THE ARRANGEMENT MADE FOR ME AND WE WENT DOWN TO THE DRAWINGROOM AGAIN WELL PLEASED AND GRATIFIED AS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF STAYING TO DINNER LEST SHE SHOULD BY ANY CHANCE FAIL TO ARRIVE AT HOME WITH THE GREY PONY BEFORE DARK AND AS I APPREHEND MR WICKFIELD KNEW HER TOO WELL TO ARGUE ANY POINT WITH HER SOME LUNCH WAS PROVIDED FOR HER THERE AND AGNES WENT BACK TO HER GOVERNESS AND MR WICKFIELD TO HIS OFFICE SO WE WERE LEFT TO TAKE LEAVE OF ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT ANY RESTRAINT SHE TOLD ME THAT EVERYTHING WOULD BE ARRANGED FOR ME BY MR WICKFIELD AND THAT I SHOULD WANT FOR NOTHING AND GAVE ME THE KINDEST WORDS AND THE BEST ADVICE TROT SAID MY AUNT IN CONCLUSION BE A CREDIT TO YOURSELF TO ME AND MR DICK AND HEAVEN BE WITH YOU I WAS GREATLY OVERCOME AND COULD ONLY THANK HER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SEND MY LOVE TO MR DICK NEVER SAID MY AUNT BE MEAN IN ANYTHING NEVER BE FALSE NEVER BE CRUEL AVOID THOSE THREE VICES TROT AND I CAN ALWAYS BE HOPEFUL OF YOU I PROMISED AS WELL AS I COULD THAT I WOULD NOT ABUSE HER KINDNESS OR FORGET HER ADMONITION THE PONYS AT THE DOOR SAID MY AUNT AND I AM OFF STAY HERE WITH THESE WORDS SHE EMBRACED ME HASTILY AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM SHUTTING THE DOOR AFTER HER AT FIRST I WAS STARTLED BY SO ABRUPT A DEPARTURE AND ALMOST FEARED I HAD DISPLEASED HER BUT WHEN I LOOKED INTO THE STREET AND SAW HOW DEJECTEDLY SHE GOT INTO THE CHAISE AND DROVE AWAY WITHOUT LOOKING UP I UNDERSTOOD HER BETTER AND DID NOT DO HER THAT INJUSTICE BY FIVE OCLOCK WHICH WAS MR WICKFIELDS DINNERHOUR I HAD MUSTERED UP MY SPIRITS AGAIN AND WAS READY FOR MY KNIFE AND FORK THE CLOTH WAS ONLY LAID FOR US TWO BUT AGNES WAS WAITING IN THE DRAWINGROOM BEFORE DINNER WENT DOWN WITH HER FATHER AND SAT OPPOSITE TO HIM AT TABLE I DOUBTED WHETHER HE COULD HAVE DINED WITHOUT HER WE DID NOT STAY THERE AFTER DINNER BUT CAME UPSTAIRS INTO THE DRAWINGROOM AGAIN IN ONE SNUG CORNER OF WHICH AGNES SET GLASSES FOR HER FATHER AND A DECANTER OF PORT WINE I THOUGHT HE WOULD HAVE MISSED ITS USUAL FLAVOUR IF IT HAD BEEN PUT THERE FOR HIM BY ANY OTHER HANDS THERE HE SAT TAKING HIS WINE AND TAKING A GOOD DEAL OF IT FOR TWO HOURS WHILE AGNES PLAYED ON THE PIANO WORKED AND TALKED TO HIM AND ME HE WAS FOR THE MOST PART GAY AND CHEERFUL WITH US BUT SOMETIMES HIS EYES RESTED ON HER AND HE FELL INTO A BROODING STATE AND WAS SILENT SHE ALWAYS OBSERVED THIS QUICKLY I THOUGHT AND ALWAYS ROUSED HIM WITH A QUESTION OR CARESS THEN HE CAME OUT OF HIS MEDITATION AND DRANK MORE WINE AGNES MADE THE TEA AND PRESIDED OVER IT AND THE TIME PASSED AWAY AFTER IT AS AFTER DINNER UNTIL SHE WENT TO BED WHEN HER FATHER TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS AND KISSED HER AND SHE BEING GONE ORDERED CANDLES IN HIS OFFICE THEN I WENT TO BED TOO BUT IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING I HAD RAMBLED DOWN TO THE DOOR AND A LITTLE WAY ALONG THE STREET THAT I MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER PEEP AT THE OLD HOUSES AND THE GREY CATHEDRAL AND MIGHT THINK OF MY COMING THROUGH THAT OLD CITY ON MY JOURNEY AND OF MY PASSING THE VERY HOUSE I LIVED IN WITHOUT KNOWING IT AS I CAME BACK I SAW URIAH HEEP SHUTTING UP THE OFFICE AND FEELING FRIENDLY TOWARDS EVERYBODY WENT IN AND SPOKE TO HIM AND AT PARTING GAVE HIM MY HAND BUT OH WHAT A CLAMMY HAND HIS WAS AS GHOSTLY TO THE TOUCH AS TO THE SIGHT I RUBBED MINE AFTERWARDS TO WARM IT AND TO RUB HIS OFF IT WAS SUCH AN UNCOMFORTABLE HAND THAT WHEN I WENT TO MY ROOM IT WAS STILL COLD AND WET UPON MY MEMORY LEANING OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SEEING ONE OF THE FACES ON THE BEAMENDS LOOKING AT ME SIDEWAYS I FANCIED IT WAS URIAH HEEP GOT UP THERE SOMEHOW AND SHUT HIM OUT IN A HURRY CHAPTER I AM A NEW BOY IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST I ENTERED ON SCHOOL LIFE AGAIN I WENT ACCOMPANIED BY MR WICKFIELD TO THE SCENE OF MY FUTURE STUDIESA GRAVE BUILDING IN A COURTYARD WITH A LEARNED AIR ABOUT IT THAT SEEMED VERY WELL SUITED TO THE STRAY ROOKS AND JACKDAWS WHO CAME DOWN FROM THE CATHEDRAL TOWERS TO WALK WITH A CLERKLY BEARING ON THE GRASSPLOTAND WAS INTRODUCED TO MY NEW MASTER DOCTOR STRONG DOCTOR STRONG LOOKED ALMOST AS RUSTY TO MY THINKING AS THE TALL IRON RAILS AND GATES OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AND ALMOST AS STIFF AND HEAVY AS THE GREAT STONE URNS THAT FLANKED THEM AND WERE SET UP ON THE TOP OF THE REDBRICK WALL AT REGULAR DISTANCES ALL ROUND THE COURT LIKE SUBLIMATED SKITTLES FOR TIME TO PLAY AT HE WAS IN HIS LIBRARY I MEAN DOCTOR STRONG WAS WITH HIS CLOTHES NOT PARTICULARLY WELL BRUSHED AND HIS HAIR NOT PARTICULARLY WELL COMBED HIS KNEESMALLS UNBRACED HIS LONG BLACK GAITERS UNBUTTONED AND HIS SHOES YAWNING LIKE TWO CAVERNS ON THE HEARTHRUG TURNING UPON ME A LUSTRELESS EYE THAT REMINDED ME OF A LONGFORGOTTEN BLIND OLD HORSE WHO ONCE USED TO CROP THE GRASS AND TUMBLE OVER THE GRAVES IN BLUNDERSTONE CHURCHYARD HE SAID HE WAS GLAD TO SEE ME AND THEN HE GAVE ME HIS HAND WHICH I DIDNT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH AS IT DID NOTHING FOR ITSELF BUT SITTING AT WORK NOT FAR FROM DOCTOR STRONG WAS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG LADYWHOM HE CALLED ANNIE AND WHO WAS HIS DAUGHTER I SUPPOSEDWHO GOT ME OUT OF MY DIFFICULTY BY KNEELING DOWN TO PUT DOCTOR STRONGS SHOES ON AND BUTTON HIS GAITERS WHICH SHE DID WITH GREAT CHEERFULNESS AND QUICKNESS WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED AND WE WERE GOING OUT TO THE SCHOOLROOM I WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO HEAR MR WICKFIELD IN BIDDING HER GOOD MORNING ADDRESS HER AS MRS STRONG AND I WAS WONDERING COULD SHE BE DOCTOR STRONGS SONS WIFE OR COULD SHE BE MRS DOCTOR STRONG WHEN DOCTOR STRONG HIMSELF UNCONSCIOUSLY ENLIGHTENED ME BY THE BY WICKFIELD HE SAID STOPPING IN A PASSAGE WITH HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER YOU HAVE NOT FOUND ANY SUITABLE PROVISION FOR MY WIFES COUSIN YET NO SAID MR WICKFIELD NO NOT YET I COULD WISH IT DONE AS SOON AS IT CAN BE DONE WICKFIELD SAID DOCTOR STRONG FOR JACK MALDON IS NEEDY AND IDLE AND OF THOSE TWO BAD THINGS WORSE THINGS SOMETIMES COME WHAT DOES DOCTOR WATTS SAY HE ADDED LOOKING AT ME AND MOVING HIS HEAD TO THE TIME OF HIS QUOTATION SATAN FINDS SOME MISCHIEF STILL FOR IDLE HANDS TO DO EGAD DOCTOR RETURNED MR WICKFIELD IF DOCTOR WATTS KNEW MANKIND HE MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN WITH AS MUCH TRUTH SATAN FINDS SOME MISCHIEF

BRING ME BACK TO THE QUESTION WITH AN APOLOGY FOR DIGRESSING NO I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DISPOSE OF MR JACK MALDON YET I BELIEVE HE SAID THIS WITH SOME HESITATION I PENETRATE YOUR MOTIVE AND IT MAKES THE THING MORE DIFFICULT MY MOTIVE RETURNED DOCTOR STRONG IS TO MAKE SOME SUITABLE PROVISION FOR A COUSIN AND AN OLD PLAYFELLOW OF ANNIES YES I KNOW SAID MR WICKFIELD AT HOME OR ABROAD AYE REPLIED THE

BELIEVE YOU AND OF COURSE I DO BELIEVE YOU SAID MR WICKFIELD IT MIGHT HAVE SIMPLIFIED MY OFFICE VERY MUCH IF I HAD KNOWN IT BEFORE BUT I CONFESS I ENTERTAINED ANOTHER IMPRESSION DOCTOR STRONG REGARDED HIM WITH A PUZZLED AND DOUBTING LOOK WHICH ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SUBSIDED INTO A SMILE THAT GAVE ME GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT FOR IT WAS FULL OF AMIABILITY AND SWEETNESS AND THERE WAS A SIMPLICITY IN IT AND INDEED IN HIS WHOLE MANNER WHEN THE STUDIOUS PONDERING FROST UPON IT WAS GOT THROUGH VERY ATTRACTIVE AND HOPEFUL TO A YOUNG SCHOLAR LIKE ME REPEATING NO AND NOT THE LEAST AND OTHER SHORT ASSURANCES TO THE SAME PURPORT DOCTOR STRONG JOGGED ON BEFORE US AT A QUEER UNEVEN PACE AND WE FOLLOWED MR WICKFIELD LOOKING GRAVE I OBSERVED AND SHAKING HIS HEAD TO HIMSELF WITHOUT KNOWING THAT I SAW HIM THE SCHOOLROOM WAS A PRETTY LARGE HALL ON THE QUIETEST SIDE OF THE HOUSE CONFRONTED BY THE STATELY STARE OF SOME HALFDOZEN OF THE GREAT URNS AND COMMANDING A PEEP OF AN OLD SECLUDED GARDEN BELONGING TO THE DOCTOR WHERE THE PEACHES WERE RIPENING ON THE SUNNY SOUTH WALL THERE WERE TWO GREAT ALOES IN TUBS ON THE TURF OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS THE BROAD HARD LEAVES OF WHICH PLANT LOOKING AS IF THEY WERE MADE OF PAINTED TIN HAVE EVER SINCE BY ASSOCIATION BEEN SYMBOLICAL TO ME OF SILENCE AND RETIREMENT ABOUT FIVEANDTWENTY BOYS WERE STUDIOUSLY ENGAGED AT THEIR BOOKS WHEN WE WENT IN BUT THEY ROSE TO GIVE THE DOCTOR GOOD MORNING AND REMAINED STANDING WHEN THEY SAW MR WICKFIELD AND ME A NEW BOY YOUNG GENTLEMEN SAID THE DOCTOR TROTWOOD COPPERFIELD ONE ADAMS WHO WAS THE HEADBOY THEN STEPPED OUT OF HIS PLACE AND WELCOMED ME HE LOOKED LIKE A YOUNG CLERGYMAN IN HIS WHITE CRAVAT BUT HE WAS VERY AFFABLE AND GOODHUMOURED AND HE SHOWED ME MY PLACE AND PRESENTED ME TO THE MASTERS IN A GENTLEMANLY WAY THAT WOULD HAVE PUT ME AT MY EASE IF ANYTHING COULD IT SEEMED TO ME SO LONG HOWEVER SINCE I HAD BEEN AMONG SUCH BOYS OR AMONG ANY COMPANIONS OF MY OWN AGE EXCEPT MICK WALKER AND MEALY POTATOES THAT I FELT AS STRANGE AS EVER I HAVE DONE IN MY LIFE I WAS SO CONSCIOUS OF HAVING PASSED THROUGH SCENES OF WHICH THEY COULD HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE AND OF HAVING ACQUIRED EXPERIENCES FOREIGN TO MY AGE APPEARANCE AND CONDITION AS ONE OF THEM THAT I HALF BELIEVED IT WAS AN IMPOSTURE TO COME THERE AS AN ORDINARY LITTLE SCHOOLBOY I HAD BECOME IN THE MURDSTONE AND GRINBY TIME HOWEVER SHORT OR LONG IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO UNUSED TO THE SPORTS AND GAMES OF BOYS THAT I KNEW I WAS AWKWARD AND INEXPERIENCED IN THE COMMONEST THINGS BELONGING TO THEM WHATEVER I HAD LEARNT HAD SO SLIPPED AWAY FROM ME IN THE SORDID CARES OF MY LIFE FROM DAY TO NIGHT THAT NOW WHEN I WAS EXAMINED ABOUT WHAT I KNEW I KNEW NOTHING AND WAS PUT INTO THE LOWEST FORM OF THE SCHOOL BUT TROUBLED AS I WAS BY MY WANT OF BOYISH SKILL AND OF BOOKLEARNING TOO I WAS MADE INFINITELY MORE UNCOMFORTABLE BY THE CONSIDERATION THAT IN WHAT I DID KNOW I WAS MUCH FARTHER REMOVED FROM MY COMPANIONS THAN IN WHAT I DID NOT MY MIND RAN UPON WHAT THEY WOULD THINK IF THEY KNEW OF MY FAMILIAR ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE KINGS BENCH PRISON WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT ME WHICH WOULD REVEAL MY PROCEEDINGS IN CONNEXION WITH THE MICAWBER FAMILYALL THOSE PAWNINGS AND SELLINGS AND SUPPERSIN SPITE OF MYSELF SUPPOSE SOME OF THE BOYS HAD SEEN ME COMING THROUGH CANTERBURY WAYWORN AND RAGGED AND SHOULD FIND ME OUT WHAT WOULD THEY SAY WHO MADE SO LIGHT OF MONEY IF THEY COULD KNOW HOW I HAD SCRAPED MY HALFPENCE TOGETHER FOR THE PURCHASE OF MY DAILY SAVELOY AND BEER OR MY SLICES OF PUDDING HOW WOULD IT AFFECT THEM WHO WERE SO INNOCENT OF LONDON LIFE AND LONDON STREETS TO DISCOVER HOW KNOWING I WAS AND WAS ASHAMED TO BE IN SOME OF THE MEANEST PHASES OF BOTH ALL THIS RAN IN MY HEAD SO MUCH ON THAT FIRST DAY AT DOCTOR STRONGS THAT I FELT DISTRUSTFUL OF MY SLIGHTEST LOOK AND GESTURE SHRUNK WITHIN MYSELF WHENSOEVER I WAS APPROACHED BY ONE OF MY NEW SCHOOLFELLOWS AND HURRIED OFF THE MINUTE SCHOOL WAS OVER AFRAID OF COMMITTING MYSELF IN MY RESPONSE TO ANY FRIENDLY NOTICE OR ADVANCE BUT THERE WAS SUCH AN INFLUENCE IN MR WICKFIELDS OLD HOUSE THAT WHEN I KNOCKED AT IT WITH MY NEW SCHOOLBOOKS UNDER MY ARM I BEGAN TO FEEL MY UNEASINESS SOFTENING AWAY AS I WENT UP TO MY AIRY OLD ROOM THE GRAVE SHADOW OF THE STAIRCASE SEEMED TO FALL UPON MY DOUBTS AND FEARS AND TO MAKE THE PAST MORE INDISTINCT I SAT THERE STURDILY CONNING MY BOOKS UNTIL DINNERTIME WE WERE OUT OF SCHOOL FOR GOOD AT THREE AND WENT DOWN HOPEFUL OF BECOMING A PASSABLE SORT OF BOY YET AGNES WAS IN THE DRAWINGROOM WAITING FOR HER FATHER WHO WAS DETAINED BY SOMEONE IN HIS OFFICE SHE MET ME WITH HER PLEASANT SMILE AND ASKED ME HOW I LIKED THE SCHOOL I TOLD HER I SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH I HOPED BUT I WAS A LITTLE STRANGE TO IT AT FIRST YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TO SCHOOL I SAID HAVE YOU OH YES EVERY DAY AH BUT YOU MEAN HERE AT YOUR OWN HOME PAPA COULDNT SPARE ME TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE SHE ANSWERED SMILING AND SHAKING HER HEAD HIS HOUSEKEEPER MUST BE IN HIS HOUSE YOU KNOW HE IS VERY FOND OF YOU I AM SURE I SAID SHE NODDED YES AND WENT TO THE DOOR TO LISTEN FOR HIS COMING UP THAT SHE MIGHT MEET HIM ON THE STAIRS BUT AS HE WAS NOT THERE SHE CAME BACK AGAIN MAMA HAS BEEN DEAD EVER SINCE I WAS BORN SHE SAID IN HER QUIET WAY I ONLY KNOW HER PICTURE DOWNSTAIRS I SAW YOU LOOKING AT IT YESTERDAY DID YOU THINK WHOSE IT WAS I TOLD HER YES BECAUSE IT WAS SO LIKE HERSELF PAPA SAYS SO TOO SAID AGNES PLEASED HARK THATS PAPA NOW HER BRIGHT CALM FACE LIGHTED UP WITH PLEASURE AS SHE WENT TO MEET HIM AND AS THEY CAME IN HAND IN HAND HE GREETED ME CORDIALLY AND TOLD ME I SHOULD CERTAINLY BE HAPPY UNDER DOCTOR STRONG WHO WAS ONE OF THE GENTLEST OF MEN THERE MAY BE SOME PERHAPSI DONT KNOW THAT THERE AREWHO ABUSE HIS KINDNESS SAID MR WICKFIELD NEVER BE ONE OF THOSE TROTWOOD IN ANYTHING HE IS THE LEAST SUSPICIOUS OF MANKIND AND WHETHER THATS A MERIT OR WHETHER ITS A BLEMISH IT DESERVES CONSIDERATION IN ALL DEALINGS WITH THE DOCTOR GREAT OR SMALL HE SPOKE I THOUGHT AS IF HE WERE WEARY OR DISSATISFIED WITH SOMETHING BUT I DID NOT PURSUE THE QUESTION IN MY MIND FOR DINNER WAS JUST THEN ANNOUNCED AND WE WENT DOWN AND TOOK THE SAME SEATS AS BEFORE WE HAD SCARCELY DONE SO WHEN URIAH HEEP PUT IN HIS RED HEAD AND HIS LANK HAND AT THE DOOR AND SAID HERES MR MALDON BEGS THE FAVOUR OF A WORD SIR I AM BUT THIS MOMENT QUIT OF MR MALDON SAID HIS MASTER YES SIR RETURNED URIAH BUT MR MALDON HAS COME BACK AND HE BEGS THE FAVOUR OF A WORD AS HE HELD THE DOOR OPEN WITH HIS HAND URIAH LOOKED AT ME AND LOOKED AT AGNES AND LOOKED AT THE DISHES AND LOOKED AT THE PLATES AND LOOKED AT EVERY OBJECT IN THE ROOM I

WAY I SUPPOSE ANNIE WOULD ONLY HAVE TO SAY TO THE OLD DOCTOR MEANING THAT MRS STRONG WOULD ONLY HAVE TO SAY TO HER HUSBANDDO I FOLLOW YOU SAID MR WICKFIELD QUITE SO RETURNED THE OTHER WOULD ONLY HAVE TO SAY THAT SHE WANTED SUCH AND SUCH A THING TO BE SO AND SO AND IT WOULD BE SO AND SO AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND WHY AS A MATTER OF COURSE MR MALDON ASKED MR WICKFIELD SEDATELY EATING HIS DINNER WHY

SOME COMPENSATION IS FAIR AND REASONABLE IN THAT SORT OF MARRIAGE COMPENSATION TO THE LADY SIR ASKED MR WICKFIELD GRAVELY TO THE LADY SIR MR JACK MALDON ANSWERED LAUGHING BUT APPEARING TO REMARK THAT MR WICKFIELD WENT ON WITH HIS DINNER IN THE SAME SEDATE IMMOVABLE MANNER AND THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE OF MAKING HIM RELAX A MUSCLE OF HIS FACE HE ADDED HOWEVER I HAVE SAID WHAT I CAME TO SAY AND WITH ANOTHER APOLOGY FOR THIS INTRUSION I MAY TAKE MYSELF OFF OF COURSE I SHALL OBSERVE YOUR DIRECTIONS IN CONSIDERING THE MATTER AS ONE TO BE ARRANGED BETWEEN YOU AND ME SOLELY AND NOT TO BE REFERRED TO UP AT THE DOCTORS HAVE YOU DINED ASKED MR WICKFIELD WITH A MOTION OF HIS HAND TOWARDS THE TABLE THANKEE I AM GOING TO DINE SAID MR MALDON WITH MY COUSIN ANNIE GOODBYE MR WICKFIELD WITHOUT RISING LOOKED AFTER HIM THOUGHTFULLY AS HE WENT OUT HE WAS RATHER A SHALLOW SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN I THOUGHT WITH A HANDSOME FACE A RAPID UTTERANCE AND A CONFIDENT BOLD AIR AND THIS WAS THE FIRST I EVER SAW OF MR JACK MALDON WHOM I HAD NOT EXPECTED TO SEE SO SOON WHEN I HEARD THE DOCTOR SPEAK OF HIM THAT MORNING WHEN WE HAD DINED WE WENT UPSTAIRS AGAIN WHERE EVERYTHING WENT ON EXACTLY AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AGNES SET THE GLASSES AND DECANTERS IN THE SAME CORNER AND MR WICKFIELD SAT DOWN TO DRINK AND DRANK A GOOD DEAL AGNES PLAYED THE PIANO TO HIM SAT BY HIM AND WORKED AND TALKED AND PLAYED SOME GAMES AT DOMINOES WITH ME IN GOOD TIME SHE MADE TEA AND AFTERWARDS WHEN I BROUGHT DOWN MY BOOKS LOOKED INTO THEM AND SHOWED ME WHAT SHE KNEW OF THEM WHICH WAS NO SLIGHT MATTER THOUGH SHE SAID IT WAS AND WHAT WAS THE BEST WAY TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND THEM I SEE HER WITH HER MODEST ORDERLY PLACID MANNER AND I HEAR HER BEAUTIFUL CALM VOICE AS I WRITE THESE WORDS THE INFLUENCE FOR ALL GOOD WHICH SHE CAME TO EXERCISE OVER ME AT A LATER TIME BEGINS ALREADY TO DESCEND UPON MY BREAST I LOVE LITTLE EMLY AND I DONT LOVE AGNESNO NOT AT ALL IN THAT WAYBUT I FEEL THAT THERE ARE GOODNESS PEACE AND TRUTH WHEREVER AGNES IS AND THAT THE SOFT LIGHT OF THE COLOURED WINDOW IN THE CHURCH SEEN LONG AGO FALLS ON HER ALWAYS AND ON ME WHEN I AM NEAR HER AND ON EVERYTHING AROUND THE TIME HAVING COME FOR HER WITHDRAWAL FOR THE NIGHT AND SHE HAVING LEFT US I GAVE MR WICKFIELD MY HAND PREPARATORY TO GOING AWAY MYSELF BUT HE CHECKED ME AND SAID SHOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY WITH US TROTWOOD OR TO GO ELSEWHERE TO STAY I ANSWERED QUICKLY YOU ARE SURE IF YOU PLEASE IF I MAY WHY ITS BUT A DULL LIFE THAT WE LEAD HERE BOY I AM AFRAID HE SAID NOT MORE DULL FOR ME THAN AGNES SIR NOT DULL AT ALL THAN AGNES HE REPEATED WALKING SLOWLY TO THE GREAT CHIMNEYPIECE AND LEANING AGAINST IT THAN AGNES HE HAD DRANK WINE THAT EVENING OR I FANCIED IT UNTIL HIS EYES WERE BLOODSHOT NOT THAT I COULD SEE THEM NOW FOR THEY WERE CAST DOWN AND SHADED BY HIS HAND BUT I HAD NOTICED THEM A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE NOW I WONDER HE MUTTERED WHETHER MY AGNES TIRES OF ME WHEN SHOULD I EVER TIRE OF HER BUT THATS DIFFERENT THATS QUITE DIFFERENT HE WAS MUSING NOT SPEAKING TO ME SO I REMAINED QUIET A DULL OLD HOUSE HE SAID AND A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT I MUST HAVE HER NEAR ME I MUST KEEP HER NEAR ME IF THE THOUGHT THAT I MAY DIE AND LEAVE MY DARLING OR THAT MY DARLING MAY DIE AND LEAVE ME COMES LIKE A SPECTRE TO DISTRESS MY HAPPIEST HOURS AND IS ONLY TO BE DROWNED IN HE DID NOT SUPPLY THE WORD BUT PACING SLOWLY TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SAT AND MECHANICALLY GOING THROUGH THE ACTION OF POURING WINE FROM THE EMPTY DECANTER SET IT DOWN AND PACED BACK AGAIN IF IT IS MISERABLE TO BEAR WHEN SHE IS HERE HE SAID WHAT WOULD IT BE AND SHE AWAY NO NO NO I CANNOT TRY THAT HE LEANED AGAINST THE CHIMNEYPIECE BROODING SO LONG THAT I COULD NOT DECIDE WHETHER TO RUN THE RISK OF DISTURBING HIM BY GOING OR TO REMAIN QUIETLY WHERE I WAS UNTIL HE SHOULD COME OUT OF HIS REVERIE AT LENGTH HE AROUSED HIMSELF AND LOOKED ABOUT THE ROOM UNTIL HIS EYES ENCOUNTERED MINE STAY WITH US TROTWOOD EH HE SAID IN HIS USUAL MANNER AND AS IF HE WERE ANSWERING SOMETHING I HAD JUST SAID I AM GLAD OF IT YOU ARE COMPANY TO US BOTH IT IS WHOLESOME TO HAVE YOU HERE WHOLESOME FOR ME WHOLESOME FOR AGNES WHOLESOME PERHAPS FOR ALL OF US I AM SURE IT IS FOR ME SIR I SAID I AM SO GLAD TO BE HERE THATS A FINE FELLOW SAID MR WICKFIELD AS LONG AS YOU ARE GLAD TO BE HERE YOU SHALL STAY HERE HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME UPON IT AND CLAPPED ME ON THE BACK AND TOLD ME THAT WHEN I HAD ANYTHING TO DO AT NIGHT AFTER AGNES HAD LEFT US OR WHEN I WISHED TO READ FOR MY OWN PLEASURE I WAS FREE TO COME DOWN TO HIS ROOM IF HE WERE THERE AND IF I DESIRED IT FOR COMPANYS SAKE AND TO SIT WITH HIM I THANKED HIM FOR HIS CONSIDERATION AND AS HE WENT DOWN SOON AFTERWARDS AND I WAS NOT TIRED WENT DOWN TOO WITH A BOOK IN MY HAND TO AVAIL MYSELF FOR HALFANHOUR OF HIS PERMISSION BUT SEEING A LIGHT IN THE LITTLE ROUND OFFICE AND IMMEDIATELY FEELING MYSELF ATTRACTED TOWARDS URIAH HEEP WHO HAD A SORT OF FASCINATION FOR ME I WENT IN THERE INSTEAD I FOUND URIAH READING A GREAT FAT BOOK WITH SUCH DEMONSTRATIVE ATTENTION THAT HIS LANK FOREFINGER FOLLOWED UP EVERY LINE AS HE READ AND MADE CLAMMY TRACKS ALONG THE PAGE OR SO I FULLY BELIEVED LIKE A SNAIL YOU ARE WORKING LATE TONIGHT URIAH SAYS I YES MASTER COPPERFIELD SAYS URIAH AS I WAS GETTING ON THE STOOL OPPOSITE TO TALK TO HIM MORE CONVENIENTLY I OBSERVED THAT HE HAD NOT SUCH A THING AS A SMILE ABOUT HIM AND THAT HE COULD ONLY WIDEN HIS MOUTH AND MAKE TWO HARD CREASES DOWN HIS CHEEKS ONE ON EACH SIDE TO STAND FOR ONE I AM NOT DOING OFFICEWORK MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID URIAH WHAT WORK THEN I ASKED I AM IMPROVING MY LEGAL KNOWLEDGE MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID URIAH I AM GOING THROUGH TIDDS PRACTICE OH WHAT A WRITER MR TIDD IS MASTER COPPERFIELD MY STOOL WAS SUCH A TOWER OF OBSERVATION THAT AS I WATCHED HIM READING ON AGAIN AFTER THIS RAPTUROUS EXCLAMATION AND FOLLOWING UP THE LINES WITH HIS FOREFINGER I OBSERVED THAT HIS NOSTRILS WHICH WERE THIN AND POINTED WITH SHARP DINTS IN THEM HAD A SINGULAR AND MOST UNCOMFORTABLE WAY OF EXPANDING AND CONTRACTING THEMSELVESTHAT THEY SEEMED TO TWINKLE INSTEAD OF HIS EYES WHICH HARDLY EVER TWINKLED AT ALL I SUPPOSE YOU ARE QUITE A GREAT LAWYER I SAID AFTER LOOKING AT HIM FOR SOME TIME ME MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID URIAH OH NO IM A VERY UMBLE PERSON IT WAS NO FANCY OF MINE ABOUT HIS HANDS I OBSERVED FOR HE FREQUENTLY GROUND THE PALMS AGAINST EACH OTHER AS IF TO SQUEEZE THEM DRY

TIME MASTER COPPERFIELD I SAID I WAS GOING TO BE BROUGHT UP THERE I BELIEVED AS LONG AS I REMAINED AT SCHOOL OH INDEED EXCLAIMED URIAH I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD COME INTO THE BUSINESS AT LAST MASTER

COPPERFIELD I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD INDEED AND OH INDEED MASTER COPPERFIELD I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD CERTAINLY OVER AND OVER AGAIN BEING AT LAST READY TO LEAVE THE OFFICE FOR THE NIGHT HE ASKED ME IF IT WOULD SUIT MY CONVENIENCE TO HAVE THE LIGHT PUT OUT AND ON MY ANSWERING YES INSTANTLY EXTINGUISHED IT AFTER SHAKING HANDS WITH MEHIS HAND FELT LIKE A FISH IN THE DARKHE OPENED THE DOOR INTO THE STREET A VERY LITTLE AND CREPT OUT AND SHUT IT LEAVING ME TO GROPE MY WAY BACK INTO THE HOUSE WHICH COST ME SOME TROUBLE AND A FALL OVER HIS STOOL THIS WAS THE PROXIMATE CAUSE I SUPPOSE OF MY DREAMING ABOUT HIM FOR WHAT APPEARED TO ME TO BE HALF THE NIGHT AND DREAMING AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT HE HAD LAUNCHED MR PEGGOTTYS HOUSE ON A PIRATICAL EXPEDITION WITH A BLACK FLAG AT THE MASTHEAD BEARING THE INSCRIPTION TIDDS PRACTICE UNDER WHICH DIABOLICAL ENSIGN HE WAS CARRYING ME AND LITTLE EMLY TO THE SPANISH MAIN TO BE DROWNED I GOT A LITTLE THE BETTER OF MY UNEASINESS WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL NEXT DAY AND A GOOD DEAL THE BETTER NEXT DAY AND SO SHOOK IT OFF BY DEGREES THAT IN LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT I WAS QUITE AT HOME AND HAPPY AMONG MY NEW COMPANIONS I WAS AWKWARD ENOUGH IN THEIR GAMES AND BACKWARD ENOUGH IN THEIR STUDIES BUT CUSTOM WOULD IMPROVE ME IN THE FIRST RESPECT I HOPED AND HARD WORK IN THE SECOND ACCORDINGLY I WENT TO WORK VERY HARD BOTH IN PLAY AND IN EARNEST AND GAINED GREAT COMMENDATION AND IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE THE MURDSTONE AND GRINBY LIFE BECAME SO STRANGE TO ME THAT I HARDLY BELIEVED IN IT WHILE MY PRESENT LIFE GREW SO FAMILIAR THAT I SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN LEADING IT A LONG TIME DOCTOR STRONGS WAS AN EXCELLENT SCHOOL AS DIFFERENT FROM MR CREAKLES AS GOOD IS FROM EVIL IT WAS VERY GRAVELY AND DECOROUSLY ORDERED AND ON A SOUND SYSTEM WITH AN APPEAL IN EVERYTHING TO THE HONOUR AND GOOD FAITH OF THE BOYS AND AN AVOWED INTENTION TO RELY ON THEIR POSSESSION OF THOSE QUALITIES UNLESS THEY PROVED THEMSELVES UNWORTHY OF IT WHICH WORKED WONDERS WE ALL FELT THAT WE HAD A PART IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PLACE AND IN SUSTAINING ITS CHARACTER AND DIGNITY HENCE WE SOON BECAME WARMLY ATTACHED TO ITI AM SURE I DID FOR ONE AND I NEVER KNEW IN ALL MY TIME OF ANY OTHER BOY BEING OTHERWISEAND LEARNT WITH A GOOD WILL DESIRING TO DO IT CREDIT WE HAD NOBLE GAMES OUT OF HOURS AND PLENTY OF LIBERTY BUT EVEN THEN AS I REMEMBER WE WERE WELL SPOKEN OF IN THE TOWN AND RARELY DID ANY DISGRACE BY OUR APPEARANCE OR MANNER TO THE REPUTATION OF DOCTOR STRONG AND DOCTOR STRONGS BOYS SOME OF THE HIGHER SCHOLARS BOARDED IN THE DOCTORS HOUSE AND THROUGH THEM I LEARNED AT SECOND HAND SOME PARTICULARS OF THE DOCTORS HISTORYAS HOW HE HAD NOT YET BEEN MARRIED TWELVE MONTHS TO THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY I HAD SEEN IN THE STUDY WHOM HE HAD MARRIED FOR LOVE FOR SHE HAD NOT A SIXPENCE AND HAD A WORLD OF POOR RELATIONS SO OUR FELLOWS SAID READY TO SWARM THE DOCTOR OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME ALSO HOW THE DOCTORS COGITATING MANNER WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIS BEING ALWAYS ENGAGED IN LOOKING OUT FOR GREEK ROOTS WHICH IN MY INNOCENCE AND IGNORANCE I SUPPOSED TO BE A BOTANICAL FUROR ON THE DOCTORS PART ESPECIALLY AS HE ALWAYS LOOKED AT THE GROUND WHEN HE WALKED ABOUT UNTIL I UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY WERE ROOTS OF WORDS WITH A VIEW TO A NEW DICTIONARY WHICH HE HAD IN CONTEMPLATION ADAMS OUR HEADBOY WHO HAD A TURN FOR MATHEMATICS HAD MADE A CALCULATION I WAS INFORMED OF THE TIME THIS DICTIONARY WOULD TAKE IN COMPLETING ON THE DOCTORS PLAN AND AT THE DOCTORS RATE OF GOING HE CONSIDERED THAT IT MIGHT BE DONE IN ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTYNINE YEARS COUNTING FROM THE DOCTORS LAST OR SIXTYSECOND BIRTHDAY BUT THE DOCTOR HIMSELF WAS THE IDOL OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN A BADLY COMPOSED SCHOOL IF HE HAD BEEN ANYTHING ELSE FOR HE WAS THE KINDEST OF MEN WITH A SIMPLE FAITH IN HIM THAT MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED THE STONE HEARTS OF THE VERY URNS UPON THE WALL AS HE WALKED UP AND DOWN THAT PART OF THE COURTYARD WHICH WAS AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WITH THE STRAY ROOKS AND JACKDAWS LOOKING AFTER HIM WITH THEIR HEADS COCKED SLYLY AS IF THEY KNEW HOW MUCH MORE KNOWING THEY WERE IN WORLDLY AFFAIRS THAN HE IF ANY SORT OF VAGABOND COULD ONLY GET NEAR ENOUGH TO HIS CREAKING SHOES TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION TO ONE SENTENCE OF A TALE OF DISTRESS THAT VAGABOND WAS MADE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS IT WAS SO NOTORIOUS IN THE HOUSE THAT THE MASTERS AND HEADBOYS TOOK PAINS TO CUT THESE MARAUDERS OFF AT ANGLES AND TO GET OUT OF WINDOWS AND TURN THEM OUT OF THE COURTYARD BEFORE THEY COULD MAKE THE DOCTOR AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE WHICH WAS SOMETIMES HAPPILY EFFECTED WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF HIM WITHOUT HIS KNOWING ANYTHING OF THE MATTER AS HE JOGGED TO AND FRO OUTSIDE HIS OWN DOMAIN AND UNPROTECTED HE WAS A VERY SHEEP FOR THE SHEARERS HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIS GAITERS OFF HIS LEGS TO GIVE AWAY IN FACT THERE WAS A STORY CURRENT AMONG US I HAVE NO IDEA AND NEVER HAD ON WHAT AUTHORITY BUT I HAVE BELIEVED IT FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT I FEEL QUITE CERTAIN IT IS TRUE THAT ON A FROSTY DAY ONE WINTERTIME HE ACTUALLY DID BESTOW HIS GAITERS ON A BEGGARWOMAN WHO OCCASIONED SOME SCANDAL IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BY EXHIBITING A FINE INFANT FROM DOOR TO DOOR WRAPPED IN THOSE GARMENTS WHICH WERE UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED BEING AS WELL KNOWN IN THE VICINITY AS THE CATHEDRAL THE LEGEND ADDED THAT THE ONLY PERSON WHO DID NOT IDENTIFY THEM WAS THE DOCTOR HIMSELF WHO WHEN THEY WERE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS DISPLAYED AT THE DOOR OF A LITTLE SECONDHAND SHOP OF NO VERY GOOD REPUTE WHERE SUCH THINGS WERE TAKEN IN EXCHANGE FOR GIN WAS MORE THAN ONCE OBSERVED TO HANDLE THEM APPROVINGLY AS IF ADMIRING SOME CURIOUS NOVELTY IN THE PATTERN AND CONSIDERING THEM AN IMPROVEMENT ON HIS OWN IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TO SEE THE DOCTOR WITH HIS PRETTY YOUNG WIFE HE HAD A FATHERLY BENIGNANT WAY OF SHOWING HIS FONDNESS FOR HER WHICH SEEMED IN ITSELF TO EXPRESS A GOOD MAN I OFTEN SAW THEM WALKING IN THE GARDEN WHERE THE PEACHES WERE AND I SOMETIMES HAD A NEARER OBSERVATION OF THEM IN THE STUDY OR THE PARLOUR SHE APPEARED TO ME TO TAKE GREAT CARE OF THE DOCTOR AND TO LIKE HIM VERY MUCH THOUGH I NEVER THOUGHT HER VITALLY INTERESTED IN THE DICTIONARY SOME CUMBROUS FRAGMENTS OF WHICH WORK THE DOCTOR ALWAYS CARRIED IN HIS POCKETS AND IN THE LINING OF HIS HAT AND GENERALLY SEEMED TO BE EXPOUNDING TO HER AS THEY WALKED ABOUT I SAW A GOOD DEAL OF MRS STRONG BOTH BECAUSE SHE HAD TAKEN A LIKING FOR ME ON THE MORNING OF MY INTRODUCTION TO THE DOCTOR AND WAS ALWAYS AFTERWARDS KIND TO ME AND INTERESTED IN ME AND BECAUSE SHE WAS VERY FOND OF AGNES AND WAS OFTEN BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AT OUR HOUSE THERE WAS A CURIOUS CONSTRAINT BETWEEN HER AND MR WICKFIELD I THOUGHT OF WHOM SHE SEEMED TO BE AFRAID THAT NEVER WORE OFF WHEN SHE CAME THERE OF AN EVENING SHE ALWAYS SHRUNK FROM ACCEPTING HIS ESCORT HOME AND RAN AWAY WITH ME INSTEAD AND SOMETIMES AS WE WERE RUNNING GAILY ACROSS THE CATHEDRAL YARD TOGETHER EXPECTING TO MEET NOBODY WE WOULD MEET MR JACK MALDON WHO WAS ALWAYS SURPRISED TO SEE US MRS STRONGS MAMA WAS A LADY I TOOK GREAT DELIGHT IN HER NAME WAS MRS MARKLEHAM BUT OUR BOYS USED TO CALL HER THE OLD SOLDIER ON ACCOUNT OF HER GENERALSHIP AND THE SKILL WITH WHICH SHE MARSHALLED GREAT FORCES OF RELATIONS AGAINST THE DOCTOR SHE WAS A LITTLE SHARPEYED WOMAN WHO USED TO WEAR WHEN SHE WAS DRESSED ONE UNCHANGEABLE CAP ORNAMENTED WITH SOME ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS AND TWO ARTIFICIAL BUTTERFLIES SUPPOSED TO BE HOVERING ABOVE THE FLOWERS THERE WAS A SUPERSTITION AMONG US THAT THIS CAP HAD COME FROM FRANCE AND COULD ONLY ORIGINATE IN THE WORKMANSHIP OF THAT INGENIOUS NATION BUT ALL I CERTAINLY KNOW ABOUT IT IS THAT IT ALWAYS MADE ITS APPEARANCE OF AN EVENING WHERESOEVER MRS MARKLEHAM MADE HER APPEARANCE THAT IT WAS CARRIED ABOUT TO FRIENDLY MEETINGS IN A HINDOO BASKET THAT THE BUTTERFLIES HAD THE GIFT OF TREMBLING CONSTANTLY AND THAT THEY IMPROVED THE SHINING HOURS AT DOCTOR STRONGS EXPENSE LIKE BUSY BEES I OBSERVED THE OLD SOLDIERNOT TO ADOPT THE NAME DISRESPECTFULLYTO PRETTY GOOD ADVANTAGE ON A NIGHT WHICH IS MADE MEMORABLE TO ME BY SOMETHING ELSE I SHALL RELATE IT WAS THE NIGHT OF A LITTLE PARTY AT THE DOCTORS WHICH WAS GIVEN ON THE OCCASION OF MR JACK MALDONS DEPARTURE FOR INDIA WHITHER HE WAS GOING AS A CADET OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND MR WICKFIELD HAVING AT LENGTH ARRANGED THE BUSINESS IT HAPPENED TO BE THE DOCTORS BIRTHDAY TOO WE HAD HAD A HOLIDAY HAD MADE PRESENTS TO HIM IN THE MORNING HAD MADE A SPEECH TO HIM THROUGH THE HEADBOY AND HAD CHEERED HIM UNTIL WE WERE HOARSE AND UNTIL HE HAD SHED TEARS AND NOW IN THE EVENING MR WICKFIELD AGNES AND I WENT TO HAVE TEA WITH HIM IN HIS PRIVATE CAPACITY MR JACK MALDON WAS THERE BEFORE US MRS STRONG DRESSED IN WHITE WITH CHERRYCOLOURED RIBBONS WAS PLAYING THE PIANO WHEN WE WENT IN AND HE WAS LEANING OVER HER TO TURN THE LEAVES THE CLEAR RED AND WHITE OF HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT SO BLOOMING AND FLOWERLIKE AS USUAL I THOUGHT WHEN SHE TURNED ROUND BUT SHE LOOKED VERY PRETTY WONDERFULLY PRETTY I HAVE FORGOTTEN DOCTOR SAID MRS STRONGS MAMA WHEN WE WERE SEATED TO PAY YOU THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE DAYTHOUGH THEY ARE AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE VERY FAR FROM BEING MERE COMPLIMENTS IN MY CASE ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU MANY HAPPY

BE KINDER YET I VENTURE TO PREDICT IF YOU DESERVE IT I HAVE NO FALSE PRIDE I NEVER HESITATE TO ADMIT FRANKLY THAT THERE ARE SOME MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY WHO WANT A FRIEND YOU WERE ONE YOURSELF BEFORE YOUR COUSINS INFLUENCE RAISED UP ONE FOR YOU THE DOCTOR IN THE GOODNESS OF HIS HEART WAVED HIS HAND AS IF TO MAKE LIGHT OF IT AND SAVE MR JACK MALDON FROM ANY FURTHER REMINDER BUT MRS MARKLEHAM CHANGED HER CHAIR FOR ONE NEXT THE DOCTORS AND PUTTING HER FAN ON HIS COATSLEEVE SAID NO REALLY MY DEAR DOCTOR YOU MUST EXCUSE ME IF I APPEAR TO DWELL ON THIS RATHER BECAUSE I FEEL SO VERY STRONGLY I CALL IT QUITE MY MONOMANIA IT IS SUCH A SUBJECT OF MINE YOU ARE A BLESSING TO US YOU REALLY ARE A BOON YOU KNOW NONSENSE NONSENSE SAID THE DOCTOR NO NO I BEG YOUR PARDON RETORTED THE OLD SOLDIER WITH

PERFECTLY HONEST AND OUTSPOKEN WHAT I AM SAYING IS WHAT I SAID WHEN YOU FIRST OVERPOWERED ME WITH SURPRISEYOU REMEMBER HOW SURPRISED I WASBY PROPOSING FOR ANNIE NOT THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING SO VERY MUCH OUT OF THE WAY IN THE MERE FACT OF THE PROPOSALIT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS TO SAY THATBUT BECAUSE YOU HAVING KNOWN HER POOR FATHER AND HAVING KNOWN HER FROM A BABY SIX MONTHS OLD I HADNT THOUGHT OF

WILL REPRESENT THE WISDOM AND STATION AND I MAY SAY THE MEANS OF OUR FAMILY AND WILL BE IN SHORT A BOON TO IT I USED THE WORD AT THE TIME AND I HAVE USED IT AGAIN TODAY IF I HAVE ANY MERIT IT IS CONSISTENCY THE DAUGHTER HAD SAT QUITE SILENT AND STILL DURING THIS SPEECH WITH HER EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND HER COUSIN STANDING NEAR HER AND LOOKING ON THE GROUND TOO SHE NOW SAID VERY SOFTLY IN A TREMBLING VOICE MAMA I HOPE YOU HAVE FINISHED NO MY DEAR ANNIE RETURNED THE OLD SOLDIER I HAVE NOT QUITE FINISHED SINCE YOU ASK ME MY LOVE I REPLY THAT I HAVE NOT I COMPLAIN THAT YOU REALLY ARE A LITTLE UNNATURAL TOWARDS YOUR OWN FAMILY AND AS IT IS OF NO USE COMPLAINING TO YOU I MEAN TO COMPLAIN TO YOUR HUSBAND NOW MY DEAR DOCTOR DO LOOK AT THAT SILLY WIFE OF YOURS AS THE DOCTOR TURNED HIS KIND FACE WITH ITS SMILE OF SIMPLICITY AND GENTLENESS TOWARDS HER SHE DROOPED HER HEAD MORE I NOTICED THAT MR WICKFIELD LOOKED AT HER STEADILY WHEN I HAPPENED TO SAY TO THAT NAUGHTY THING THE OTHER DAY PURSUED HER MOTHER SHAKING HER HEAD AND HER FAN AT HER PLAYFULLY THAT THERE WAS A FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCE SHE MIGHT MENTION TO YOUINDEED I THINK WAS BOUND TO MENTIONSHE SAID THAT TO MENTION IT WAS TO

RETURNED THE DOCTOR SHALL I CERTAINLY WELL THEN I WILL SAID THE OLD SOLDIER THATS A BARGAIN AND HAVING I SUPPOSE CARRIED HER POINT SHE TAPPED THE DOCTORS HAND SEVERAL TIMES WITH HER FAN WHICH SHE KISSED FIRST AND RETURNED TRIUMPHANTLY TO HER FORMER STATION SOME MORE COMPANY COMING IN AMONG WHOM WERE THE TWO MASTERS AND ADAMS THE TALK BECAME GENERAL AND IT NATURALLY TURNED ON MR JACK MALDON AND HIS VOYAGE AND THE COUNTRY HE WAS GOING TO AND HIS VARIOUS PLANS AND PROSPECTS HE WAS TO LEAVE THAT NIGHT AFTER SUPPER IN A POSTCHAISE FOR GRAVESEND WHERE THE SHIP IN WHICH HE WAS TO MAKE THE VOYAGE LAY AND WAS TO BE GONEUNLESS HE CAME HOME ON LEAVE OR FOR HIS HEALTHI DONT KNOW HOW MANY YEARS I RECOLLECT IT WAS SETTLED BY GENERAL CONSENT THAT INDIA WAS QUITE A MISREPRESENTED COUNTRY AND HAD NOTHING OBJECTIONABLE IN IT BUT A TIGER OR TWO AND A LITTLE HEAT IN THE WARM PART OF THE DAY FOR MY OWN PART I LOOKED ON MR JACK MALDON AS A MODERN SINDBAD AND PICTURED HIM THE BOSOM FRIEND OF ALL THE RAJAHS IN THE EAST SITTING UNDER CANOPIES SMOKING CURLY GOLDEN PIPESA MILE LONG IF THEY COULD BE STRAIGHTENED OUT MRS STRONG WAS A VERY PRETTY SINGER AS I KNEW WHO OFTEN HEARD HER SINGING BY HERSELF BUT WHETHER SHE WAS AFRAID OF SINGING BEFORE PEOPLE OR WAS OUT OF VOICE THAT EVENING IT WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE COULDNT SING AT ALL SHE TRIED A DUET ONCE WITH HER COUSIN MALDON BUT COULD NOT SO MUCH AS BEGIN AND AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE TRIED TO SING BY HERSELF ALTHOUGH SHE BEGAN SWEETLY HER VOICE DIED AWAY ON A SUDDEN AND LEFT HER QUITE DISTRESSED WITH HER HEAD HANGING DOWN OVER THE KEYS THE GOOD DOCTOR SAID SHE WAS NERVOUS AND TO RELIEVE HER PROPOSED A ROUND GAME AT CARDS OF WHICH HE KNEW AS MUCH AS OF THE ART OF PLAYING THE TROMBONE BUT I REMARKED THAT THE OLD SOLDIER TOOK HIM INTO CUSTODY DIRECTLY FOR HER PARTNER AND INSTRUCTED HIM AS THE FIRST PRELIMINARY OF INITIATION TO GIVE HER ALL THE SILVER HE HAD IN HIS POCKET WE HAD A MERRY GAME NOT MADE THE LESS MERRY BY THE DOCTORS MISTAKES OF WHICH HE COMMITTED AN INNUMERABLE QUANTITY IN SPITE OF THE WATCHFULNESS OF THE BUTTERFLIES AND TO THEIR GREAT AGGRAVATION MRS STRONG HAD DECLINED TO PLAY ON THE GROUND OF NOT FEELING VERY WELL AND HER COUSIN MALDON HAD EXCUSED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD SOME PACKING TO DO WHEN HE HAD DONE IT HOWEVER HE RETURNED AND THEY SAT TOGETHER TALKING ON THE SOFA FROM TIME TO TIME SHE CAME AND LOOKED OVER THE DOCTORS HAND AND TOLD HIM WHAT TO PLAY SHE WAS VERY PALE AS SHE BENT OVER HIM AND I THOUGHT HER FINGER TREMBLED AS SHE POINTED OUT THE CARDS BUT THE DOCTOR WAS QUITE HAPPY IN HER ATTENTION AND TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS IF IT WERE SO AT SUPPER WE WERE HARDLY SO GAY EVERYONE APPEARED TO FEEL THAT A PARTING OF THAT SORT WAS AN AWKWARD THING AND THAT THE NEARER IT APPROACHED THE MORE AWKWARD IT WAS MR JACK MALDON TRIED TO BE VERY TALKATIVE BUT WAS NOT AT HIS EASE AND MADE MATTERS WORSE AND THEY WERE NOT IMPROVED AS IT APPEARED TO ME BY THE OLD SOLDIER WHO CONTINUALLY RECALLED PASSAGES OF MR JACK MALDONS YOUTH THE DOCTOR HOWEVER WHO FELT I AM SURE THAT HE WAS MAKING EVERYBODY HAPPY WAS WELL PLEASED AND HAD NO SUSPICION BUT THAT WE WERE ALL AT THE UTMOST HEIGHT OF ENJOYMENT ANNIE MY DEAR SAID HE LOOKING AT HIS WATCH AND FILLING HIS GLASS IT IS PAST YOUR COUSIN JACKS TIME AND WE MUST NOT DETAIN HIM SINCE TIME AND TIDEBOTH CONCERNED IN THIS CASEWAIT FOR NO MAN MR JACK MALDON YOU HAVE A LONG VOYAGE AND A STRANGE COUNTRY BEFORE YOU BUT MANY MEN HAVE HAD BOTH AND MANY MEN WILL HAVE BOTH TO THE END OF TIME THE WINDS YOU ARE GOING TO TEMPT HAVE WAFTED THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS TO FORTUNE AND BROUGHT THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS HAPPILY BACK ITS AN AFFECTING THING SAID MRS MARKLEHAMHOWEVER ITS VIEWED ITS AFFECTING TO SEE A FINE YOUNG MAN ONE HAS KNOWN FROM AN INFANT GOING AWAY TO THE OTHER END OF THE WORLD LEAVING ALL HE KNOWS BEHIND AND NOT KNOWING WHATS BEFORE HIM A YOUNG MAN REALLY WELL DESERVES CONSTANT SUPPORT AND PATRONAGE LOOKING AT THE DOCTOR WHO MAKES SUCH SACRIFICES TIME WILL GO FAST WITH YOU MR JACK MALDON PURSUED THE DOCTOR AND FAST WITH ALL OF US SOME OF US CAN HARDLY EXPECT PERHAPS IN THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS TO GREET YOU ON YOUR RETURN THE NEXT BEST THING IS TO HOPE TO DO IT AND THATS MY CASE I SHALL NOT WEARY YOU WITH GOOD ADVICE YOU HAVE LONG HAD A GOOD MODEL BEFORE YOU IN YOUR COUSIN ANNIE IMITATE HER VIRTUES AS NEARLY AS YOU CAN MRS MARKLEHAM FANNED HERSELF AND SHOOK HER HEAD FAREWELL MR JACK SAID THE DOCTOR STANDING UP ON WHICH WE ALL STOOD UP A PROSPEROUS VOYAGE OUT A THRIVING CAREER ABROAD AND A HAPPY RETURN HOME WE ALL DRANK THE TOAST AND ALL SHOOK HANDS WITH MR JACK MALDON AFTER WHICH HE HASTILY TOOK LEAVE OF THE LADIES WHO WERE THERE AND HURRIED TO THE DOOR WHERE HE WAS RECEIVED AS HE GOT INTO THE CHAISE WITH A TREMENDOUS BROADSIDE OF CHEERS DISCHARGED BY OUR BOYS WHO HAD ASSEMBLED ON THE LAWN FOR THE PURPOSE RUNNING IN AMONG THEM TO SWELL THE RANKS I WAS VERY NEAR THE CHAISE WHEN IT ROLLED AWAY AND I HAD A LIVELY IMPRESSION MADE UPON ME IN THE MIDST OF THE NOISE AND DUST OF HAVING SEEN MR JACK MALDON RATTLE PAST WITH AN AGITATED FACE AND SOMETHING CHERRYCOLOURED IN HIS HAND AFTER ANOTHER BROADSIDE FOR THE DOCTOR AND ANOTHER FOR THE DOCTORS WIFE THE BOYS DISPERSED AND I WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE WHERE I FOUND THE GUESTS ALL STANDING IN A GROUP ABOUT THE DOCTOR DISCUSSING HOW MR JACK MALDON HAD GONE AWAY AND HOW HE HAD BORNE IT AND HOW HE HAD FELT IT AND ALL THE REST OF IT IN THE MIDST OF THESE REMARKS MRS MARKLEHAM CRIED WHERES ANNIE NO ANNIE WAS THERE AND WHEN THEY CALLED TO HER NO ANNIE REPLIED BUT ALL PRESSING OUT OF THE ROOM IN A CROWD TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WE FOUND HER LYING ON THE HALL FLOOR THERE WAS GREAT ALARM AT FIRST UNTIL IT WAS FOUND THAT SHE WAS IN A SWOON AND THAT THE SWOON WAS YIELDING TO THE USUAL MEANS OF RECOVERY WHEN THE DOCTOR WHO HAD LIFTED HER HEAD UPON HIS KNEE PUT HER CURLS ASIDE WITH HIS HAND AND SAID LOOKING AROUND POOR ANNIE SHES SO FAITHFUL AND TENDERHEARTED ITS THE PARTING FROM HER OLD PLAYFELLOW AND FRIENDHER FAVOURITE COUSINTHAT HAS DONE THIS AH ITS A PITY I AM VERY SORRY WHEN SHE OPENED HER EYES AND SAW WHERE SHE WAS AND THAT WE WERE ALL STANDING ABOUT HER SHE AROSE WITH ASSISTANCE TURNING HER HEAD AS SHE DID SO TO LAY IT ON THE DOCTORS SHOULDEROR TO HIDE IT I DONT KNOW WHICH WE WENT INTO THE DRAWINGROOM TO LEAVE HER WITH THE DOCTOR AND HER MOTHER BUT SHE SAID IT SEEMED THAT SHE WAS BETTER THAN SHE HAD BEEN SINCE MORNING AND THAT SHE WOULD RATHER BE BROUGHT AMONG US SO THEY BROUGHT HER IN LOOKING VERY WHITE AND WEAK I THOUGHT AND SAT HER ON A SOFA ANNIE MY DEAR SAID HER MOTHER DOING SOMETHING TO HER DRESS SEE HERE YOU HAVE LOST A BOW WILL ANYBODY BE SO GOOD AS FIND A RIBBON A CHERRYCOLOURED RIBBON IT WAS THE ONE SHE HAD WORN AT HER BOSOM WE ALL LOOKED FOR IT I MYSELF LOOKED EVERYWHERE I AM CERTAINBUT NOBODY COULD FIND IT DO YOU RECOLLECT WHERE YOU HAD IT LAST ANNIE SAID HER MOTHER I WONDERED HOW I COULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE LOOKED WHITE OR ANYTHING BUT BURNING RED WHEN SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE HAD HAD IT SAFE A LITTLE WHILE AGO SHE THOUGHT BUT IT WAS NOT WORTH LOOKING FOR NEVERTHELESS IT WAS LOOKED FOR AGAIN AND STILL NOT FOUND SHE ENTREATED THAT THERE MIGHT BE NO MORE SEARCHING BUT IT WAS STILL SOUGHT FOR IN A DESULTORY WAY UNTIL SHE WAS QUITE WELL AND THE COMPANY TOOK THEIR DEPARTURE WE WALKED VERY SLOWLY HOME MR WICKFIELD AGNES AND IAGNES AND I ADMIRING THE MOONLIGHT AND MR WICKFIELD SCARCELY RAISING HIS EYES FROM THE GROUND WHEN WE AT LAST REACHED OUR OWN DOOR AGNES DISCOVERED THAT SHE HAD LEFT HER LITTLE RETICULE BEHIND DELIGHTED TO BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HER I RAN BACK TO FETCH IT I WENT INTO THE SUPPERROOM WHERE IT HAD BEEN LEFT WHICH WAS DESERTED AND DARK BUT A DOOR OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THAT AND THE DOCTORS STUDY WHERE THERE WAS A LIGHT BEING OPEN I PASSED ON THERE TO SAY WHAT I WANTED AND TO GET A CANDLE THE DOCTOR WAS SITTING IN HIS EASYCHAIR BY THE FIRESIDE AND HIS YOUNG WIFE WAS ON A STOOL AT HIS FEET THE DOCTOR WITH A COMPLACENT SMILE WAS READING ALOUD SOME MANUSCRIPT EXPLANATION OR STATEMENT OF A THEORY OUT OF THAT INTERMINABLE DICTIONARY AND SHE WAS LOOKING UP AT HIM BUT WITH SUCH A FACE AS I NEVER SAW IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL IN ITS FORM IT WAS SO ASHY PALE IT WAS SO FIXED IN ITS ABSTRACTION IT WAS SO FULL OF A WILD SLEEPWALKING DREAMY HORROR OF I DONT KNOW WHAT THE EYES WERE WIDE OPEN AND HER BROWN HAIR FELL IN TWO RICH CLUSTERS ON HER SHOULDERS AND ON HER WHITE DRESS DISORDERED BY THE WANT OF THE LOST RIBBON DISTINCTLY AS I RECOLLECT HER LOOK I CANNOT SAY OF WHAT IT WAS EXPRESSIVE I CANNOT EVEN SAY OF WHAT IT IS EXPRESSIVE TO ME NOW RISING AGAIN BEFORE MY OLDER JUDGEMENT PENITENCE HUMILIATION SHAME PRIDE LOVE AND TRUSTFULNESSI SEE THEM ALL AND IN THEM ALL I SEE THAT HORROR OF I DONT KNOW WHAT MY ENTRANCE AND MY SAYING WHAT I WANTED ROUSED HER IT DISTURBED THE DOCTOR TOO FOR WHEN I WENT BACK TO REPLACE THE CANDLE I HAD TAKEN FROM THE TABLE HE WAS PATTING HER HEAD IN HIS FATHERLY WAY AND SAYING HE WAS A MERCILESS DRONE TO LET HER TEMPT HIM INTO READING ON AND HE WOULD HAVE HER GO TO BED BUT SHE ASKED HIM IN A RAPID URGENT MANNER TO LET HER STAYTO LET HER FEEL ASSURED I HEARD HER MURMUR SOME BROKEN WORDS TO THIS EFFECT THAT SHE WAS IN HIS CONFIDENCE THAT NIGHT AND AS SHE TURNED AGAIN TOWARDS HIM AFTER GLANCING AT ME AS I LEFT THE ROOM AND WENT OUT AT THE DOOR I SAW HER CROSS HER HANDS UPON HIS KNEE AND LOOK UP AT HIM WITH THE SAME FACE SOMETHING QUIETED AS HE RESUMED HIS READING IT MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION ON ME AND I REMEMBERED IT A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS AS I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO NARRATE WHEN THE TIME COMES CHAPTER SOMEBODY TURNS UP IT HAS NOT OCCURRED TO ME TO MENTION PEGGOTTY SINCE I RAN AWAY BUT OF COURSE I WROTE HER A LETTER ALMOST AS SOON AS I WAS HOUSED AT DOVER AND ANOTHER AND A LONGER LETTER CONTAINING ALL PARTICULARS FULLY RELATED WHEN MY AUNT TOOK ME FORMALLY UNDER HER PROTECTION ON MY BEING SETTLED AT DOCTOR STRONGS I WROTE TO HER AGAIN DETAILING MY HAPPY CONDITION AND PROSPECTS I NEVER COULD HAVE DERIVED ANYTHING LIKE THE PLEASURE FROM SPENDING THE MONEY MR DICK HAD GIVEN ME THAT I FELT IN SENDING A GOLD HALFGUINEA TO PEGGOTTY PER POST ENCLOSED IN THIS LAST LETTER TO DISCHARGE THE SUM I HAD BORROWED OF HER IN WHICH EPISTLE NOT BEFORE I MENTIONED ABOUT THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE DONKEYCART TO THESE COMMUNICATIONS PEGGOTTY REPLIED AS PROMPTLY IF NOT AS CONCISELY AS A MERCHANTS CLERK HER UTMOST POWERS OF EXPRESSION WHICH WERE CERTAINLY NOT GREAT IN INK WERE EXHAUSTED IN THE ATTEMPT TO WRITE WHAT SHE FELT ON THE SUBJECT OF MY JOURNEY FOUR SIDES OF INCOHERENT AND INTERJECTIONAL BEGINNINGS OF SENTENCES THAT HAD NO END EXCEPT BLOTS WERE INADEQUATE TO AFFORD HER ANY RELIEF BUT THE BLOTS WERE MORE EXPRESSIVE TO ME THAN THE BEST COMPOSITION FOR THEY SHOWED ME THAT PEGGOTTY HAD BEEN CRYING ALL OVER THE PAPER AND WHAT COULD I HAVE DESIRED MORE I MADE OUT WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY THAT SHE COULD NOT TAKE QUITE KINDLY TO MY AUNT YET THE NOTICE WAS TOO SHORT AFTER SO LONG A PREPOSSESSION THE OTHER WAY WE NEVER KNEW A PERSON SHE WROTE BUT TO THINK THAT MISS BETSEY SHOULD SEEM TO BE SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT SHE HAD BEEN THOUGHT TO BE WAS A MORALTHAT WAS HER WORD SHE WAS EVIDENTLY STILL AFRAID OF MISS BETSEY FOR SHE SENT HER GRATEFUL DUTY TO HER BUT TIMIDLY AND SHE WAS EVIDENTLY AFRAID OF ME TOO AND ENTERTAINED THE PROBABILITY OF MY RUNNING AWAY AGAIN SOON IF I MIGHT JUDGE FROM THE REPEATED HINTS SHE THREW OUT THAT THE COACHFARE TO YARMOUTH WAS ALWAYS TO BE HAD OF HER FOR THE ASKING SHE GAVE ME ONE PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH AFFECTED ME VERY MUCH NAMELY THAT THERE HAD BEEN A SALE OF THE FURNITURE AT OUR OLD HOME AND THAT MR AND MISS MURDSTONE WERE GONE AWAY AND THE HOUSE WAS SHUT UP TO BE LET OR SOLD GOD KNOWS I HAD NO PART IN IT WHILE THEY REMAINED THERE BUT IT PAINED ME TO THINK OF THE DEAR OLD PLACE AS ALTOGETHER ABANDONED OF THE WEEDS GROWING TALL IN THE GARDEN AND THE FALLEN LEAVES LYING THICK AND WET UPON THE PATHS I IMAGINED HOW THE WINDS OF WINTER WOULD HOWL ROUND IT HOW THE COLD RAIN WOULD BEAT UPON THE WINDOWGLASS HOW THE MOON WOULD MAKE GHOSTS ON THE WALLS OF THE EMPTY ROOMS WATCHING THEIR SOLITUDE ALL NIGHT I THOUGHT AFRESH OF THE GRAVE IN THE CHURCHYARD UNDERNEATH THE TREE AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE HOUSE WERE DEAD TOO NOW AND ALL CONNECTED WITH MY FATHER AND MOTHER WERE FADED AWAY THERE WAS NO OTHER NEWS IN PEGGOTTYS LETTERS MR BARKIS WAS AN EXCELLENT HUSBAND SHE SAID THOUGH STILL A LITTLE NEAR BUT WE ALL HAD OUR FAULTS AND SHE HAD PLENTY THOUGH I AM SURE I DONT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE AND HE SENT HIS DUTY AND MY LITTLE BEDROOM WAS ALWAYS READY FOR ME MR PEGGOTTY WAS WELL AND HAM WAS WELL AND MRS GUMMIDGE WAS BUT POORLY AND LITTLE EMLY WOULDNT SEND HER LOVE BUT SAID THAT PEGGOTTY MIGHT SEND IT IF SHE LIKED ALL THIS INTELLIGENCE I DUTIFULLY IMPARTED TO MY AUNT ONLY RESERVING TO MYSELF THE MENTION OF LITTLE EMLY TO WHOM I INSTINCTIVELY FELT THAT SHE WOULD NOT VERY TENDERLY INCLINE WHILE I WAS YET NEW AT DOCTOR STRONGS SHE MADE SEVERAL EXCURSIONS OVER TO CANTERBURY TO SEE ME AND ALWAYS AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS WITH THE VIEW I SUPPOSE OF TAKING ME BY SURPRISE BUT FINDING ME WELL EMPLOYED AND BEARING A GOOD CHARACTER AND HEARING ON ALL HANDS THAT I ROSE FAST IN THE SCHOOL SHE SOON DISCONTINUED THESE VISITS I SAW HER ON A SATURDAY EVERY THIRD OR FOURTH WEEK WHEN I WENT OVER TO DOVER FOR A TREAT AND I SAW MR DICK EVERY ALTERNATE WEDNESDAY WHEN HE ARRIVED BY STAGECOACH AT NOON TO STAY UNTIL NEXT MORNING ON THESE OCCASIONS MR DICK NEVER TRAVELLED WITHOUT A LEATHERN WRITINGDESK CONTAINING A SUPPLY OF STATIONERY AND THE MEMORIAL IN RELATION TO WHICH DOCUMENT HE HAD A NOTION THAT TIME WAS BEGINNING TO PRESS NOW AND THAT IT REALLY MUST BE GOT OUT OF HAND MR DICK WAS VERY PARTIAL TO GINGERBREAD TO RENDER HIS VISITS THE MORE AGREEABLE MY AUNT HAD INSTRUCTED ME TO OPEN A CREDIT FOR HIM AT A CAKE SHOP WHICH WAS HAMPERED WITH THE STIPULATION THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE SERVED WITH MORE THAN ONE SHILLINGSWORTH IN THE COURSE OF ANY ONE DAY THIS AND THE REFERENCE OF ALL HIS LITTLE BILLS AT THE COUNTY INN WHERE HE SLEPT TO MY AUNT BEFORE THEY WERE PAID INDUCED ME TO SUSPECT THAT HE WAS ONLY ALLOWED TO RATTLE HIS MONEY AND NOT TO SPEND IT I FOUND ON FURTHER INVESTIGATION THAT THIS WAS SO OR AT LEAST THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN HIM AND MY AUNT THAT HE SHOULD ACCOUNT TO HER FOR ALL HIS DISBURSEMENTS AS HE HAD NO IDEA OF DECEIVING HER AND ALWAYS DESIRED TO PLEASE HER HE WAS THUS MADE CHARY OF LAUNCHING INTO EXPENSE ON THIS POINT AS WELL AS ON ALL OTHER POSSIBLE POINTS MR DICK WAS CONVINCED THAT MY AUNT WAS THE WISEST AND MOST WONDERFUL OF WOMEN AS HE REPEATEDLY TOLD ME WITH INFINITE SECRECY AND ALWAYS IN A WHISPER TROTWOOD SAID MR DICK WITH AN AIR OF MYSTERY AFTER IMPARTING THIS CONFIDENCE TO ME ONE WEDNESDAY WHOS THE MAN THAT HIDES NEAR OUR HOUSE AND FRIGHTENS HER FRIGHTENS MY AUNT SIR MR DICK NODDED I THOUGHT NOTHING WOULD HAVE FRIGHTENED HER HE SAID FOR SHES HERE HE WHISPERED SOFTLY DONT MENTION ITTHE WISEST AND MOST WONDERFUL OF WOMEN HAVING SAID WHICH HE DREW BACK TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT WHICH THIS DESCRIPTION OF HER MADE UPON ME THE FIRST TIME HE CAME SAID MR DICK WASLET ME SEESIXTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTYNINE WAS THE DATE OF KING CHARLESS EXECUTION I THINK YOU SAID SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTYNINE YES SIR I DONT KNOW HOW IT CAN BE SAID MR DICK SORELY PUZZLED AND SHAKING HIS HEAD I DONT THINK I AM AS OLD AS THAT WAS IT IN THAT YEAR THAT THE MAN APPEARED SIR I ASKED WHY REALLY SAID MR DICK I DONT SEE HOW IT CAN HAVE BEEN IN THAT YEAR TROTWOOD DID YOU GET THAT DATE OUT OF HISTORY YES SIR I SUPPOSE HISTORY NEVER LIES DOES IT SAID MR DICK WITH A GLEAM OF HOPE OH DEAR NO SIR I REPLIED MOST DECISIVELY I WAS INGENUOUS AND YOUNG AND I THOUGHT SO I CANT MAKE IT OUT SAID MR DICK SHAKING HIS HEAD THERES SOMETHING WRONG SOMEWHERE HOWEVER IT WAS VERY SOON AFTER THE MISTAKE WAS MADE OF PUTTING SOME OF THE TROUBLE OUT OF KING CHARLESS HEAD INTO MY HEAD THAT THE MAN FIRST CAME I WAS WALKING OUT WITH MISS TROTWOOD AFTER TEA JUST AT DARK AND THERE HE WAS CLOSE TO OUR HOUSE WALKING ABOUT I INQUIRED WALKING ABOUT REPEATED MR DICK LET ME SEE I MUST RECOLLECT A BIT NNO NO HE WAS NOT WALKING ABOUT I ASKED AS THE SHORTEST WAY TO GET AT IT WHAT HE WAS DOING WELL HE WASNT THERE AT ALL SAID MR DICK UNTIL HE CAME UP BEHIND HER AND WHISPERED THEN SHE TURNED ROUND AND FAINTED AND I STOOD STILL AND LOOKED AT HIM AND HE WALKED AWAY BUT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIDING EVER SINCE IN THE GROUND OR SOMEWHERE IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING HAS HE BEEN HIDING EVER SINCE I ASKED TO BE SURE HE HAS RETORTED MR DICK NODDING HIS HEAD GRAVELY NEVER CAME OUT TILL LAST NIGHT WE WERE WALKING LAST NIGHT AND HE CAME UP BEHIND HER AGAIN AND I KNEW HIM AGAIN AND DID HE FRIGHTEN MY AUNT AGAIN ALL OF A SHIVER SAID MR DICK COUNTERFEITING THAT AFFECTION AND MAKING HIS TEETH CHATTER HELD BY THE PALINGS CRIED BUT TROTWOOD COME HERE GETTING ME CLOSE TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT WHISPER VERY SOFTLY WHY DID SHE GIVE HIM MONEY BOY IN THE MOONLIGHT HE WAS A BEGGAR PERHAPS MR DICK SHOOK HIS HEAD AS UTTERLY RENOUNCING THE SUGGESTION AND HAVING REPLIED A GREAT MANY TIMES AND WITH GREAT CONFIDENCE NO BEGGAR NO BEGGAR NO BEGGAR SIR WENT ON TO SAY THAT FROM HIS WINDOW HE HAD AFTERWARDS AND LATE AT NIGHT SEEN MY AUNT GIVE THIS PERSON MONEY OUTSIDE THE GARDEN RAILS IN THE MOONLIGHT WHO THEN SLUNK AWAYINTO THE GROUND AGAIN AS HE THOUGHT PROBABLEAND WAS SEEN NO MORE WHILE MY AUNT CAME HURRIEDLY AND SECRETLY BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND HAD EVEN THAT MORNING BEEN QUITE DIFFERENT FROM HER USUAL SELF WHICH PREYED ON MR DICKS MIND I HAD NOT THE LEAST BELIEF IN THE OUTSET OF THIS STORY THAT THE UNKNOWN WAS ANYTHING BUT A DELUSION OF MR DICKS AND ONE OF THE LINE OF THAT ILLFATED PRINCE WHO OCCASIONED HIM SO MUCH DIFFICULTY BUT AFTER SOME REFLECTION I BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN THE QUESTION WHETHER AN ATTEMPT OR THREAT OF AN ATTEMPT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWICE MADE TO TAKE POOR MR DICK HIMSELF FROM UNDER MY AUNTS PROTECTION AND WHETHER MY AUNT THE STRENGTH OF WHOSE KIND FEELING TOWARDS HIM I KNEW FROM HERSELF MIGHT HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO PAY A PRICE FOR HIS PEACE AND QUIET AS I WAS ALREADY MUCH ATTACHED TO MR DICK AND VERY SOLICITOUS FOR HIS WELFARE MY FEARS FAVOURED THIS SUPPOSITION AND FOR A LONG TIME HIS WEDNESDAY HARDLY EVER CAME ROUND WITHOUT MY ENTERTAINING A MISGIVING THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ON THE COACHBOX AS USUAL THERE HE ALWAYS APPEARED HOWEVER GREYHEADED LAUGHING AND HAPPY AND HE NEVER HAD ANYTHING MORE TO TELL OF THE MAN WHO COULD FRIGHTEN MY AUNT THESE WEDNESDAYS WERE THE HAPPIEST DAYS OF MR DICKS LIFE THEY WERE FAR FROM BEING THE LEAST HAPPY OF MINE HE SOON BECAME KNOWN TO EVERY BOY IN THE SCHOOL AND THOUGH HE NEVER TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN ANY GAME BUT KITEFLYING WAS AS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN ALL OUR SPORTS AS ANYONE AMONG US HOW OFTEN HAVE I SEEN HIM INTENT UPON A MATCH AT MARBLES OR PEGTOP LOOKING ON WITH A FACE OF UNUTTERABLE INTEREST AND HARDLY BREATHING AT THE CRITICAL TIMES HOW OFTEN AT HARE AND HOUNDS HAVE I SEEN HIM MOUNTED ON A LITTLE KNOLL CHEERING THE WHOLE FIELD ON TO ACTION AND WAVING HIS HAT ABOVE HIS GREY HEAD OBLIVIOUS OF KING CHARLES THE MARTYRS HEAD AND ALL BELONGING TO IT HOW MANY A SUMMER HOUR HAVE I KNOWN TO BE BUT BLISSFUL MINUTES TO HIM IN THE CRICKETFIELD HOW MANY WINTER DAYS HAVE I SEEN HIM STANDING BLUENOSED IN THE SNOW AND EAST WIND LOOKING AT THE BOYS GOING DOWN THE LONG SLIDE AND CLAPPING HIS WORSTED GLOVES IN RAPTURE HE WAS AN UNIVERSAL FAVOURITE AND HIS INGENUITY IN LITTLE THINGS WAS TRANSCENDENT HE COULD CUT ORANGES INTO SUCH DEVICES AS NONE OF US HAD AN IDEA OF HE COULD MAKE A BOAT OUT OF ANYTHING FROM A SKEWER UPWARDS HE COULD TURN CRAMPBONES INTO CHESSMEN FASHION ROMAN CHARIOTS FROM OLD COURT CARDS MAKE SPOKED WHEELS OUT OF COTTON REELS AND BIRDCAGES OF OLD WIRE BUT HE WAS GREATEST OF ALL PERHAPS IN THE ARTICLES OF STRING AND STRAW WITH WHICH WE WERE ALL PERSUADED HE COULD DO ANYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE BY HANDS MR DICKS RENOWN WAS NOT LONG CONFINED TO US AFTER A FEW WEDNESDAYS DOCTOR STRONG HIMSELF MADE SOME INQUIRIES OF ME ABOUT HIM AND I TOLD HIM ALL MY AUNT HAD TOLD ME WHICH INTERESTED THE DOCTOR SO MUCH THAT HE REQUESTED ON THE OCCASION OF HIS NEXT VISIT TO BE PRESENTED TO HIM THIS CEREMONY I PERFORMED AND THE DOCTOR BEGGING MR DICK WHENSOEVER HE SHOULD NOT FIND ME AT THE COACH OFFICE TO COME ON THERE AND REST HIMSELF UNTIL OUR MORNINGS WORK WAS OVER IT SOON PASSED INTO A CUSTOM FOR MR DICK TO COME ON AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND IF WE WERE A LITTLE LATE AS OFTEN HAPPENED ON A WEDNESDAY TO WALK ABOUT THE COURTYARD WAITING FOR ME HERE HE MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE DOCTORS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WIFE PALER THAN FORMERLY ALL THIS TIME MORE RARELY SEEN BY ME OR ANYONE I THINK AND NOT SO GAY BUT NOT LESS BEAUTIFUL AND SO BECAME MORE AND MORE FAMILIAR BY DEGREES UNTIL AT LAST HE WOULD COME INTO THE SCHOOL AND WAIT HE ALWAYS SAT IN A PARTICULAR CORNER ON A PARTICULAR STOOL WHICH WAS CALLED DICK AFTER HIM HERE HE WOULD SIT WITH HIS GREY HEAD BENT FORWARD ATTENTIVELY LISTENING TO WHATEVER MIGHT BE GOING ON WITH A PROFOUND VENERATION FOR THE LEARNING HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE THIS VENERATION MR DICK EXTENDED TO THE DOCTOR WHOM HE THOUGHT THE MOST SUBTLE AND ACCOMPLISHED PHILOSOPHER OF ANY AGE IT WAS LONG BEFORE MR DICK EVER SPOKE TO HIM OTHERWISE THAN BAREHEADED AND EVEN WHEN HE AND THE DOCTOR HAD STRUCK UP QUITE A FRIENDSHIP AND WOULD WALK TOGETHER BY THE HOUR ON THAT SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WHICH WAS KNOWN AMONG US AS THE DOCTORS WALK MR DICK WOULD PULL OFF HIS HAT AT INTERVALS TO SHOW HIS RESPECT FOR WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE HOW IT EVER CAME ABOUT THAT THE DOCTOR BEGAN TO READ OUT SCRAPS OF THE FAMOUS DICTIONARY IN THESE WALKS I NEVER KNEW PERHAPS HE FELT IT ALL THE SAME AT FIRST AS READING TO HIMSELF HOWEVER IT PASSED INTO A CUSTOM TOO AND MR DICK LISTENING WITH A FACE SHINING WITH PRIDE AND PLEASURE IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS BELIEVED THE DICTIONARY TO BE THE MOST DELIGHTFUL BOOK IN THE WORLD AS I THINK OF THEM GOING UP AND DOWN BEFORE THOSE SCHOOLROOM WINDOWSTHE DOCTOR READING WITH HIS COMPLACENT SMILE AN OCCASIONAL FLOURISH OF THE MANUSCRIPT OR GRAVE MOTION OF HIS HEAD AND MR DICK LISTENING ENCHAINED BY INTEREST WITH HIS POOR WITS CALMLY WANDERING GOD KNOWS WHERE UPON THE WINGS OF HARD WORDSI THINK OF IT AS ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST THINGS IN A QUIET WAY THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN I FEEL AS IF THEY MIGHT GO WALKING TO AND FRO FOR EVER AND THE WORLD MIGHT SOMEHOW BE THE BETTER FOR ITAS IF A THOUSAND THINGS IT MAKES A NOISE ABOUT WERE NOT ONE HALF SO GOOD FOR IT OR ME AGNES WAS ONE OF MR DICKS FRIENDS VERY SOON AND IN OFTEN COMING TO THE HOUSE HE MADE ACQUAINTANCE WITH URIAH THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN HIMSELF AND ME INCREASED CONTINUALLY AND IT WAS MAINTAINED ON THIS ODD FOOTING THAT WHILE MR DICK CAME PROFESSEDLY TO LOOK AFTER ME AS MY GUARDIAN HE ALWAYS CONSULTED ME IN ANY LITTLE MATTER OF DOUBT THAT AROSE AND INVARIABLY GUIDED HIMSELF BY MY ADVICE NOT ONLY HAVING A HIGH RESPECT FOR MY NATIVE SAGACITY BUT CONSIDERING THAT I INHERITED A GOOD DEAL FROM MY AUNT ONE THURSDAY MORNING WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO WALK WITH MR DICK FROM THE HOTEL TO THE COACH OFFICE BEFORE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL FOR WE HAD AN HOURS SCHOOL BEFORE BREAKFAST I MET URIAH IN THE STREET WHO REMINDED ME OF THE PROMISE I HAD MADE TO TAKE TEA WITH HIMSELF AND HIS MOTHER ADDING WITH A WRITHE BUT I DIDNT EXPECT YOU TO KEEP IT MASTER COPPERFIELD WERE SO VERY UMBLE I REALLY HAD NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER I LIKED URIAH OR DETESTED HIM AND I WAS VERY DOUBTFUL ABOUT IT STILL AS I STOOD LOOKING HIM IN THE FACE IN THE STREET BUT I FELT IT QUITE AN AFFRONT TO BE SUPPOSED PROUD AND SAID I ONLY WANTED TO BE ASKED OH IF THATS ALL MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID URIAH AND IT REALLY ISNT OUR UMBLENESS THAT PREVENTS YOU WILL YOU COME THIS EVENING BUT IF IT IS OUR UMBLENESS I HOPE YOU WONT MIND OWNING TO IT MASTER COPPERFIELD FOR WE ARE WELL AWARE OF OUR CONDITION I SAID

AS READY TO URIAH MOTHER WILL BE PROUD INDEED HE SAID AS WE WALKED AWAY TOGETHER OR SHE WOULD BE PROUD IF IT WASNT SINFUL MASTER COPPERFIELD YET YOU DIDNT MIND SUPPOSING I WAS PROUD THIS MORNING I

THE UTMOST HUMILITY AND APOLOGIZED TO ME FOR GIVING HER SON A KISS OBSERVING THAT LOWLY AS THEY WERE THEY HAD THEIR NATURAL AFFECTIONS WHICH THEY HOPED WOULD GIVE NO OFFENCE TO ANYONE IT WAS A PERFECTLY DECENT ROOM HALF PARLOUR AND HALF KITCHEN BUT NOT AT ALL A SNUG ROOM THE TEATHINGS WERE SET UPON THE TABLE AND THE KETTLE WAS BOILING ON THE HOB THERE WAS A CHEST OF DRAWERS WITH AN ESCRITOIRE TOP FOR URIAH TO READ OR WRITE AT OF AN EVENING THERE WAS URIAHS BLUE BAG LYING DOWN AND VOMITING PAPERS THERE WAS A COMPANY OF URIAHS BOOKS COMMANDED BY MR TIDD THERE WAS A CORNER CUPBOARD AND THERE WERE THE USUAL ARTICLES OF FURNITURE I DONT REMEMBER THAT ANY INDIVIDUAL OBJECT HAD A BARE PINCHED SPARE LOOK BUT I DO REMEMBER THAT THE WHOLE PLACE HAD IT WAS PERHAPS A PART OF MRS HEEPS HUMILITY THAT SHE STILL WORE WEEDS NOTWITHSTANDING THE LAPSE OF TIME THAT HAD OCCURRED SINCE MR HEEPS DECEASE SHE STILL WORE WEEDS I THINK THERE WAS SOME COMPROMISE IN THE CAP BUT OTHERWISE SHE WAS AS WEEDY AS IN THE EARLY DAYS OF HER MOURNING THIS IS A DAY TO BE REMEMBERED MY URIAH I AM SURE SAID MRS HEEP MAKING THE TEA WHEN MASTER COPPERFIELD PAYS US A VISIT I SAID YOUD THINK SO MOTHER SAID URIAH IF I COULD HAVE WISHED FATHER TO REMAIN AMONG US FOR ANY REASON SAID MRS HEEP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT HE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN HIS COMPANY THIS AFTERNOON I FELT EMBARRASSED BY THESE COMPLIMENTS BUT I WAS SENSIBLE TOO OF BEING ENTERTAINED AS AN HONOURED GUEST AND I THOUGHT MRS HEEP AN AGREEABLE WOMAN MY URIAH SAID MRS HEEP HAS LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS SIR A LONG WHILE HE HAD HIS FEARS THAT OUR UMBLENESS

PAIR OF DENTISTS OR A LITTLE SHUTTLECOCK AGAINST TWO BATTLEDORES THAN I HAD AGAINST URIAH AND MRS HEEP THEY DID JUST WHAT THEY LIKED WITH ME AND WORMED THINGS OUT OF ME THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO TELL WITH A CERTAINTY I BLUSH TO THINK OF THE MORE ESPECIALLY AS IN MY JUVENILE FRANKNESS I TOOK SOME CREDIT TO MYSELF FOR BEING SO CONFIDENTIAL AND FELT THAT I WAS QUITE THE PATRON OF MY TWO RESPECTFUL ENTERTAINERS THEY WERE VERY FOND OF ONE ANOTHER THAT WAS CERTAIN I TAKE IT THAT HAD ITS EFFECT UPON ME AS A TOUCH OF NATURE BUT THE SKILL WITH WHICH THE ONE FOLLOWED UP WHATEVER THE OTHER SAID WAS A TOUCH OF ART WHICH I WAS STILL LESS PROOF AGAINST WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING MORE TO BE GOT OUT OF ME ABOUT MYSELF FOR ON THE MURDSTONE AND GRINBY LIFE AND ON MY JOURNEY I WAS DUMB THEY BEGAN ABOUT MR

ROOM AND STRONGLY FLAVOURED WITH TOBACCOSMOKE I THINK IT WAS OVER THE KITCHEN BECAUSE A WARM GREASY SMELL APPEARED TO COME UP THROUGH THE CHINKS IN THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS A FLABBY PERSPIRATION ON THE WALLS I KNOW IT WAS NEAR THE BAR ON ACCOUNT OF THE SMELL OF SPIRITS AND JINGLING OF GLASSES HERE RECUMBENT ON A SMALL SOFA UNDERNEATH A PICTURE OF A RACEHORSE WITH HER HEAD CLOSE TO THE FIRE AND HER FEET PUSHING THE MUSTARD OFF THE DUMBWAITER AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WAS MRS MICAWBER TO WHOM MR MICAWBER ENTERED FIRST SAYING MY DEAR ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A PUPIL OF DOCTOR STRONGS I NOTICED BY THE BY THAT ALTHOUGH MR MICAWBER WAS JUST AS MUCH CONFUSED AS EVER ABOUT MY AGE AND STANDING HE ALWAYS REMEMBERED AS A GENTEEL THING THAT I WAS A PUPIL OF DOCTOR STRONGS MRS MICAWBER WAS AMAZED BUT VERY GLAD TO SEE ME I WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE HER TOO AND AFTER AN AFFECTIONATE GREETING ON BOTH SIDES SAT DOWN ON THE SMALL SOFA NEAR HER MY DEAR SAID MR MICAWBER IF YOU WILL MENTION TO COPPERFIELD WHAT OUR PRESENT POSITION IS WHICH I HAVE NO DOUBT HE WILL LIKE TO KNOW I WILL GO AND LOOK AT THE PAPER THE WHILE AND SEE WHETHER ANYTHING TURNS UP AMONG THE ADVERTISEMENTS I THOUGHT YOU WERE AT PLYMOUTH MAAM I SAID TO MRS MICAWBER AS HE WENT OUT MY DEAR MASTER COPPERFIELD SHE REPLIED WE WENT TO PLYMOUTH TO BE ON THE SPOT I HINTED JUST SO SAID MRS MICAWBER TO BE ON THE SPOT BUT THE TRUTH IS TALENT IS NOT WANTED IN THE CUSTOM HOUSE THE LOCAL INFLUENCE OF MY FAMILY WAS QUITE UNAVAILING TO OBTAIN ANY EMPLOYMENT IN THAT DEPARTMENT FOR A MAN OF MR MICAWBERS ABILITIES THEY WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE A MAN OF MR MICAWBERS ABILITIES HE WOULD ONLY SHOW THE DEFICIENCY OF THE OTHERS APART FROM WHICH SAID MRS MICAWBER I WILL NOT DISGUISE FROM YOU MY DEAR MASTER COPPERFIELD THAT WHEN THAT BRANCH OF MY FAMILY WHICH IS SETTLED IN PLYMOUTH BECAME AWARE THAT MR MICAWBER WAS ACCOMPANIED BY MYSELF AND BY LITTLE WILKINS AND HIS SISTER AND BY THE TWINS THEY DID NOT RECEIVE HIM WITH THAT ARDOUR WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED BEING SO NEWLY RELEASED FROM CAPTIVITY IN FACT SAID MRS MICAWBER LOWERING HER VOICETHIS IS BETWEEN OURSELVESOUR RECEPTION WAS COOL DEAR ME I SAID YES SAID MRS MICAWBER IT IS TRULY PAINFUL TO CONTEMPLATE MANKIND IN SUCH AN ASPECT MASTER COPPERFIELD BUT OUR RECEPTION WAS DECIDEDLY COOL THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT IN FACT THAT BRANCH OF MY FAMILY WHICH IS SETTLED IN PLYMOUTH BECAME QUITE PERSONAL TO MR MICAWBER BEFORE WE HAD BEEN THERE A WEEK I SAID AND THOUGHT THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES STILL SO IT WAS CONTINUED MRS MICAWBER UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT COULD A MAN OF MR MICAWBERS SPIRIT DO BUT ONE OBVIOUS COURSE WAS LEFT TO BORROW OF THAT BRANCH OF MY FAMILY THE MONEY TO RETURN TO LONDON AND TO RETURN AT ANY SACRIFICE THEN YOU ALL CAME BACK AGAIN MAAM I SAID WE ALL CAME BACK AGAIN REPLIED MRS MICAWBER SINCE THEN I HAVE CONSULTED OTHER BRANCHES OF MY FAMILY ON THE COURSE WHICH IT IS MOST EXPEDIENT FOR MR MICAWBER TO TAKEFOR I MAINTAIN THAT HE MUST TAKE SOME COURSE MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID MRS MICAWBER ARGUMENTATIVELY IT IS CLEAR THAT A FAMILY OF SIX NOT INCLUDING A DOMESTIC CANNOT LIVE UPON AIR CERTAINLY MAAM SAID I THE OPINION OF THOSE OTHER BRANCHES OF MY FAMILY PURSUED MRS MICAWBER IS THAT MR MICAWBER SHOULD IMMEDIATELY TURN HIS ATTENTION TO COALS TO WHAT MAAM TO COALS SAID MRS MICAWBER TO THE COAL TRADE MR MICAWBER WAS INDUCED TO THINK ON INQUIRY THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN OPENING FOR A MAN OF HIS TALENT IN THE MEDWAY COAL TRADE THEN AS MR MICAWBER VERY PROPERLY SAID THE FIRST STEP TO BE TAKEN CLEARLY WAS TO COME AND SEE THE MEDWAY WHICH WE CAME AND SAW I SAY WE MASTER COPPERFIELD FOR I NEVER WILL SAID MRS MICAWBER WITH EMOTION I NEVER WILL DESERT MR MICAWBER I MURMURED MY ADMIRATION AND APPROBATION WE CAME REPEATED MRS MICAWBER AND SAW THE MEDWAY MY OPINION OF THE COAL TRADE ON THAT RIVER IS THAT IT MAY REQUIRE TALENT BUT THAT IT CERTAINLY REQUIRES CAPITAL TALENT MR MICAWBER HAS CAPITAL MR MICAWBER HAS NOT WE SAW I THINK THE GREATER PART OF THE MEDWAY AND THAT IS MY INDIVIDUAL CONCLUSION BEING SO NEAR HERE MR MICAWBER WAS OF OPINION THAT IT WOULD BE RASH NOT TO COME ON AND SEE THE CATHEDRAL FIRSTLY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BEING SO WELL WORTH SEEING AND OUR NEVER HAVING SEEN IT AND SECONDLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT PROBABILITY OF SOMETHING TURNING UP IN A CATHEDRAL TOWN WE HAVE BEEN HERE SAID MRS MICAWBER THREE DAYS NOTHING HAS AS YET TURNED UP AND IT MAY NOT SURPRISE YOU MY DEAR MASTER COPPERFIELD SO MUCH AS IT WOULD A STRANGER TO KNOW THAT WE ARE AT PRESENT WAITING FOR A REMITTANCE FROM LONDON TO DISCHARGE OUR PECUNIARY OBLIGATIONS AT THIS HOTEL UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF THAT REMITTANCE SAID MRS MICAWBER WITH MUCH FEELING I AM CUT OFF FROM MY HOME I ALLUDE TO LODGINGS IN PENTONVILLE FROM MY BOY AND GIRL AND FROM MY TWINS I FELT THE UTMOST SYMPATHY FOR MR AND MRS MICAWBER IN THIS ANXIOUS EXTREMITY AND SAID AS MUCH TO MR MICAWBER WHO NOW RETURNED ADDING THAT I ONLY WISHED I HAD MONEY ENOUGH TO LEND THEM THE AMOUNT THEY NEEDED MR MICAWBERS ANSWER EXPRESSED THE DISTURBANCE OF HIS MIND HE SAID SHAKING HANDS WITH ME COPPERFIELD YOU ARE A TRUE FRIEND BUT WHEN THE WORST COMES TO THE WORST NO MAN IS WITHOUT A FRIEND WHO IS POSSESSED OF SHAVING MATERIALS AT THIS DREADFUL HINT MRS MICAWBER THREW HER ARMS ROUND MR MICAWBERS NECK AND ENTREATED HIM TO BE CALM HE WEPT BUT SO FAR RECOVERED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AS TO RING THE BELL FOR THE WAITER AND BESPEAK A HOT KIDNEY PUDDING AND A PLATE OF SHRIMPS FOR BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING WHEN I TOOK MY LEAVE OF THEM THEY BOTH PRESSED ME SO MUCH TO COME AND DINE BEFORE THEY WENT AWAY THAT I COULD NOT REFUSE BUT AS I KNEW I COULD NOT COME NEXT DAY WHEN I SHOULD HAVE A GOOD DEAL TO PREPARE IN THE EVENING MR MICAWBER ARRANGED THAT HE WOULD CALL AT DOCTOR STRONGS IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING HAVING A PRESENTIMENT THAT THE REMITTANCE WOULD ARRIVE BY THAT POST AND PROPOSE THE DAY AFTER IF IT WOULD SUIT ME BETTER ACCORDINGLY I WAS CALLED OUT OF SCHOOL NEXT FORENOON AND FOUND MR MICAWBER IN THE PARLOUR WHO HAD CALLED TO SAY THAT THE DINNER WOULD TAKE PLACE AS PROPOSED WHEN I ASKED HIM IF THE REMITTANCE HAD COME HE PRESSED MY HAND AND DEPARTED AS I WAS LOOKING OUT OF WINDOW THAT SAME EVENING IT SURPRISED ME AND MADE ME RATHER UNEASY TO SEE MR MICAWBER AND URIAH HEEP WALK PAST ARM IN ARM URIAH HUMBLY SENSIBLE OF THE HONOUR THAT WAS DONE HIM AND MR MICAWBER TAKING A BLAND DELIGHT IN EXTENDING HIS PATRONAGE TO URIAH BUT I WAS STILL MORE SURPRISED WHEN I WENT TO THE LITTLE HOTEL NEXT DAY AT THE APPOINTED DINNERHOUR WHICH WAS FOUR OCLOCK TO FIND FROM WHAT MR MICAWBER SAID THAT HE HAD GONE HOME WITH URIAH AND HAD DRUNK BRANDYANDWATER AT MRS HEEPS AND ILL TELL YOU WHAT MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER YOUR FRIEND HEEP IS A YOUNG FELLOW WHO MIGHT BE ATTORNEYGENERAL IF I HAD KNOWN THAT YOUNG MAN AT THE PERIOD WHEN MY DIFFICULTIES CAME TO A CRISIS ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I BELIEVE MY CREDITORS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL BETTER MANAGED THAN THEY WERE I HARDLY UNDERSTOOD HOW THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SEEING THAT MR MICAWBER HAD PAID THEM NOTHING AT ALL AS IT WAS BUT I DID NOT LIKE TO ASK NEITHER DID I LIKE TO SAY THAT I HOPED HE HAD NOT BEEN TOO COMMUNICATIVE TO URIAH OR TO INQUIRE IF THEY HAD TALKED MUCH ABOUT ME I WAS AFRAID OF HURTING MR MICAWBERS FEELINGS OR AT ALL EVENTS MRS MICAWBERS SHE BEING VERY SENSITIVE BUT I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT IT TOO AND OFTEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS WE HAD A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE DINNER QUITE AN ELEGANT DISH OF FISH THE KIDNEYEND OF A LOIN OF VEAL ROASTED FRIED SAUSAGEMEAT A PARTRIDGE AND A PUDDING THERE WAS WINE AND THERE WAS STRONG ALE AND AFTER DINNER MRS MICAWBER MADE US A BOWL OF HOT PUNCH WITH HER OWN HANDS MR MICAWBER WAS UNCOMMONLY CONVIVIAL I NEVER SAW HIM SUCH GOOD COMPANY HE MADE HIS FACE SHINE WITH THE PUNCH SO THAT IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN VARNISHED ALL OVER HE GOT CHEERFULLY SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THE TOWN AND PROPOSED SUCCESS TO IT OBSERVING THAT MRS MICAWBER AND HIMSELF HAD BEEN MADE EXTREMELY SNUG AND COMFORTABLE THERE AND THAT HE NEVER SHOULD FORGET THE AGREEABLE HOURS THEY HAD PASSED IN CANTERBURY HE PROPOSED ME AFTERWARDS AND HE AND MRS MICAWBER AND I TOOK A REVIEW OF OUR PAST ACQUAINTANCE IN THE COURSE OF WHICH WE SOLD THE PROPERTY ALL OVER AGAIN THEN I PROPOSED MRS MICAWBER OR AT LEAST SAID MODESTLY IF YOULL ALLOW ME MRS MICAWBER I SHALL NOW HAVE THE PLEASURE OF DRINKING YOUR HEALTH MAAM ON WHICH MR MICAWBER DELIVERED AN EULOGIUM ON MRS MICAWBERS CHARACTER AND SAID SHE HAD EVER BEEN HIS GUIDE PHILOSOPHER AND FRIEND AND THAT HE WOULD RECOMMEND ME WHEN I CAME TO A MARRYING TIME OF LIFE TO MARRY SUCH ANOTHER WOMAN IF SUCH ANOTHER WOMAN COULD BE FOUND AS THE PUNCH DISAPPEARED MR MICAWBER BECAME STILL MORE FRIENDLY AND CONVIVIAL MRS MICAWBERS SPIRITS BECOMING ELEVATED TOO WE SANG AULD LANG SYNE WHEN WE CAME TO HERES A HAND MY TRUSTY FRERE WE ALL JOINED HANDS ROUND THE TABLE AND WHEN WE DECLARED WE WOULD TAKE A RIGHT GUDE WILLIE WAUGHT AND HADNT THE LEAST IDEA WHAT IT MEANT WE WERE REALLY AFFECTED IN A WORD I NEVER SAW ANYBODY SO THOROUGHLY JOVIAL AS MR MICAWBER WAS DOWN TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT OF THE EVENING WHEN I TOOK A HEARTY FAREWELL OF HIMSELF AND HIS AMIABLE WIFE CONSEQUENTLY I WAS NOT PREPARED AT SEVEN OCLOCK NEXT MORNING TO RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING COMMUNICATION DATED HALF PAST NINE IN THE EVENING A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTER I HAD LEFT HIM MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND THE DIE IS CASTALL IS OVER HIDING THE RAVAGES OF CARE WITH A SICKLY MASK OF MIRTH I HAVE NOT INFORMED YOU THIS EVENING THAT THERE IS NO HOPE OF THE REMITTANCE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ALIKE HUMILIATING TO ENDURE HUMILIATING TO CONTEMPLATE AND HUMILIATING TO RELATE I HAVE DISCHARGED THE PECUNIARY LIABILITY CONTRACTED AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT BY GIVING A NOTE OF HAND MADE PAYABLE FOURTEEN DAYS AFTER DATE AT MY RESIDENCE PENTONVILLE LONDON WHEN IT BECOMES DUE IT WILL NOT BE TAKEN UP THE RESULT IS DESTRUCTION THE BOLT IS IMPENDING AND THE TREE MUST FALL LET THE WRETCHED MAN WHO NOW ADDRESSES YOU MY DEAR COPPERFIELD BE A BEACON TO YOU THROUGH LIFE HE WRITES WITH THAT INTENTION AND IN THAT HOPE IF HE COULD THINK HIMSELF OF SO MUCH USE ONE GLEAM OF DAY MIGHT BY POSSIBILITY PENETRATE INTO THE CHEERLESS DUNGEON OF HIS REMAINING EXISTENCETHOUGH HIS LONGEVITY IS AT PRESENT TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT EXTREMELY PROBLEMATICAL THIS IS THE LAST COMMUNICATION MY DEAR COPPERFIELD YOU WILL EVER RECEIVE FROM THE BEGGARED OUTCAST WILKINS MICAWBER I WAS SO SHOCKED BY THE CONTENTS OF THIS HEARTRENDING LETTER THAT I RAN OFF DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE LITTLE HOTEL WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING IT ON MY WAY TO DOCTOR STRONGS AND TRYING TO SOOTHE MR MICAWBER WITH A WORD OF COMFORT BUT HALFWAY THERE I MET THE LONDON COACH WITH MR AND MRS MICAWBER UP BEHIND MR MICAWBER THE VERY PICTURE OF TRANQUIL ENJOYMENT SMILING AT MRS MICAWBERS CONVERSATION EATING WALNUTS OUT OF A PAPER BAG WITH A BOTTLE STICKING OUT OF HIS BREAST POCKET AS THEY DID NOT SEE ME I THOUGHT IT BEST ALL THINGS CONSIDERED NOT TO SEE THEM SO WITH A GREAT WEIGHT TAKEN OFF MY MIND I TURNED INTO A BYSTREET THAT WAS THE NEAREST WAY TO SCHOOL AND FELT UPON THE WHOLE RELIEVED THAT THEY WERE GONE THOUGH I STILL LIKED THEM VERY MUCH NEVERTHELESS CHAPTER A RETROSPECT MY SCHOOLDAYS THE SILENT GLIDING ON OF MY EXISTENCETHE UNSEEN UNFELT PROGRESS OF MY LIFEFROM CHILDHOOD UP TO YOUTH LET ME THINK AS I LOOK BACK UPON THAT FLOWING WATER NOW A DRY CHANNEL OVERGROWN WITH LEAVES WHETHER THERE ARE ANY MARKS ALONG ITS COURSE BY WHICH I CAN REMEMBER HOW IT RAN A MOMENT AND I OCCUPY MY PLACE IN THE CATHEDRAL WHERE WE ALL WENT TOGETHER EVERY SUNDAY MORNING ASSEMBLING FIRST AT SCHOOL FOR THAT PURPOSE THE EARTHY SMELL THE SUNLESS AIR THE SENSATION OF THE WORLD BEING SHUT OUT THE RESOUNDING OF THE ORGAN THROUGH THE BLACK AND WHITE ARCHED GALLERIES AND AISLES ARE WINGS THAT TAKE ME BACK AND HOLD ME HOVERING ABOVE THOSE DAYS IN A HALFSLEEPING AND HALFWAKING DREAM I AM NOT THE LAST BOY IN THE SCHOOL I HAVE RISEN IN A FEW MONTHS OVER SEVERAL HEADS BUT THE FIRST BOY SEEMS TO ME A MIGHTY CREATURE DWELLING AFAR OFF WHOSE GIDDY HEIGHT IS UNATTAINABLE AGNES SAYS NO BUT I SAY YES AND TELL HER THAT SHE LITTLE THINKS WHAT STORES OF KNOWLEDGE HAVE BEEN MASTERED BY THE WONDERFUL BEING AT WHOSE PLACE SHE THINKS I EVEN I WEAK ASPIRANT MAY ARRIVE IN TIME HE IS NOT MY PRIVATE FRIEND AND PUBLIC PATRON AS STEERFORTH WAS BUT I HOLD HIM IN A REVERENTIAL RESPECT I CHIEFLY WONDER WHAT HELL BE WHEN HE LEAVES DOCTOR STRONGS AND WHAT MANKIND WILL DO TO MAINTAIN ANY PLACE AGAINST HIM BUT WHO IS THIS THAT BREAKS UPON ME THIS IS MISS SHEPHERD WHOM I LOVE MISS SHEPHERD IS A BOARDER AT THE MISSES NETTINGALLS ESTABLISHMENT I ADORE MISS SHEPHERD SHE IS A LITTLE GIRL IN A SPENCER WITH A ROUND FACE AND CURLY FLAXEN HAIR THE MISSES NETTINGALLS YOUNG LADIES COME TO THE CATHEDRAL TOO I CANNOT LOOK UPON MY BOOK FOR I MUST LOOK UPON MISS SHEPHERD WHEN THE CHORISTERS CHAUNT I HEAR MISS SHEPHERD IN THE SERVICE I MENTALLY INSERT MISS SHEPHERDS NAMEI PUT HER IN AMONG THE ROYAL FAMILY AT HOME IN MY OWN ROOM I AM SOMETIMES MOVED TO CRY OUT OH MISS SHEPHERD IN A TRANSPORT OF LOVE FOR SOME TIME I AM DOUBTFUL OF MISS SHEPHERDS FEELINGS BUT AT LENGTH FATE BEING PROPITIOUS WE MEET AT THE DANCINGSCHOOL I HAVE MISS SHEPHERD FOR MY PARTNER I TOUCH MISS SHEPHERDS GLOVE AND FEEL A THRILL GO UP THE RIGHT ARM OF MY JACKET AND COME OUT AT MY HAIR I SAY NOTHING TO MISS SHEPHERD BUT WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER MISS SHEPHERD AND MYSELF LIVE BUT TO BE UNITED WHY DO I SECRETLY GIVE MISS SHEPHERD TWELVE BRAZIL NUTS FOR A PRESENT I WONDER THEY ARE NOT EXPRESSIVE OF AFFECTION THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO PACK INTO A PARCEL OF ANY REGULAR SHAPE THEY ARE HARD TO CRACK EVEN IN ROOM DOORS AND THEY ARE OILY WHEN CRACKED YET I FEEL THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE TO MISS SHEPHERD SOFT SEEDY BISCUITS ALSO I BESTOW UPON MISS SHEPHERD AND ORANGES INNUMERABLE ONCE I KISS MISS SHEPHERD IN THE CLOAKROOM ECSTASY WHAT ARE MY AGONY AND INDIGNATION NEXT DAY WHEN I HEAR A FLYING RUMOUR THAT THE MISSES NETTINGALL HAVE STOOD MISS SHEPHERD IN THE STOCKS FOR TURNING IN HER TOES MISS SHEPHERD BEING THE ONE PERVADING THEME AND VISION OF MY LIFE HOW DO I EVER COME TO BREAK WITH HER I CANT CONCEIVE AND YET A COOLNESS GROWS BETWEEN MISS SHEPHERD AND MYSELF WHISPERS REACH ME OF MISS SHEPHERD HAVING SAID SHE WISHED I WOULDNT STARE SO AND HAVING AVOWED A PREFERENCE FOR MASTER JONESFOR JONES A BOY OF NO MERIT WHATEVER THE GULF BETWEEN ME AND MISS SHEPHERD WIDENS AT LAST ONE DAY I MEET THE MISSES NETTINGALLS ESTABLISHMENT OUT WALKING MISS SHEPHERD MAKES A FACE AS SHE GOES BY AND LAUGHS TO HER COMPANION ALL IS OVER THE DEVOTION OF A LIFEIT SEEMS A LIFE IT IS ALL THE SAMEIS AT AN END MISS SHEPHERD COMES OUT OF THE MORNING SERVICE AND THE ROYAL FAMILY KNOW HER NO MORE I AM HIGHER IN THE SCHOOL AND NO ONE BREAKS MY PEACE I AM NOT AT ALL POLITE NOW TO THE MISSES NETTINGALLS YOUNG LADIES AND SHOULDNT DOTE ON ANY OF THEM IF THEY WERE TWICE AS MANY AND TWENTY TIMES AS BEAUTIFUL I THINK THE DANCINGSCHOOL A TIRESOME AFFAIR AND WONDER WHY THE GIRLS CANT DANCE BY THEMSELVES AND LEAVE US ALONE I AM GROWING GREAT IN LATIN VERSES AND NEGLECT THE LACES OF MY BOOTS DOCTOR STRONG REFERS TO ME IN PUBLIC AS A PROMISING YOUNG SCHOLAR MR DICK IS WILD WITH JOY AND MY AUNT REMITS ME A GUINEA BY THE NEXT POST THE SHADE OF A YOUNG BUTCHER RISES LIKE THE APPARITION OF AN ARMED HEAD IN MACBETH WHO IS THIS YOUNG BUTCHER HE IS THE TERROR OF THE YOUTH OF CANTERBURY THERE IS A VAGUE BELIEF ABROAD THAT THE BEEF SUET WITH WHICH HE ANOINTS HIS HAIR GIVES HIM UNNATURAL STRENGTH AND THAT HE IS A MATCH FOR A MAN HE IS A BROADFACED BULLNECKED YOUNG BUTCHER WITH ROUGH RED CHEEKS AN ILLCONDITIONED MIND AND AN INJURIOUS TONGUE HIS MAIN USE OF THIS TONGUE IS TO DISPARAGE DOCTOR STRONGS YOUNG GENTLEMEN HE SAYS PUBLICLY THAT IF THEY WANT ANYTHING HELL GIVE IT EM HE NAMES INDIVIDUALS AMONG THEM MYSELF INCLUDED WHOM HE COULD UNDERTAKE TO SETTLE WITH ONE HAND AND THE OTHER TIED BEHIND HIM HE WAYLAYS THE SMALLER BOYS TO PUNCH THEIR UNPROTECTED HEADS AND CALLS CHALLENGES AFTER ME IN THE OPEN STREETS FOR THESE SUFFICIENT REASONS I RESOLVE TO FIGHT THE BUTCHER IT IS A SUMMER EVENING DOWN IN A GREEN HOLLOW AT THE CORNER OF A WALL I MEET THE BUTCHER BY APPOINTMENT I AM ATTENDED BY A SELECT BODY OF OUR BOYS THE BUTCHER BY TWO OTHER BUTCHERS A YOUNG PUBLICAN AND A SWEEP THE PRELIMINARIES ARE ADJUSTED AND THE BUTCHER AND MYSELF STAND FACE TO FACE IN A MOMENT THE BUTCHER LIGHTS TEN THOUSAND CANDLES OUT OF MY LEFT EYEBROW IN ANOTHER MOMENT I DONT KNOW WHERE THE WALL IS OR WHERE I AM OR WHERE ANYBODY IS I HARDLY KNOW WHICH IS MYSELF AND WHICH THE BUTCHER WE ARE ALWAYS IN SUCH A TANGLE AND TUSSLE KNOCKING ABOUT UPON THE TRODDEN GRASS SOMETIMES I SEE THE BUTCHER BLOODY BUT CONFIDENT SOMETIMES I SEE NOTHING AND SIT GASPING ON MY SECONDS KNEE SOMETIMES I GO IN AT THE BUTCHER MADLY AND CUT MY KNUCKLES OPEN AGAINST HIS FACE WITHOUT APPEARING TO DISCOMPOSE HIM AT ALL AT LAST I AWAKE VERY QUEER ABOUT THE HEAD AS FROM A GIDDY SLEEP AND SEE THE BUTCHER WALKING OFF CONGRATULATED BY THE TWO OTHER BUTCHERS AND THE SWEEP AND PUBLICAN AND PUTTING ON HIS COAT AS HE GOES FROM WHICH I AUGUR JUSTLY THAT THE VICTORY IS HIS I AM TAKEN HOME IN A SAD PLIGHT AND I HAVE BEEFSTEAKS PUT TO MY EYES AND AM RUBBED WITH VINEGAR AND BRANDY AND FIND A GREAT PUFFY PLACE BURSTING OUT ON MY UPPER LIP WHICH SWELLS IMMODERATELY FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS I REMAIN AT HOME A VERY ILLLOOKING SUBJECT WITH A GREEN SHADE OVER MY EYES AND I SHOULD BE VERY DULL BUT THAT AGNES IS A SISTER TO ME AND CONDOLES WITH ME AND READS TO ME AND MAKES THE TIME LIGHT AND HAPPY AGNES HAS MY CONFIDENCE COMPLETELY ALWAYS I TELL HER ALL ABOUT THE BUTCHER AND THE WRONGS HE HAS HEAPED UPON ME SHE THINKS I COULDNT HAVE DONE OTHERWISE THAN FIGHT THE BUTCHER WHILE SHE SHRINKS AND TREMBLES AT MY HAVING FOUGHT HIM TIME HAS STOLEN ON UNOBSERVED FOR ADAMS IS NOT THE HEADBOY IN THE DAYS THAT ARE COME NOW NOR HAS HE BEEN THIS MANY AND MANY A DAY ADAMS HAS LEFT THE SCHOOL SO LONG THAT WHEN HE COMES BACK ON A VISIT TO DOCTOR STRONG THERE ARE NOT MANY THERE BESIDES MYSELF WHO KNOW HIM ADAMS IS GOING TO BE CALLED TO THE BAR ALMOST DIRECTLY AND IS TO BE AN ADVOCATE AND TO WEAR A WIG I AM SURPRISED TO FIND HIM A MEEKER MAN THAN I HAD THOUGHT AND LESS IMPOSING IN APPEARANCE HE HAS NOT STAGGERED THE WORLD YET EITHER FOR IT GOES ON AS WELL AS I CAN MAKE OUT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS IF HE HAD NEVER JOINED IT A BLANK THROUGH WHICH THE WARRIORS OF POETRY AND HISTORY MARCH ON IN STATELY HOSTS THAT SEEM TO HAVE NO ENDAND WHAT COMES NEXT I AM THE HEADBOY NOW I LOOK DOWN ON THE LINE OF BOYS BELOW ME WITH A CONDESCENDING INTEREST IN SUCH OF THEM AS BRING TO MY MIND THE BOY I WAS MYSELF WHEN I FIRST CAME THERE THAT LITTLE FELLOW SEEMS TO BE NO PART OF ME I REMEMBER HIM AS SOMETHING LEFT BEHIND UPON THE ROAD OF LIFEAS SOMETHING I HAVE PASSED RATHER THAN HAVE ACTUALLY BEENAND ALMOST THINK OF HIM AS OF SOMEONE ELSE AND THE LITTLE GIRL I SAW ON THAT FIRST DAY AT MR WICKFIELDS WHERE IS SHE GONE ALSO IN HER STEAD THE PERFECT LIKENESS OF THE PICTURE A

BE THREE OR FOUR YEARS OLDER PERHAPS THE ELDEST MISS LARKINS MAY BE ABOUT THIRTY MY PASSION FOR HER IS BEYOND ALL BOUNDS THE ELDEST MISS LARKINS KNOWS OFFICERS IT IS AN AWFUL THING TO BEAR I SEE THEM SPEAKING TO HER IN THE STREET I SEE THEM CROSS THE WAY TO MEET HER WHEN HER BONNET SHE HAS A BRIGHT TASTE IN BONNETS IS SEEN COMING DOWN THE PAVEMENT ACCOMPANIED BY HER SISTERS BONNET SHE LAUGHS AND

DESERVE A BOW NOW AND THEN THE RAGING AGONIES I SUFFER ON THE NIGHT OF THE RACE BALL WHERE I KNOW THE ELDEST MISS LARKINS WILL BE DANCING WITH THE MILITARY OUGHT TO HAVE SOME COMPENSATION IF THERE BE EVENHANDED JUSTICE IN THE WORLD MY PASSION TAKES AWAY MY APPETITE AND MAKES ME WEAR MY NEWEST SILK NECKERCHIEF CONTINUALLY I HAVE NO RELIEF BUT IN PUTTING ON MY BEST CLOTHES AND HAVING MY BOOTS

IS COPYING DO YOU HEAR HIM PAPATHE ELDEST MISS LARKINS TOTO CAPTAIN BAILEY I HAVE JUST ENOUGH POWER TO ASK NO TO NO CAPTAIN TO MR CHESTLE A HOPGROWER I AM TERRIBLY DEJECTED FOR ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO I TAKE OFF MY RING I WEAR MY WORST CLOTHES I USE NO BEARS GREASE AND I FREQUENTLY LAMENT OVER THE LATE MISS LARKINSS FADED FLOWER BEING BY THAT TIME RATHER TIRED OF THIS KIND OF LIFE AND HAVING RECEIVED NEW PROVOCATION FROM THE BUTCHER I THROW THE FLOWER AWAY GO OUT WITH THE BUTCHER AND GLORIOUSLY DEFEAT HIM THIS AND THE RESUMPTION OF MY RING AS WELL AS OF THE BEARS GREASE IN MODERATION ARE THE LAST MARKS I CAN DISCERN NOW IN MY PROGRESS TO SEVENTEEN CHAPTER I LOOK ABOUT ME AND MAKE A DISCOVERY I AM DOUBTFUL WHETHER I WAS AT HEART GLAD OR SORRY WHEN MY SCHOOLDAYS DREW TO AN END AND THE TIME CAME FOR MY LEAVING DOCTOR STRONGS I HAD BEEN VERY HAPPY THERE I HAD A GREAT ATTACHMENT FOR THE DOCTOR AND I WAS EMINENT AND DISTINGUISHED IN THAT LITTLE WORLD FOR THESE REASONS I WAS SORRY TO GO BUT FOR OTHER REASONS UNSUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH I WAS GLAD MISTY IDEAS OF BEING A YOUNG MAN AT MY OWN DISPOSAL OF THE IMPORTANCE ATTACHING TO A YOUNG MAN AT HIS OWN DISPOSAL OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS TO BE SEEN AND DONE BY THAT MAGNIFICENT ANIMAL AND THE WONDERFUL EFFECTS HE COULD NOT FAIL TO MAKE UPON SOCIETY LURED ME AWAY SO POWERFUL WERE THESE VISIONARY CONSIDERATIONS IN MY BOYISH MIND THAT I SEEM ACCORDING TO MY PRESENT WAY OF THINKING TO HAVE LEFT SCHOOL WITHOUT NATURAL REGRET THE SEPARATION HAS NOT MADE THE IMPRESSION ON ME THAT OTHER SEPARATIONS HAVE I TRY IN VAIN TO RECALL HOW I FELT ABOUT IT AND WHAT ITS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE BUT IT IS NOT MOMENTOUS IN MY RECOLLECTION I SUPPOSE THE OPENING PROSPECT CONFUSED ME I KNOW THAT MY JUVENILE EXPERIENCES WENT FOR LITTLE OR NOTHING THEN AND THAT LIFE WAS MORE LIKE A GREAT FAIRY STORY WHICH I WAS JUST ABOUT TO BEGIN TO READ THAN ANYTHING ELSE MY AUNT AND I HAD HELD MANY GRAVE DELIBERATIONS ON THE CALLING TO WHICH I SHOULD BE DEVOTED FOR A YEAR OR MORE I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO FIND A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO HER OFTENREPEATED QUESTION WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE BUT I HAD NO PARTICULAR LIKING THAT I COULD DISCOVER FOR ANYTHING IF I COULD HAVE BEEN INSPIRED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCIENCE OF NAVIGATION TAKEN THE COMMAND OF A FASTSAILING EXPEDITION AND GONE ROUND THE WORLD ON A TRIUMPHANT VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY I THINK I MIGHT HAVE CONSIDERED MYSELF COMPLETELY SUITED BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY SUCH MIRACULOUS PROVISION MY DESIRE WAS TO APPLY MYSELF TO SOME PURSUIT THAT WOULD NOT LIE TOO HEAVILY UPON HER PURSE AND TO DO MY DUTY IN IT WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE MR DICK HAD REGULARLY ASSISTED AT OUR COUNCILS WITH A MEDITATIVE AND SAGE DEMEANOUR HE NEVER MADE A SUGGESTION BUT ONCE AND ON THAT OCCASION I DONT KNOW WHAT PUT IT IN HIS HEAD HE SUDDENLY PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD BE A BRAZIER MY AUNT RECEIVED THIS PROPOSAL SO VERY UNGRACIOUSLY THAT HE NEVER VENTURED ON A SECOND BUT EVER AFTERWARDS CONFINED HIMSELF TO LOOKING WATCHFULLY AT HER FOR HER SUGGESTIONS AND RATTLING HIS MONEY TROT I TELL YOU WHAT MY DEAR SAID MY AUNT ONE MORNING IN THE CHRISTMAS SEASON WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL AS THIS KNOTTY POINT IS STILL UNSETTLED AND AS WE MUST NOT MAKE A MISTAKE IN OUR DECISION IF WE CAN HELP IT I THINK WE HAD BETTER TAKE A LITTLE BREATHINGTIME IN THE MEANWHILE YOU MUST TRY TO LOOK AT IT FROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW AND NOT AS A SCHOOLBOY I WILL AUNT IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME PURSUED MY AUNT THAT A LITTLE CHANGE AND A GLIMPSE OF LIFE OUT OF DOORS MAY BE USEFUL IN HELPING YOU TO KNOW YOUR OWN MIND AND FORM A COOLER JUDGEMENT SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO GO DOWN INTO THE OLD PART OF THE COUNTRY AGAIN FOR INSTANCE AND SEE THATTHAT OUTOFTHEWAY WOMAN WITH THE SAVAGEST OF NAMES SAID MY AUNT RUBBING HER NOSE FOR SHE COULD NEVER THOROUGHLY FORGIVE PEGGOTTY FOR BEING SO CALLED OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD AUNT I SHOULD LIKE IT BEST WELL SAID MY AUNT THATS LUCKY FOR I SHOULD LIKE IT TOO BUT ITS NATURAL AND RATIONAL THAT YOU SHOULD LIKE IT AND I AM VERY WELL PERSUADED THAT WHATEVER YOU DO TROT WILL ALWAYS BE NATURAL AND RATIONAL I HOPE SO AUNT YOUR SISTER BETSEY TROTWOOD SAID MY AUNT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS NATURAL AND RATIONAL A GIRL AS EVER BREATHED YOULL BE

THAN ANYONE I HAVE EVER SEEN HERE MUST RISE UP BEFORE I GIVE MY CONSENT IN THE TIME TO COME I SHALL HAVE A WARY EYE ON ALL ADMIRERS AND SHALL EXACT A GREAT DEAL FROM THE SUCCESSFUL ONE I ASSURE YOU WE HAD GONE ON SO FAR IN A MIXTURE OF CONFIDENTIAL JEST AND EARNEST THAT HAD LONG GROWN NATURALLY OUT OF OUR FAMILIAR RELATIONS BEGUN AS MERE CHILDREN BUT AGNES NOW SUDDENLY LIFTING UP HER EYES TO MINE

REMARKED THAT AT THOSE TIMES AND WHEN HE IS LEAST LIKE HIMSELF HE IS MOST CERTAIN TO BE WANTED ON SOME BUSINESS BY URIAH SAID AGNES YES AND THE SENSE OF BEING UNFIT FOR IT OR OF NOT HAVING UNDERSTOOD IT OR OF HAVING SHOWN HIS CONDITION IN SPITE OF HIMSELF SEEMS TO MAKE HIM SO UNEASY THAT NEXT DAY HE IS WORSE AND NEXT DAY WORSE AND SO HE BECOMES JADED AND HAGGARD DO NOT BE ALARMED BY WHAT I SAY AGNES BUT IN THIS STATE I SAW HIM ONLY THE OTHER EVENING LAY DOWN HIS HEAD UPON HIS DESK AND SHED TEARS LIKE A CHILD HER HAND PASSED SOFTLY BEFORE MY LIPS WHILE I WAS YET SPEAKING AND IN A MOMENT SHE HAD MET HER FATHER AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM AND WAS HANGING ON HIS SHOULDER THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE AS THEY BOTH LOOKED TOWARDS ME I FELT TO BE VERY TOUCHING THERE WAS SUCH DEEP FONDNESS FOR HIM AND GRATITUDE TO HIM FOR ALL HIS LOVE AND CARE IN HER BEAUTIFUL LOOK AND THERE WAS SUCH A FERVENT APPEAL TO ME TO DEAL TENDERLY BY HIM EVEN IN MY INMOST THOUGHTS AND TO LET NO HARSH CONSTRUCTION FIND ANY PLACE AGAINST HIM SHE WAS AT ONCE SO PROUD OF HIM AND DEVOTED TO HIM YET SO COMPASSIONATE AND SORRY AND SO RELIANT UPON ME TO BE SO TOO THAT NOTHING SHE COULD HAVE SAID WOULD HAVE EXPRESSED MORE TO ME

EXPECTED OR LED UP TOTHAT SHE COULD ONLY TELL THE DOCTOR IT WAS LIKE HIMSELF AND GO SEVERAL TIMES THROUGH THAT OPERATION OF KISSING THE STICKS OF HER FAN AND THEN TAPPING HIS HAND WITH IT AFTER WHICH SHE GENTLY CHID HER DAUGHTER ANNIE FOR NOT BEING MORE DEMONSTRATIVE WHEN SUCH KINDNESSES WERE SHOWERED FOR HER SAKE ON HER OLD PLAYFELLOW AND ENTERTAINED US WITH SOME PARTICULARS CONCERNING OTHER DESERVING MEMBERS OF HER FAMILY WHOM IT WAS DESIRABLE TO SET ON THEIR DESERVING LEGS ALL THIS TIME HER DAUGHTER ANNIE NEVER ONCE SPOKE OR LIFTED UP HER EYES ALL THIS TIME MR WICKFIELD HAD HIS GLANCE UPON HER AS SHE SAT BY HIS OWN DAUGHTERS SIDE IT APPEARED TO ME THAT HE NEVER THOUGHT OF BEING OBSERVED BY ANYONE BUT WAS SO INTENT UPON HER AND UPON HIS OWN THOUGHTS IN CONNEXION WITH HER AS TO BE QUITE ABSORBED HE NOW ASKED WHAT MR JACK MALDON HAD ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN REFERENCE TO HIMSELF AND TO WHOM HE HAD WRITTEN WHY HERE SAID MRS MARKLEHAM TAKING A LETTER FROM THE CHIMNEYPIECE ABOVE THE DOCTORS HEAD THE DEAR FELLOW SAYS TO THE DOCTOR HIMSELFWHERE IS IT OHI AM SORRY TO INFORM YOU THAT MY HEALTH IS SUFFERING SEVERELY AND THAT I FEAR I MAY BE REDUCED TO THE NECESSITY OF RETURNING HOME FOR A TIME AS THE ONLY HOPE OF RESTORATION THATS PRETTY PLAIN POOR FELLOW HIS ONLY HOPE OF RESTORATION BUT ANNIES LETTER IS PLAINER STILL ANNIE SHOW ME THAT LETTER AGAIN NOT NOW MAMA SHE PLEADED IN A LOW TONE MY DEAR YOU ABSOLUTELY ARE ON SOME SUBJECTS ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS PERSONS IN THE WORLD RETURNED HER MOTHER AND PERHAPS THE MOST UNNATURAL TO THE CLAIMS OF YOUR OWN FAMILY WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE HEARD OF THE LETTER AT ALL I BELIEVE UNLESS I HAD ASKED FOR IT MYSELF DO YOU CALL THAT CONFIDENCE MY LOVE TOWARDS DOCTOR STRONG I AM SURPRISED YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER THE LETTER WAS RELUCTANTLY PRODUCED AND AS I HANDED IT TO THE OLD LADY I SAW HOW THE UNWILLING HAND FROM WHICH I TOOK IT TREMBLED NOW LET US SEE SAID MRS MARKLEHAM PUTTING HER GLASS TO HER EYE WHERE THE PASSAGE IS THE REMEMBRANCE OF OLD TIMES MY DEAREST ANNIEAND SO FORTHITS NOT THERE THE AMIABLE OLD PROCTORWHOS HE DEAR ME ANNIE HOW ILLEGIBLY YOUR COUSIN MALDON WRITES AND HOW STUPID I AM DOCTOR OF COURSE AH AMIABLE INDEED HERE SHE LEFT OFF TO KISS HER FAN AGAIN AND SHAKE IT AT THE DOCTOR WHO WAS LOOKING AT US IN A STATE OF PLACID SATISFACTION NOW I HAVE FOUND IT YOU MAY NOT BE SURPRISED TO HEAR ANNIENO TO BE SURE KNOWING THAT HE NEVER WAS REALLY STRONG WHAT DID I SAY JUST NOWTHAT I HAVE UNDERGONE SO MUCH IN THIS DISTANT PLACE AS TO HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE IT AT ALL HAZARDS ON SICK LEAVE IF I CAN ON TOTAL RESIGNATION IF THAT IS NOT TO BE OBTAINED WHAT I HAVE ENDURED AND DO ENDURE HERE IS INSUPPORTABLE AND BUT FOR THE PROMPTITUDE OF THAT BEST OF CREATURES SAID MRS MARKLEHAM TELEGRAPHING THE DOCTOR AS BEFORE AND REFOLDING THE LETTER IT WOULD BE INSUPPORTABLE TO ME TO THINK OF MR WICKFIELD SAID NOT ONE WORD THOUGH THE OLD LADY LOOKED TO HIM AS IF FOR HIS COMMENTARY ON THIS INTELLIGENCE BUT SAT SEVERELY SILENT WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND LONG AFTER THE SUBJECT WAS DISMISSED AND OTHER TOPICS OCCUPIED US HE REMAINED SO SELDOM RAISING HIS EYES UNLESS TO REST THEM FOR A MOMENT WITH A THOUGHTFUL FROWN UPON THE DOCTOR OR HIS WIFE OR BOTH THE DOCTOR WAS VERY FOND OF MUSIC AGNES SANG WITH GREAT SWEETNESS AND EXPRESSION AND SO DID MRS STRONG THEY SANG TOGETHER AND PLAYED DUETS TOGETHER AND WE HAD QUITE A LITTLE CONCERT BUT I REMARKED TWO THINGS FIRST THAT THOUGH ANNIE SOON RECOVERED HER COMPOSURE AND WAS QUITE HERSELF THERE WAS A BLANK BETWEEN HER AND MR WICKFIELD WHICH SEPARATED THEM WHOLLY FROM EACH OTHER SECONDLY THAT MR WICKFIELD SEEMED TO DISLIKE THE INTIMACY BETWEEN HER AND AGNES AND TO WATCH IT WITH UNEASINESS AND NOW I MUST CONFESS THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT I HAD SEEN ON THAT NIGHT WHEN MR MALDON WENT AWAY FIRST BEGAN TO RETURN UPON ME WITH A MEANING IT HAD NEVER HAD AND TO TROUBLE ME THE INNOCENT BEAUTY OF HER FACE WAS NOT AS INNOCENT TO ME AS IT HAD BEEN I MISTRUSTED THE NATURAL GRACE AND CHARM OF HER MANNER AND WHEN I LOOKED AT AGNES BY HER SIDE AND THOUGHT HOW GOOD AND TRUE AGNES WAS SUSPICIONS AROSE WITHIN ME THAT IT WAS AN ILLASSORTED FRIENDSHIP SHE WAS SO HAPPY IN IT HERSELF HOWEVER AND THE OTHER WAS SO HAPPY TOO THAT THEY MADE THE EVENING FLY AWAY AS IF IT WERE BUT AN HOUR IT CLOSED IN AN INCIDENT WHICH I WELL REMEMBER THEY WERE TAKING LEAVE OF EACH OTHER AND AGNES WAS GOING TO EMBRACE HER AND KISS HER WHEN MR WICKFIELD STEPPED BETWEEN THEM AS IF BY ACCIDENT AND DREW AGNES QUICKLY AWAY THEN I SAW AS THOUGH ALL THE INTERVENING TIME HAD BEEN CANCELLED AND I WERE STILL STANDING IN THE DOORWAY ON THE NIGHT OF THE DEPARTURE THE EXPRESSION OF THAT NIGHT IN THE FACE OF MRS STRONG AS IT CONFRONTED HIS I CANNOT SAY WHAT AN IMPRESSION THIS MADE UPON ME OR HOW IMPOSSIBLE I FOUND IT WHEN I THOUGHT OF HER AFTERWARDS TO SEPARATE HER FROM THIS LOOK AND REMEMBER HER FACE IN ITS INNOCENT LOVELINESS AGAIN IT HAUNTED ME WHEN I GOT HOME I SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT THE DOCTORS ROOF WITH A DARK CLOUD LOWERING ON IT THE REVERENCE THAT I HAD FOR HIS GREY HEAD WAS MINGLED WITH COMMISERATION FOR HIS FAITH IN THOSE WHO WERE TREACHEROUS TO HIM AND WITH RESENTMENT AGAINST THOSE WHO INJURED HIM THE IMPENDING SHADOW OF A GREAT AFFLICTION AND A GREAT DISGRACE THAT HAD NO DISTINCT FORM IN IT YET FELL LIKE A STAIN UPON THE QUIET PLACE WHERE I HAD WORKED AND PLAYED AS A BOY AND DID IT A CRUEL WRONG I HAD NO PLEASURE IN THINKING ANY MORE OF THE GRAVE OLD BROADLEAVED ALOETREES WHICH REMAINED SHUT UP IN THEMSELVES A HUNDRED YEARS TOGETHER AND OF THE TRIM SMOOTH GRASSPLOT AND THE STONE URNS AND THE DOCTORS WALK AND THE CONGENIAL SOUND OF THE CATHEDRAL BELL HOVERING ABOVE THEM ALL IT WAS AS IF THE TRANQUIL SANCTUARY OF MY BOYHOOD HAD BEEN SACKED BEFORE MY FACE AND ITS PEACE AND HONOUR GIVEN TO THE WINDS BUT MORNING BROUGHT WITH IT MY PARTING FROM THE OLD HOUSE WHICH AGNES HAD FILLED WITH HER INFLUENCE AND THAT OCCUPIED MY MIND SUFFICIENTLY I SHOULD BE THERE AGAIN SOON NO DOUBT I MIGHT SLEEP AGAINPERHAPS OFTENIN MY OLD ROOM BUT THE DAYS OF MY INHABITING THERE WERE GONE AND THE OLD TIME WAS PAST I WAS HEAVIER AT HEART WHEN I PACKED UP SUCH OF MY BOOKS AND CLOTHES AS STILL REMAINED THERE TO BE SENT TO DOVER THAN I CARED TO SHOW TO URIAH HEEP WHO WAS SO OFFICIOUS TO HELP ME THAT I UNCHARITABLY THOUGHT HIM MIGHTY GLAD THAT I WAS GOING I GOT AWAY FROM AGNES AND HER FATHER SOMEHOW WITH AN INDIFFERENT SHOW OF BEING VERY MANLY AND TOOK MY SEAT UPON THE BOX OF THE LONDON COACH I WAS SO SOFTENED AND FORGIVING GOING THROUGH THE TOWN THAT I HAD HALF A MIND TO NOD TO MY OLD ENEMY THE BUTCHER AND THROW HIM FIVE SHILLINGS TO DRINK BUT HE LOOKED SUCH A VERY OBDURATE BUTCHER AS HE STOOD SCRAPING THE GREAT BLOCK IN THE SHOP AND MOREOVER HIS APPEARANCE WAS SO LITTLE IMPROVED BY THE LOSS OF A FRONT TOOTH WHICH I HAD KNOCKED OUT THAT I THOUGHT IT BEST TO MAKE NO ADVANCES THE MAIN OBJECT ON MY MIND I REMEMBER WHEN WE GOT FAIRLY ON THE ROAD WAS TO APPEAR AS OLD AS POSSIBLE TO THE COACHMAN AND TO SPEAK EXTREMELY GRUFF THE LATTER POINT I ACHIEVED AT GREAT PERSONAL INCONVENIENCE BUT I STUCK TO IT BECAUSE I FELT IT WAS A GROWNUP SORT OF THING YOU ARE GOING THROUGH SIR SAID THE COACHMAN YES WILLIAM I SAID CONDESCENDINGLY I KNEW HIM I AM GOING TO LONDON I SHALL GO DOWN INTO SUFFOLK AFTERWARDS SHOOTING SIR SAID THE COACHMAN HE KNEW AS WELL AS I DID THAT IT WAS JUST AS LIKELY AT THAT TIME OF YEAR I WAS GOING DOWN THERE WHALING BUT I FELT COMPLIMENTED TOO I DONT KNOW I SAID PRETENDING TO BE UNDECIDED WHETHER I SHALL TAKE A SHOT OR NOT BIRDS IS GOT WERY SHY IM TOLD SAID WILLIAM SO I UNDERSTAND SAID I IS SUFFOLK YOUR COUNTY SIR ASKED WILLIAM YES I SAID WITH SOME IMPORTANCE SUFFOLKS MY COUNTY IM TOLD THE DUMPLINGS IS UNCOMMON FINE DOWN THERE SAID WILLIAM I WAS NOT AWARE OF IT MYSELF BUT I FELT IT NECESSARY TO UPHOLD THE INSTITUTIONS OF MY COUNTY AND TO EVINCE A FAMILIARITY WITH THEM SO I SHOOK MY HEAD AS MUCH AS TO SAY I BELIEVE YOU AND THE PUNCHES SAID WILLIAM THERES CATTLE A SUFFOLK PUNCH WHEN HES A GOOD UN IS WORTH HIS WEIGHT IN GOLD DID YOU EVER BREED ANY SUFFOLK PUNCHES YOURSELF SIR NNO I SAID NOT EXACTLY HERES A GENLMN BEHIND ME ILL POUND IT SAID WILLIAM AS HAS BRED EM BY WHOLESALE THE GENTLEMAN SPOKEN OF WAS A GENTLEMAN WITH A VERY UNPROMISING SQUINT AND A PROMINENT CHIN WHO HAD A TALL WHITE HAT ON WITH A NARROW FLAT BRIM AND WHOSE CLOSEFITTING DRAB TROUSERS SEEMED TO BUTTON ALL THE WAY UP OUTSIDE HIS LEGS FROM HIS BOOTS TO HIS HIPS HIS CHIN WAS COCKED OVER THE COACHMANS SHOULDER SO NEAR TO ME THAT HIS BREATH QUITE TICKLED THE BACK OF MY HEAD AND AS I LOOKED AT HIM HE LEERED AT THE LEADERS WITH THE EYE WITH WHICH HE DIDNT SQUINT IN A VERY KNOWING MANNER AINT YOU ASKED WILLIAM AINT I WHAT SAID THE GENTLEMAN BEHIND BRED THEM SUFFOLK PUNCHES BY WHOLESALE I SHOULD THINK SO SAID THE GENTLEMAN THERE AINT NO SORT OF ORSE THAT I AINT BRED AND NO SORT OF DORG ORSES AND DORGS IS SOME MENS FANCY THEYRE WITTLES AND

THE REINS I CONSTRUED THIS REMARK INTO AN INDICATION OF A WISH THAT HE SHOULD HAVE MY PLACE SO I BLUSHINGLY OFFERED TO RESIGN IT WELL IF YOU DONT MIND SIR SAID WILLIAM I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE CORRECT I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED THIS AS THE FIRST FALL I HAD IN LIFE WHEN I BOOKED MY PLACE AT THE COACH OFFICE I HAD HAD BOX SEAT WRITTEN AGAINST THE ENTRY AND HAD GIVEN THE BOOKKEEPER HALFACROWN I WAS GOT UP IN A SPECIAL GREATCOAT AND SHAWL EXPRESSLY TO DO HONOUR TO THAT DISTINGUISHED EMINENCE HAD GLORIFIED MYSELF UPON IT A GOOD DEAL AND HAD FELT THAT I WAS A CREDIT TO THE COACH AND HERE IN THE VERY FIRST STAGE I WAS SUPPLANTED BY A SHABBY MAN WITH A SQUINT WHO HAD NO OTHER MERIT THAN SMELLING LIKE A LIVERYSTABLES AND BEING ABLE TO WALK ACROSS ME MORE LIKE A FLY THAN A HUMAN BEING WHILE THE HORSES WERE AT A CANTER A DISTRUST OF MYSELF WHICH HAS OFTEN BESET ME IN LIFE ON SMALL OCCASIONS WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AWAY WAS ASSUREDLY NOT STOPPED IN ITS GROWTH BY THIS LITTLE INCIDENT OUTSIDE THE CANTERBURY COACH IT WAS IN VAIN TO TAKE REFUGE IN GRUFFNESS OF SPEECH I SPOKE FROM THE PIT OF MY STOMACH FOR THE REST OF THE JOURNEY BUT I FELT COMPLETELY EXTINGUISHED AND DREADFULLY YOUNG IT WAS CURIOUS AND INTERESTING NEVERTHELESS TO BE SITTING UP THERE BEHIND FOUR HORSES WELL EDUCATED WELL DRESSED AND WITH PLENTY OF MONEY IN MY POCKET AND TO LOOK OUT FOR THE PLACES WHERE I HAD SLEPT ON MY WEARY JOURNEY I HAD ABUNDANT OCCUPATION FOR MY THOUGHTS IN EVERY CONSPICUOUS LANDMARK ON THE ROAD WHEN I LOOKED DOWN AT THE TRAMPERS WHOM WE PASSED AND SAW THAT WELLREMEMBERED STYLE OF FACE TURNED UP I FELT AS IF THE TINKERS BLACKENED HAND WERE IN THE BOSOM OF MY SHIRT AGAIN WHEN WE CLATTERED THROUGH THE NARROW STREET OF CHATHAM AND I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE IN PASSING OF THE LANE WHERE THE OLD MONSTER LIVED WHO HAD BOUGHT MY JACKET I STRETCHED MY NECK EAGERLY TO LOOK FOR THE PLACE WHERE I HAD SAT IN THE SUN AND IN THE SHADE WAITING FOR MY MONEY WHEN WE CAME AT LAST WITHIN A STAGE OF LONDON AND PASSED THE VERITABLE SALEM HOUSE WHERE MR CREAKLE HAD LAID ABOUT HIM WITH A HEAVY HAND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL I HAD FOR LAWFUL PERMISSION TO GET DOWN AND THRASH HIM AND LET ALL THE BOYS OUT LIKE SO MANY CAGED SPARROWS WE WENT TO THE GOLDEN CROSS AT CHARING CROSS THEN A MOULDY SORT OF ESTABLISHMENT IN A CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD A WAITER SHOWED ME INTO THE COFFEEROOM AND A CHAMBERMAID INTRODUCED ME TO MY SMALL BEDCHAMBER WHICH SMELT LIKE A HACKNEYCOACH AND WAS SHUT UP LIKE A FAMILY VAULT I WAS STILL PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF MY YOUTH FOR NOBODY STOOD IN ANY AWE OF ME AT ALL THE CHAMBERMAID BEING UTTERLY INDIFFERENT TO MY OPINIONS ON ANY SUBJECT AND THE WAITER BEING FAMILIAR WITH ME AND OFFERING ADVICE TO MY INEXPERIENCE WELL NOW SAID THE WAITER IN A TONE OF CONFIDENCE WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FOR DINNER YOUNG GENTLEMEN LIKES POULTRY IN GENERAL HAVE A FOWL I TOLD HIM AS MAJESTICALLY AS I COULD THAT I WASNT IN THE HUMOUR FOR A FOWL AINT YOU SAID THE WAITER YOUNG GENTLEMEN IS GENERALLY TIRED OF BEEF AND MUTTON HAVE A WEAL CUTLET I ASSENTED TO THIS PROPOSAL IN DEFAULT OF BEING ABLE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING ELSE DO YOU CARE FOR TATERS SAID THE WAITER WITH AN INSINUATING SMILE AND HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE YOUNG GENTLEMEN GENERALLY HAS BEEN OVERDOSED WITH TATERS I COMMANDED HIM IN MY DEEPEST VOICE TO ORDER A VEAL CUTLET AND POTATOES AND ALL THINGS FITTING AND TO INQUIRE AT THE BAR IF THERE WERE ANY LETTERS FOR TROTWOOD COPPERFIELD ESQUIREWHICH I KNEW THERE WERE NOT AND COULDNT BE BUT THOUGHT IT MANLY TO APPEAR TO EXPECT HE SOON CAME BACK TO SAY THAT THERE WERE NONE AT WHICH I WAS MUCH SURPRISED AND BEGAN TO LAY THE CLOTH FOR MY DINNER IN A BOX BY THE FIRE WHILE HE WAS SO ENGAGED HE ASKED ME WHAT I WOULD TAKE WITH IT AND ON MY REPLYING HALF A PINT OF SHERRY THOUGHT IT A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY I AM AFRAID TO EXTRACT THAT MEASURE OF WINE FROM THE STALE LEAVINGS AT THE BOTTOMS OF SEVERAL SMALL DECANTERS I AM OF THIS OPINION BECAUSE WHILE I WAS READING THE NEWSPAPER I OBSERVED HIM BEHIND A LOW WOODEN PARTITION WHICH WAS HIS PRIVATE APARTMENT VERY BUSY POURING OUT OF A NUMBER OF THOSE VESSELS INTO ONE LIKE A CHEMIST AND DRUGGIST MAKING UP A PRESCRIPTION WHEN THE WINE CAME TOO I THOUGHT IT FLAT AND IT CERTAINLY HAD MORE ENGLISH CRUMBS IN IT THAN WERE TO BE EXPECTED IN A FOREIGN WINE IN ANYTHING LIKE A PURE STATE BUT I WAS BASHFUL ENOUGH TO DRINK IT AND SAY NOTHING BEING THEN IN A PLEASANT FRAME OF MIND FROM WHICH I INFER THAT POISONING IS NOT ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE IN SOME STAGES OF THE PROCESS I RESOLVED TO GO TO THE PLAY IT WAS COVENT GARDEN THEATRE THAT I CHOSE AND THERE FROM THE BACK OF A CENTRE BOX I SAW JULIUS CAESAR AND THE NEW PANTOMIME TO HAVE ALL THOSE NOBLE ROMANS ALIVE BEFORE ME AND WALKING IN AND OUT FOR MY ENTERTAINMENT INSTEAD OF BEING THE STERN TASKMASTERS THEY HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL WAS A MOST NOVEL AND DELIGHTFUL EFFECT BUT THE MINGLED REALITY AND MYSTERY OF THE WHOLE SHOW THE INFLUENCE UPON ME OF THE POETRY THE LIGHTS THE MUSIC THE COMPANY THE SMOOTH STUPENDOUS CHANGES OF GLITTERING AND BRILLIANT SCENERY WERE SO DAZZLING AND OPENED UP SUCH ILLIMITABLE REGIONS OF DELIGHT THAT WHEN I CAME OUT INTO THE RAINY STREET AT TWELVE OCLOCK AT NIGHT I FELT AS IF I HAD COME FROM THE CLOUDS WHERE I HAD BEEN LEADING A ROMANTIC LIFE FOR AGES TO A BAWLING SPLASHING LINKLIGHTED UMBRELLASTRUGGLING HACKNEYCOACHJOSTLING PATTENCLINKING MUDDY MISERABLE WORLD I HAD EMERGED BY ANOTHER DOOR AND STOOD IN THE STREET FOR A LITTLE WHILE AS IF I REALLY WERE A STRANGER UPON EARTH BUT THE UNCEREMONIOUS PUSHING AND HUSTLING THAT I RECEIVED SOON RECALLED ME TO MYSELF AND PUT ME IN THE ROAD BACK TO THE HOTEL WHITHER I WENT REVOLVING THE GLORIOUS VISION ALL THE WAY AND WHERE AFTER SOME PORTER AND OYSTERS I SAT REVOLVING IT STILL AT PAST ONE OCLOCK WITH MY EYES ON THE COFFEEROOM FIRE I WAS SO FILLED WITH THE PLAY AND WITH THE PASTFOR IT WAS IN A MANNER LIKE A SHINING TRANSPARENCY THROUGH WHICH I SAW MY EARLIER LIFE MOVING ALONGTHAT I DONT KNOW WHEN THE FIGURE OF A HANDSOME WELLFORMED YOUNG MAN DRESSED WITH A TASTEFUL EASY NEGLIGENCE WHICH I HAVE REASON TO REMEMBER VERY WELL BECAME A REAL PRESENCE TO ME BUT I RECOLLECT BEING CONSCIOUS OF HIS COMPANY WITHOUT HAVING NOTICED HIS COMING INAND MY STILL SITTING MUSING OVER THE COFFEEROOM FIRE AT LAST I ROSE TO GO TO BED MUCH TO THE RELIEF OF THE SLEEPY WAITER WHO HAD GOT THE FIDGETS IN HIS LEGS AND WAS TWISTING THEM AND HITTING THEM AND PUTTING THEM THROUGH ALL KINDS OF CONTORTIONS IN HIS SMALL PANTRY IN GOING TOWARDS THE DOOR I PASSED THE PERSON WHO HAD COME IN AND SAW HIM PLAINLY I TURNED DIRECTLY CAME BACK AND LOOKED AGAIN HE DID NOT KNOW ME BUT I KNEW HIM IN A MOMENT AT ANOTHER TIME I MIGHT HAVE WANTED THE CONFIDENCE OR THE DECISION TO SPEAK TO HIM AND MIGHT HAVE PUT IT OFF UNTIL NEXT DAY AND MIGHT HAVE LOST HIM BUT IN THE THEN CONDITION OF MY MIND WHERE THE PLAY WAS STILL RUNNING HIGH HIS FORMER PROTECTION OF ME APPEARED SO DESERVING OF MY GRATITUDE AND MY OLD LOVE FOR HIM OVERFLOWED MY BREAST SO FRESHLY AND SPONTANEOUSLY THAT I WENT UP TO HIM AT ONCE WITH A FASTBEATING HEART AND SAID STEERFORTH WONT YOU SPEAK TO ME HE LOOKED AT MEJUST AS HE USED TO LOOK SOMETIMESBUT I SAW NO RECOGNITION IN HIS FACE YOU DONT REMEMBER ME I AM AFRAID SAID I MY GOD HE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED ITS LITTLE COPPERFIELD I GRASPED HIM BY BOTH HANDS AND COULD NOT LET THEM GO BUT FOR VERY SHAME AND THE FEAR THAT IT MIGHT DISPLEASE HIM I COULD HAVE HELD HIM ROUND THE NECK AND CRIED I NEVER NEVER NEVER WAS SO GLAD MY DEAR STEERFORTH I AM SO OVERJOYED TO SEE YOU AND I AM REJOICED TO SEE YOU TOO HE SAID SHAKING MY HANDS HEARTILY WHY COPPERFIELD OLD BOY DONT BE OVERPOWERED AND YET HE WAS GLAD TOO I THOUGHT TO SEE HOW THE DELIGHT I HAD IN MEETING HIM AFFECTED ME I BRUSHED AWAY THE TEARS THAT MY UTMOST RESOLUTION HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP BACK AND I MADE A CLUMSY LAUGH OF IT AND WE SAT DOWN TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE WHY HOW DO YOU COME TO BE HERE SAID STEERFORTH CLAPPING ME ON THE SHOULDER I CAME HERE

HERE AMONG PILLOWS ENOUGH FOR SIX I SOON FELL ASLEEP IN A BLISSFUL CONDITION AND DREAMED OF ANCIENT ROME STEERFORTH AND FRIENDSHIP UNTIL THE EARLY MORNING COACHES RUMBLING OUT OF THE ARCHWAY UNDERNEATH MADE ME DREAM OF THUNDER AND THE GODS CHAPTER STEERFORTHS HOME WHEN THE CHAMBERMAID TAPPED AT MY DOOR AT EIGHT OCLOCK AND INFORMED ME THAT MY SHAVINGWATER WAS OUTSIDE I FELT SEVERELY THE HAVING NO OCCASION FOR IT AND BLUSHED IN MY BED THE SUSPICION THAT SHE LAUGHED TOO WHEN SHE SAID IT PREYED UPON MY MIND ALL THE TIME I WAS DRESSING AND GAVE ME I WAS CONSCIOUS A SNEAKING AND GUILTY AIR WHEN I PASSED HER ON THE STAIRCASE AS I WAS GOING DOWN TO BREAKFAST I WAS SO SENSITIVELY AWARE INDEED OF BEING YOUNGER THAN I COULD HAVE WISHED THAT FOR SOME TIME I COULD NOT MAKE UP MY MIND TO PASS HER AT ALL UNDER THE IGNOBLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE BUT HEARING HER THERE WITH A BROOM STOOD PEEPING OUT OF WINDOW AT KING CHARLES ON HORSEBACK SURROUNDED BY A MAZE OF HACKNEYCOACHES AND LOOKING ANYTHING BUT REGAL IN A DRIZZLING RAIN AND A DARKBROWN FOG UNTIL I WAS ADMONISHED BY THE WAITER THAT THE GENTLEMAN WAS WAITING FOR ME IT WAS NOT IN THE COFFEEROOM THAT I FOUND STEERFORTH EXPECTING ME BUT IN A SNUG PRIVATE APARTMENT REDCURTAINED AND TURKEYCARPETED WHERE THE FIRE BURNT BRIGHT AND A FINE HOT BREAKFAST WAS SET FORTH ON A TABLE COVERED WITH A CLEAN CLOTH AND A CHEERFUL MINIATURE OF THE ROOM THE FIRE THE BREAKFAST STEERFORTH AND ALL WAS SHINING IN THE LITTLE ROUND MIRROR OVER THE SIDEBOARD I WAS RATHER BASHFUL AT FIRST STEERFORTH BEING SO SELFPOSSESSED AND ELEGANT AND SUPERIOR TO ME IN ALL RESPECTS AGE INCLUDED BUT HIS EASY PATRONAGE SOON PUT THAT TO RIGHTS AND MADE ME QUITE AT HOME I COULD NOT ENOUGH ADMIRE THE CHANGE HE HAD WROUGHT IN THE GOLDEN CROSS OR COMPARE THE DULL FORLORN STATE I HAD HELD YESTERDAY WITH THIS MORNINGS COMFORT AND THIS MORNINGS ENTERTAINMENT AS TO THE WAITERS FAMILIARITY IT WAS QUENCHED AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN HE ATTENDED ON US AS I MAY SAY IN SACKCLOTH AND ASHES NOW COPPERFIELD SAID STEERFORTH WHEN WE WERE ALONE I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WHERE YOU ARE GOING AND ALL ABOUT YOU I FEEL AS IF YOU WERE MY PROPERTY GLOWING WITH PLEASURE TO FIND THAT HE HAD STILL THIS INTEREST IN ME I TOLD HIM HOW MY AUNT HAD PROPOSED THE LITTLE EXPEDITION THAT I HAD BEFORE ME AND WHITHER IT TENDED AS YOU ARE IN NO HURRY THEN SAID STEERFORTH COME HOME WITH ME TO HIGHGATE AND STAY A DAY OR TWO YOU WILL BE PLEASED WITH MY MOTHERSHE IS A LITTLE VAIN AND PROSY ABOUT ME BUT THAT YOU CAN FORGIVE HERAND SHE WILL BE PLEASED WITH YOU I SHOULD LIKE TO BE AS SURE OF THAT AS YOU ARE KIND ENOUGH TO SAY YOU ARE I ANSWERED SMILING OH SAID STEERFORTH EVERYONE WHO LIKES ME HAS A CLAIM ON HER THAT IS SURE TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED THEN I THINK I SHALL BE A FAVOURITE SAID I GOOD SAID STEERFORTH COME AND PROVE IT WE WILL GO AND SEE THE LIONS FOR AN HOUR OR TWOITS SOMETHING TO HAVE A FRESH FELLOW LIKE YOU TO SHOW THEM TO COPPERFIELDAND THEN WELL JOURNEY OUT TO HIGHGATE BY THE COACH I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE BUT THAT I WAS IN A DREAM AND THAT I SHOULD WAKE PRESENTLY IN NUMBER FORTYFOUR TO THE SOLITARY BOX IN THE COFFEEROOM AND THE FAMILIAR WAITER AGAIN AFTER I HAD WRITTEN TO MY AUNT AND TOLD HER OF MY FORTUNATE MEETING WITH MY ADMIRED OLD SCHOOLFELLOW AND MY ACCEPTANCE OF HIS INVITATION WE WENT OUT IN A HACKNEYCHARIOT AND SAW A PANORAMA AND SOME OTHER SIGHTS AND TOOK A WALK THROUGH THE MUSEUM WHERE I COULD NOT HELP OBSERVING HOW MUCH STEERFORTH KNEW ON AN INFINITE VARIETY OF SUBJECTS AND OF HOW LITTLE ACCOUNT HE SEEMED TO MAKE HIS KNOWLEDGE YOULL TAKE A HIGH DEGREE AT COLLEGE STEERFORTH SAID I IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE SO ALREADY AND THEY WILL HAVE GOOD REASON TO BE PROUD OF YOU I TAKE A DEGREE CRIED STEERFORTH NOT I MY DEAR DAISYWILL YOU MIND MY CALLING YOU DAISY NOT AT ALL SAID I THATS A GOOD FELLOW MY DEAR DAISY SAID STEERFORTH LAUGHING I HAVE NOT THE LEAST DESIRE OR INTENTION TO DISTINGUISH MYSELF IN THAT WAY I HAVE DONE QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR MY PURPOSE I FIND THAT I AM HEAVY COMPANY ENOUGH FOR MYSELF AS I AM BUT THE FAME I WAS BEGINNING YOU ROMANTIC DAISY SAID STEERFORTH LAUGHING STILL MORE HEARTILY WHY SHOULD I TROUBLE MYSELF THAT A PARCEL OF HEAVYHEADED FELLOWS MAY GAPE AND HOLD UP THEIR HANDS LET THEM DO IT AT SOME OTHER MAN THERES FAME FOR HIM AND HES WELCOME TO IT I WAS ABASHED AT HAVING MADE SO GREAT A MISTAKE AND WAS GLAD TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT FORTUNATELY IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO DO FOR STEERFORTH COULD ALWAYS PASS FROM ONE SUBJECT TO ANOTHER WITH A CARELESSNESS AND LIGHTNESS THAT WERE HIS OWN LUNCH SUCCEEDED TO OUR SIGHTSEEING AND THE SHORT WINTER DAY WORE AWAY SO FAST THAT IT WAS DUSK WHEN THE STAGECOACH STOPPED WITH US AT AN OLD BRICK HOUSE AT HIGHGATE ON THE SUMMIT OF THE HILL AN ELDERLY LADY THOUGH NOT VERY FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS WITH A PROUD CARRIAGE AND A HANDSOME FACE WAS IN THE DOORWAY AS WE ALIGHTED AND GREETING STEERFORTH AS MY DEAREST JAMES FOLDED HIM IN HER ARMS TO THIS LADY HE PRESENTED ME AS HIS MOTHER AND SHE GAVE ME A STATELY WELCOME IT WAS A GENTEEL OLDFASHIONED HOUSE VERY QUIET AND ORDERLY FROM THE WINDOWS OF MY ROOM I SAW ALL LONDON LYING IN THE DISTANCE LIKE A GREAT VAPOUR WITH HERE AND THERE SOME LIGHTS TWINKLING THROUGH IT I HAD ONLY TIME IN DRESSING TO GLANCE AT THE SOLID FURNITURE THE FRAMED PIECES OF WORK DONE I SUPPOSED BY STEERFORTHS MOTHER WHEN SHE WAS A GIRL AND SOME PICTURES IN CRAYONS OF LADIES WITH POWDERED HAIR AND BODICES COMING AND GOING ON THE WALLS AS THE NEWLYKINDLED FIRE CRACKLED AND SPUTTERED WHEN I WAS CALLED TO DINNER THERE WAS A SECOND LADY IN THE DININGROOM OF A SLIGHT SHORT FIGURE DARK AND NOT AGREEABLE TO LOOK AT BUT WITH SOME APPEARANCE OF GOOD LOOKS TOO WHO ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION PERHAPS BECAUSE I HAD NOT EXPECTED TO SEE HER PERHAPS BECAUSE I FOUND MYSELF SITTING OPPOSITE TO HER PERHAPS BECAUSE OF SOMETHING REALLY REMARKABLE IN HER SHE HAD BLACK HAIR AND EAGER BLACK EYES AND WAS THIN AND HAD A SCAR UPON HER LIP IT WAS AN OLD SCARI SHOULD RATHER CALL IT SEAM FOR IT WAS NOT DISCOLOURED AND HAD HEALED YEARS AGOWHICH HAD ONCE CUT THROUGH HER MOUTH DOWNWARD TOWARDS THE CHIN BUT WAS NOW BARELY VISIBLE ACROSS THE TABLE EXCEPT ABOVE AND ON HER UPPER LIP THE SHAPE OF WHICH IT HAD ALTERED I CONCLUDED IN MY OWN MIND THAT SHE WAS ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE AND THAT SHE WISHED TO BE MARRIED SHE WAS A LITTLE DILAPIDATEDLIKE A HOUSEWITH HAVING BEEN SO LONG TO LET YET HAD AS I HAVE SAID AN APPEARANCE OF GOOD LOOKS HER THINNESS SEEMED TO BE THE EFFECT OF SOME WASTING FIRE WITHIN HER WHICH FOUND A VENT IN HER GAUNT EYES SHE WAS INTRODUCED AS MISS DARTLE AND BOTH STEERFORTH AND HIS MOTHER CALLED HER ROSA I FOUND THAT SHE LIVED THERE AND HAD BEEN FOR A LONG TIME MRS STEERFORTHS COMPANION IT APPEARED TO ME THAT SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING SHE WANTED TO SAY OUTRIGHT BUT HINTED IT AND MADE A GREAT DEAL MORE OF IT BY THIS PRACTICE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN MRS STEERFORTH OBSERVED MORE IN JEST THAN EARNEST THAT SHE FEARED HER SON LED BUT A WILD LIFE AT COLLEGE MISS DARTLE PUT IN THUS OH REALLY YOU KNOW HOW IGNORANT I AM AND THAT I ONLY ASK FOR INFORMATION BUT ISNT IT ALWAYS SO I THOUGHT THAT KIND OF LIFE WAS ON ALL HANDS UNDERSTOOD TO BEEH IT IS EDUCATION FOR A VERY GRAVE PROFESSION IF YOU MEAN THAT ROSA MRS STEERFORTH ANSWERED WITH SOME COLDNESS OH YES THATS VERY TRUE RETURNED MISS DARTLE BUT ISNT IT THOUGHI WANT TO BE PUT RIGHT IF I AM WRONGISNT IT REALLY REALLY WHAT SAID MRS STEERFORTH OH YOU MEAN ITS NOT RETURNED MISS DARTLE WELL IM VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT NOW I KNOW WHAT TO DO THATS THE ADVANTAGE OF ASKING I SHALL NEVER ALLOW PEOPLE TO TALK BEFORE ME ABOUT WASTEFULNESS AND PROFLIGACY AND SO FORTH IN CONNEXION WITH THAT LIFE ANY MORE AND YOU WILL BE RIGHT SAID MRS STEERFORTH MY SONS TUTOR IS A CONSCIENTIOUS GENTLEMAN AND IF I HAD NOT IMPLICIT RELIANCE ON MY SON I SHOULD HAVE RELIANCE ON HIM SHOULD YOU SAID MISS DARTLE DEAR ME CONSCIENTIOUS IS HE REALLY CONSCIENTIOUS NOW YES I AM CONVINCED OF IT SAID MRS STEERFORTH HOW VERY NICE EXCLAIMED MISS DARTLE WHAT A COMFORT REALLY CONSCIENTIOUS THEN HES NOTBUT OF COURSE HE CANT BE IF HES REALLY CONSCIENTIOUS WELL I SHALL BE QUITE HAPPY IN MY OPINION OF HIM FROM THIS TIME YOU CANT THINK HOW IT ELEVATES HIM IN MY OPINION TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT HES REALLY CONSCIENTIOUS HER OWN VIEWS OF EVERY QUESTION AND HER CORRECTION OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID TO WHICH SHE WAS OPPOSED MISS DARTLE INSINUATED IN THE SAME WAY SOMETIMES I COULD NOT CONCEAL FROM MYSELF WITH GREAT POWER THOUGH IN CONTRADICTION EVEN OF STEERFORTH AN INSTANCE HAPPENED BEFORE DINNER WAS DONE MRS STEERFORTH SPEAKING TO ME ABOUT MY INTENTION OF GOING DOWN INTO SUFFOLK I SAID AT HAZARD HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF STEERFORTH WOULD ONLY GO THERE WITH ME AND EXPLAINING TO HIM THAT I WAS GOING TO SEE MY OLD NURSE AND MR PEGGOTTYS FAMILY I REMINDED HIM OF THE BOATMAN WHOM HE HAD SEEN AT SCHOOL OH THAT BLUFF FELLOW SAID STEERFORTH HE HAD A SON WITH HIM HADNT HE NO THAT WAS HIS NEPHEW I REPLIED WHOM HE ADOPTED THOUGH AS A SON HE HAS A VERY PRETTY LITTLE NIECE TOO WHOM HE ADOPTED AS A DAUGHTER IN SHORT HIS HOUSEOR RATHER HIS BOAT FOR HE LIVES IN ONE ON DRY LANDIS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OBJECTS OF HIS GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS YOU WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT HOUSEHOLD SHOULD I SAID STEERFORTH WELL I THINK I SHOULD I MUST SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE IT WOULD BE WORTH A JOURNEY NOT TO MENTION THE PLEASURE OF A JOURNEY WITH YOU DAISY TO SEE THAT SORT OF PEOPLE TOGETHER AND TO MAKE ONE OF EM MY HEART LEAPED WITH A NEW HOPE OF PLEASURE BUT IT WAS IN REFERENCE TO THE TONE IN WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN OF THAT SORT OF PEOPLE THAT MISS DARTLE WHOSE SPARKLING EYES HAD BEEN WATCHFUL OF US NOW BROKE IN AGAIN OH BUT REALLY DO TELL ME ARE THEY THOUGH SHE SAID ARE THEY WHAT AND ARE WHO WHAT SAID STEERFORTH THAT SORT OF PEOPLEARE THEY REALLY ANIMALS AND CLODS AND BEINGS OF ANOTHER ORDER I WANT TO KNOW SO MUCH WHY THERES A PRETTY WIDE SEPARATION BETWEEN THEM AND US SAID STEERFORTH WITH INDIFFERENCE THEY ARE NOT TO BE EXPECTED TO BE AS SENSITIVE AS WE ARE THEIR DELICACY IS NOT TO BE SHOCKED OR HURT EASILY THEY ARE WONDERFULLY VIRTUOUS I DARE SAYSOME PEOPLE CONTEND FOR THAT AT LEAST AND I AM SURE I DONT WANT TO CONTRADICT THEMBUT THEY HAVE NOT VERY FINE NATURES AND THEY MAY BE THANKFUL THAT LIKE THEIR COARSE ROUGH SKINS THEY ARE NOT EASILY WOUNDED REALLY SAID MISS DARTLE WELL I DONT KNOW NOW WHEN I HAVE BEEN BETTER PLEASED THAN TO HEAR THAT ITS SO CONSOLING ITS SUCH A DELIGHT TO KNOW THAT WHEN THEY SUFFER THEY DONT FEEL SOMETIMES I HAVE BEEN QUITE UNEASY FOR THAT SORT OF PEOPLE BUT NOW I SHALL JUST DISMISS THE IDEA OF THEM ALTOGETHER LIVE AND LEARN I HAD MY DOUBTS I CONFESS BUT NOW THEYRE CLEARED UP I DIDNT KNOW AND NOW I DO KNOW AND THAT SHOWS THE ADVANTAGE OF ASKINGDONT IT I BELIEVED THAT STEERFORTH HAD SAID WHAT HE HAD IN JEST OR TO DRAW MISS DARTLE OUT AND I EXPECTED HIM TO SAY AS MUCH WHEN SHE WAS GONE AND WE TWO WERE SITTING BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HE MERELY ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT OF HER SHE IS VERY CLEVER IS SHE NOT I ASKED CLEVER SHE BRINGS EVERYTHING TO A GRINDSTONE SAID STEERFORTH AND SHARPENS IT AS SHE HAS SHARPENED HER OWN FACE AND FIGURE THESE YEARS PAST SHE HAS WORN HERSELF AWAY BY CONSTANT SHARPENING SHE IS ALL EDGE WHAT A REMARKABLE SCAR THAT IS UPON HER LIP I SAID STEERFORTHS FACE FELL AND HE PAUSED A MOMENT WHY THE FACT IS HE RETURNED I DID THAT BY AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT NO I WAS A YOUNG BOY AND SHE EXASPERATED ME AND I THREW A HAMMER AT HER A PROMISING YOUNG ANGEL I MUST HAVE BEEN I WAS DEEPLY SORRY TO HAVE TOUCHED ON SUCH A PAINFUL THEME BUT THAT WAS USELESS NOW SHE HAS BORNE THE MARK EVER SINCE AS YOU SEE SAID STEERFORTH AND SHELL BEAR IT TO HER GRAVE IF SHE EVER RESTS IN ONETHOUGH I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE SHE WILL EVER REST ANYWHERE SHE WAS THE MOTHERLESS CHILD OF A SORT OF COUSIN OF MY FATHERS HE DIED ONE DAY MY MOTHER WHO WAS THEN A WIDOW BROUGHT HER HERE TO BE COMPANY TO HER SHE HAS A COUPLE OF THOUSAND POUNDS OF HER OWN AND SAVES THE INTEREST OF IT EVERY YEAR TO ADD TO THE PRINCIPAL THERES THE HISTORY OF MISS ROSA DARTLE FOR YOU AND I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE LOVES YOU LIKE A BROTHER SAID I HUMPH RETORTED STEERFORTH LOOKING AT THE FIRE SOME BROTHERS ARE NOT LOVED OVER MUCH AND SOME LOVEBUT HELP YOURSELF COPPERFIELD WELL DRINK THE DAISIES OF THE FIELD IN COMPLIMENT TO YOU AND THE LILIES OF THE VALLEY THAT TOIL NOT NEITHER DO THEY SPIN IN COMPLIMENT TO METHE MORE SHAME FOR ME A MOODY SMILE THAT HAD OVERSPREAD HIS FEATURES CLEARED OFF AS HE SAID THIS MERRILY AND HE WAS HIS OWN FRANK WINNING SELF AGAIN I COULD NOT HELP GLANCING AT THE SCAR WITH A PAINFUL INTEREST WHEN WE WENT IN TO TEA IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE I OBSERVED THAT IT WAS THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE PART OF HER FACE AND THAT WHEN SHE TURNED PALE THAT MARK ALTERED FIRST AND BECAME A DULL LEADCOLOURED STREAK LENGTHENING OUT TO ITS FULL EXTENT LIKE A MARK IN INVISIBLE INK BROUGHT TO THE FIRE THERE WAS A LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER AND STEERFORTH ABOUT A CAST OF THE DICE AT BACKGAMMONWHEN I THOUGHT HER FOR ONE MOMENT IN A STORM OF RAGE AND THEN I SAW IT START FORTH LIKE THE OLD WRITING ON THE WALL IT WAS NO MATTER OF WONDER TO ME TO FIND MRS STEERFORTH DEVOTED TO HER SON SHE SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK OR THINK ABOUT NOTHING ELSE SHE SHOWED ME HIS PICTURE AS AN INFANT IN A LOCKET WITH SOME OF HIS BABYHAIR IN IT SHE SHOWED ME HIS PICTURE AS HE HAD BEEN WHEN I FIRST KNEW HIM AND SHE WORE AT HER BREAST HIS PICTURE AS HE WAS NOW ALL THE LETTERS HE HAD EVER WRITTEN TO HER SHE KEPT IN A CABINET NEAR HER OWN CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SHE WOULD HAVE READ ME SOME OF THEM AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO HEAR THEM TOO IF HE HAD NOT INTERPOSED AND COAXED HER OUT OF THE DESIGN IT WAS AT MR CREAKLES MY SON TELLS ME THAT YOU FIRST BECAME ACQUAINTED SAID MRS STEERFORTH AS SHE AND I WERE TALKING AT ONE TABLE WHILE THEY PLAYED BACKGAMMON AT ANOTHER INDEED I RECOLLECT HIS SPEAKING AT THAT TIME OF A PUPIL YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF WHO HAD TAKEN HIS FANCY THERE BUT YOUR NAME AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE HAS NOT LIVED IN MY MEMORY HE WAS VERY GENEROUS AND NOBLE TO ME IN THOSE DAYS I ASSURE YOU MAAM SAID I AND I STOOD IN NEED OF SUCH A FRIEND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE CRUSHED WITHOUT HIM HE IS ALWAYS GENEROUS AND NOBLE SAID MRS STEERFORTH PROUDLY I SUBSCRIBED TO THIS WITH ALL MY HEART GOD KNOWS SHE KNEW I DID FOR THE STATELINESS OF HER MANNER ALREADY ABATED TOWARDS ME EXCEPT WHEN SHE SPOKE IN PRAISE OF HIM AND THEN HER AIR WAS ALWAYS LOFTY IT WAS NOT A FIT SCHOOL GENERALLY FOR MY SON SAID SHE FAR FROM IT BUT THERE WERE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE TIME OF MORE IMPORTANCE EVEN THAN THAT SELECTION MY SONS HIGH SPIRIT MADE IT DESIRABLE THAT HE SHOULD BE PLACED WITH SOME MAN WHO FELT ITS SUPERIORITY AND WOULD BE CONTENT TO BOW HIMSELF BEFORE IT AND WE FOUND SUCH A MAN THERE I KNEW THAT KNOWING THE FELLOW AND YET I DID NOT DESPISE HIM THE MORE FOR IT BUT THOUGHT IT A REDEEMING QUALITY IN HIM IF HE COULD BE ALLOWED ANY GRACE FOR NOT RESISTING ONE SO IRRESISTIBLE AS STEERFORTH MY SONS GREAT CAPACITY WAS TEMPTED ON THERE BY A FEELING OF VOLUNTARY EMULATION AND CONSCIOUS PRIDE THE FOND LADY WENT ON TO SAY HE WOULD HAVE RISEN AGAINST ALL CONSTRAINT BUT HE FOUND HIMSELF THE MONARCH OF THE PLACE AND HE HAUGHTILY DETERMINED TO BE WORTHY OF HIS STATION IT WAS LIKE HIMSELF I ECHOED WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL THAT IT WAS LIKE HIMSELF SO MY SON TOOK OF HIS OWN WILL AND ON NO COMPULSION TO THE COURSE IN WHICH HE CAN ALWAYS WHEN IT IS HIS PLEASURE OUTSTRIP EVERY COMPETITOR SHE PURSUED MY SON INFORMS ME MR COPPERFIELD THAT YOU WERE QUITE DEVOTED TO HIM AND THAT WHEN YOU MET YESTERDAY YOU MADE YOURSELF KNOWN TO HIM WITH TEARS OF JOY I SHOULD BE AN AFFECTED WOMAN IF I MADE ANY PRETENCE OF BEING SURPRISED BY MY SONS INSPIRING SUCH EMOTIONS BUT I CANNOT BE INDIFFERENT TO ANYONE WHO IS SO SENSIBLE OF HIS MERIT AND I AM VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU HERE AND CAN ASSURE YOU THAT HE FEELS AN UNUSUAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND THAT YOU MAY RELY ON HIS PROTECTION MISS DARTLE PLAYED BACKGAMMON AS EAGERLY AS SHE DID EVERYTHING ELSE IF I HAD SEEN HER FIRST AT THE BOARD I SHOULD HAVE FANCIED THAT HER FIGURE HAD GOT THIN AND HER EYES HAD GOT LARGE OVER THAT PURSUIT AND NO OTHER IN THE WORLD BUT I AM VERY MUCH MISTAKEN IF SHE MISSED A WORD OF THIS OR LOST A LOOK OF MINE AS I RECEIVED IT WITH THE UTMOST PLEASURE AND HONOURED BY MRS STEERFORTHS CONFIDENCE FELT OLDER THAN I HAD DONE SINCE I LEFT CANTERBURY WHEN THE EVENING WAS PRETTY FAR SPENT AND A TRAY OF GLASSES AND DECANTERS CAME IN STEERFORTH PROMISED OVER THE FIRE THAT HE WOULD SERIOUSLY THINK OF GOING DOWN INTO THE COUNTRY WITH ME THERE WAS NO HURRY HE SAID A WEEK HENCE WOULD DO AND HIS MOTHER HOSPITABLY SAID THE SAME WHILE WE WERE TALKING HE MORE THAN ONCE CALLED ME DAISY WHICH BROUGHT MISS DARTLE OUT AGAIN BUT REALLY MR COPPERFIELD SHE ASKED IS IT A NICKNAME AND WHY DOES HE GIVE IT YOU IS ITEHBECAUSE HE THINKS YOU YOUNG AND INNOCENT I AM SO STUPID IN THESE THINGS I COLOURED IN REPLYING THAT I BELIEVED IT WAS OH SAID MISS DARTLE NOW I AM GLAD TO KNOW THAT I ASK FOR INFORMATION AND I AM GLAD TO KNOW IT HE THINKS YOU YOUNG AND INNOCENT AND SO YOU ARE HIS FRIEND WELL THATS QUITE DELIGHTFUL SHE WENT TO BED SOON AFTER THIS AND MRS STEERFORTH RETIRED TOO STEERFORTH AND I AFTER LINGERING FOR HALFANHOUR OVER THE FIRE TALKING ABOUT TRADDLES AND ALL THE REST OF THEM AT OLD SALEM HOUSE WENT UPSTAIRS TOGETHER STEERFORTHS ROOM WAS NEXT TO MINE AND I WENT IN TO LOOK AT IT IT WAS A PICTURE OF COMFORT FULL OF EASYCHAIRS CUSHIONS AND FOOTSTOOLS WORKED BY HIS MOTHERS HAND AND WITH NO SORT OF THING OMITTED THAT COULD HELP TO RENDER IT COMPLETE FINALLY HER HANDSOME FEATURES LOOKED DOWN ON HER DARLING FROM A PORTRAIT ON THE WALL AS IF IT WERE EVEN SOMETHING TO HER THAT HER LIKENESS SHOULD WATCH HIM WHILE HE SLEPT I FOUND THE FIRE BURNING CLEAR ENOUGH IN MY ROOM BY THIS TIME AND THE CURTAINS DRAWN BEFORE THE WINDOWS AND ROUND THE BED GIVING IT A VERY SNUG APPEARANCE I SAT DOWN IN A GREAT CHAIR UPON THE HEARTH TO MEDITATE ON MY HAPPINESS AND HAD ENJOYED THE CONTEMPLATION OF IT FOR SOME TIME WHEN I FOUND A LIKENESS OF MISS DARTLE LOOKING EAGERLY AT ME FROM ABOVE THE CHIMNEYPIECE IT WAS A STARTLING LIKENESS AND NECESSARILY HAD A STARTLING LOOK THE PAINTER HADNT MADE THE SCAR BUT I MADE IT AND THERE IT WAS COMING AND GOING NOW CONFINED TO THE UPPER LIP AS I HAD SEEN IT AT DINNER AND NOW SHOWING THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE WOUND INFLICTED BY THE HAMMER AS I HAD SEEN IT WHEN SHE WAS PASSIONATE I WONDERED PEEVISHLY WHY THEY COULDNT PUT HER ANYWHERE ELSE INSTEAD OF QUARTERING HER ON ME TO GET RID OF HER I UNDRESSED QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED MY LIGHT AND WENT TO BED BUT AS I FELL ASLEEP I COULD NOT FORGET THAT SHE WAS STILL THERE LOOKING IS IT REALLY THOUGH I WANT TO KNOW AND WHEN I AWOKE IN THE NIGHT I FOUND THAT I WAS UNEASILY ASKING ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE IN MY DREAMS WHETHER IT REALLY WAS OR NOTWITHOUT KNOWING WHAT I MEANT CHAPTER LITTLE EMLY THERE WAS A SERVANT IN THAT HOUSE A MAN WHO I UNDERSTOOD WAS USUALLY WITH STEERFORTH AND HAD COME INTO HIS SERVICE AT THE UNIVERSITY WHO WAS IN APPEARANCE A PATTERN OF RESPECTABILITY I BELIEVE THERE NEVER EXISTED IN HIS STATION A MORE RESPECTABLELOOKING MAN HE WAS TACITURN SOFTFOOTED VERY QUIET IN HIS MANNER DEFERENTIAL OBSERVANT ALWAYS AT HAND WHEN WANTED AND NEVER NEAR WHEN NOT WANTED BUT HIS GREAT CLAIM TO CONSIDERATION WAS HIS RESPECTABILITY HE HAD NOT A PLIANT FACE HE HAD RATHER A STIFF NECK RATHER A TIGHT SMOOTH HEAD WITH SHORT HAIR CLINGING TO IT AT THE SIDES A SOFT WAY OF SPEAKING WITH A PECULIAR HABIT OF WHISPERING THE LETTER S SO DISTINCTLY THAT HE SEEMED TO USE IT OFTENER THAN ANY OTHER MAN BUT EVERY PECULIARITY THAT HE HAD HE MADE RESPECTABLE IF HIS NOSE HAD BEEN UPSIDEDOWN HE WOULD HAVE MADE THAT RESPECTABLE HE SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH AN ATMOSPHERE OF RESPECTABILITY AND WALKED SECURE IN IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO SUSPECT HIM OF ANYTHING WRONG HE WAS SO THOROUGHLY RESPECTABLE NOBODY COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF PUTTING HIM IN A LIVERY HE WAS SO HIGHLY RESPECTABLE TO HAVE IMPOSED ANY DEROGATORY WORK UPON HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN TO INFLICT A WANTON INSULT ON THE FEELINGS OF A MOST RESPECTABLE MAN AND OF THIS I NOTICEDTHE WOMENSERVANTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD WERE SO INTUITIVELY CONSCIOUS THAT THEY ALWAYS DID SUCH WORK THEMSELVES AND GENERALLY WHILE HE READ THE PAPER BY THE PANTRY FIRE SUCH A SELFCONTAINED MAN I NEVER SAW BUT IN THAT QUALITY AS IN EVERY OTHER HE POSSESSED HE ONLY SEEMED TO BE THE MORE RESPECTABLE EVEN THE FACT THAT NO ONE KNEW HIS CHRISTIAN NAME SEEMED TO FORM A PART OF HIS RESPECTABILITY NOTHING COULD BE OBJECTED AGAINST HIS SURNAME LITTIMER BY WHICH HE WAS KNOWN PETER MIGHT HAVE BEEN HANGED OR TOM TRANSPORTED BUT LITTIMER WAS PERFECTLY RESPECTABLE IT WAS OCCASIONED I SUPPOSE BY THE REVEREND NATURE OF RESPECTABILITY IN THE ABSTRACT BUT I FELT PARTICULARLY YOUNG IN THIS MANS PRESENCE HOW OLD HE WAS HIMSELF I COULD NOT GUESSAND THAT AGAIN WENT TO HIS CREDIT ON THE SAME SCORE FOR IN THE CALMNESS OF RESPECTABILITY HE MIGHT HAVE NUMBERED FIFTY YEARS AS WELL AS THIRTY LITTIMER WAS IN MY ROOM IN THE MORNING BEFORE I WAS UP TO BRING ME THAT REPROACHFUL SHAVINGWATER AND TO PUT OUT MY CLOTHES WHEN I UNDREW THE CURTAINS AND LOOKED OUT OF BED I SAW HIM IN AN EQUABLE TEMPERATURE OF RESPECTABILITY UNAFFECTED BY THE EAST WIND OF JANUARY AND NOT EVEN BREATHING FROSTILY STANDING MY BOOTS RIGHT AND LEFT IN THE FIRST DANCING POSITION AND BLOWING SPECKS OF DUST OFF MY COAT AS HE LAID IT DOWN LIKE A BABY I GAVE HIM GOOD MORNING AND ASKED HIM WHAT OCLOCK IT WAS HE TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET THE MOST RESPECTABLE HUNTINGWATCH I EVER SAW AND PREVENTING THE SPRING WITH HIS THUMB FROM OPENING FAR LOOKED IN AT THE FACE AS IF HE WERE CONSULTING AN ORACULAR OYSTER SHUT IT UP AGAIN AND SAID IF I PLEASED IT WAS HALF PAST EIGHT MR STEERFORTH WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR HOW YOU HAVE RESTED SIR THANK YOU SAID I VERY WELL INDEED IS MR STEERFORTH QUITE WELL THANK YOU SIR MR STEERFORTH IS TOLERABLY WELL ANOTHER OF HIS CHARACTERISTICSNO USE OF SUPERLATIVES A COOL CALM MEDIUM ALWAYS IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I CAN HAVE THE HONOUR OF DOING FOR YOU SIR THE WARNINGBELL WILL RING AT NINE THE FAMILY TAKE BREAKFAST AT HALF PAST NINE NOTHING I THANK YOU I THANK YOU SIR IF YOU PLEASE AND WITH THAT AND WITH A LITTLE INCLINATION OF HIS HEAD WHEN HE PASSED THE BEDSIDE AS AN APOLOGY FOR CORRECTING ME HE WENT OUT SHUTTING THE DOOR AS DELICATELY AS IF I HAD JUST FALLEN INTO A SWEET SLEEP ON WHICH MY LIFE DEPENDED EVERY MORNING WE HELD EXACTLY THIS CONVERSATION NEVER ANY MORE AND NEVER ANY LESS AND YET INVARIABLY HOWEVER FAR I MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIFTED OUT OF MYSELF OVERNIGHT AND ADVANCED TOWARDS MATURER YEARS BY STEERFORTHS COMPANIONSHIP OR MRS STEERFORTHS CONFIDENCE OR MISS DARTLES CONVERSATION IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MOST RESPECTABLE MAN I BECAME AS OUR SMALLER POETS SING A BOY AGAIN HE GOT HORSES FOR US AND STEERFORTH WHO KNEW EVERYTHING GAVE ME LESSONS IN RIDING HE PROVIDED FOILS FOR US AND STEERFORTH GAVE ME LESSONS IN FENCINGGLOVES AND I BEGAN OF THE SAME MASTER TO IMPROVE IN BOXING IT GAVE ME NO MANNER OF CONCERN THAT STEERFORTH SHOULD FIND ME A NOVICE IN THESE SCIENCES BUT I NEVER COULD BEAR TO SHOW MY WANT OF SKILL BEFORE THE RESPECTABLE LITTIMER I HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT LITTIMER UNDERSTOOD SUCH ARTS HIMSELF HE NEVER LED ME TO SUPPOSE ANYTHING OF THE KIND BY SO MUCH AS THE VIBRATION OF ONE OF HIS RESPECTABLE EYELASHES YET WHENEVER HE WAS BY WHILE WE WERE PRACTISING I FELT MYSELF THE GREENEST AND MOST INEXPERIENCED OF MORTALS I AM PARTICULAR ABOUT THIS MAN BECAUSE HE MADE A PARTICULAR EFFECT ON ME AT THAT TIME AND BECAUSE OF WHAT TOOK PLACE THEREAFTER THE WEEK PASSED AWAY IN A MOST DELIGHTFUL MANNER IT PASSED RAPIDLY AS MAY BE SUPPOSED TO ONE ENTRANCED AS I WAS AND YET IT GAVE ME SO MANY OCCASIONS FOR KNOWING STEERFORTH BETTER AND ADMIRING HIM MORE IN A THOUSAND RESPECTS THAT AT ITS CLOSE I SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN WITH HIM FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME A DASHING WAY HE HAD OF TREATING ME LIKE A PLAYTHING WAS MORE AGREEABLE TO ME THAN ANY BEHAVIOUR HE COULD HAVE ADOPTED IT REMINDED ME OF OUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE IT SEEMED THE NATURAL SEQUEL OF IT IT SHOWED ME THAT HE WAS UNCHANGED IT RELIEVED ME OF ANY UNEASINESS I MIGHT HAVE FELT IN COMPARING MY MERITS WITH HIS AND MEASURING MY CLAIMS UPON HIS FRIENDSHIP BY ANY EQUAL STANDARD ABOVE ALL IT WAS A FAMILIAR UNRESTRAINED AFFECTIONATE DEMEANOUR THAT HE USED TOWARDS NO ONE ELSE AS HE HAD TREATED ME AT SCHOOL DIFFERENTLY FROM ALL THE REST I JOYFULLY BELIEVED THAT HE TREATED ME IN LIFE UNLIKE ANY OTHER FRIEND HE HAD I BELIEVED THAT I WAS NEARER TO HIS HEART THAN ANY OTHER FRIEND AND MY OWN HEART WARMED WITH ATTACHMENT TO HIM HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO WITH ME INTO THE COUNTRY AND THE DAY ARRIVED FOR OUR DEPARTURE HE HAD BEEN DOUBTFUL AT FIRST WHETHER TO TAKE LITTIMER OR NOT BUT DECIDED TO LEAVE HIM AT HOME THE RESPECTABLE CREATURE SATISFIED WITH HIS LOT WHATEVER IT WAS ARRANGED OUR PORTMANTEAUX ON THE LITTLE CARRIAGE THAT WAS TO TAKE US INTO LONDON AS IF THEY WERE INTENDED TO DEFY THE SHOCKS OF AGES AND RECEIVED MY MODESTLY PROFFERED DONATION WITH PERFECT TRANQUILLITY WE BADE ADIEU TO MRS STEERFORTH AND MISS DARTLE WITH MANY THANKS ON MY PART AND MUCH KINDNESS ON THE DEVOTED MOTHERS THE LAST THING I SAW WAS LITTIMERS UNRUFFLED EYE FRAUGHT AS I FANCIED WITH THE SILENT CONVICTION THAT I WAS VERY YOUNG INDEED WHAT I FELT IN RETURNING SO AUSPICIOUSLY TO THE OLD FAMILIAR PLACES I SHALL NOT ENDEAVOUR TO DESCRIBE WE WENT DOWN BY THE MAIL I WAS SO CONCERNED I RECOLLECT EVEN FOR THE HONOUR OF YARMOUTH THAT WHEN STEERFORTH SAID AS WE DROVE THROUGH ITS DARK STREETS TO THE INN THAT AS WELL AS HE COULD MAKE OUT IT WAS A GOOD QUEER OUTOFTHEWAY KIND OF HOLE I WAS HIGHLY PLEASED WE WENT TO BED ON OUR ARRIVAL I OBSERVED A PAIR OF DIRTY SHOES AND GAITERS IN CONNEXION WITH MY OLD FRIEND THE DOLPHIN AS WE PASSED THAT DOOR AND BREAKFASTED LATE IN THE MORNING STEERFORTH WHO WAS IN GREAT SPIRITS HAD BEEN STROLLING ABOUT THE BEACH BEFORE I WAS UP AND HAD MADE ACQUAINTANCE HE SAID WITH HALF THE BOATMEN IN THE PLACE MOREOVER HE HAD SEEN IN THE DISTANCE WHAT HE WAS SURE MUST BE THE IDENTICAL HOUSE OF MR PEGGOTTY WITH SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE CHIMNEY AND HAD HAD A GREAT MIND HE TOLD ME TO WALK IN AND SWEAR HE WAS MYSELF GROWN OUT OF KNOWLEDGE WHEN DO YOU PROPOSE TO INTRODUCE ME THERE DAISY HE SAID I AM AT YOUR DISPOSAL MAKE YOUR OWN ARRANGEMENTS WHY I WAS THINKING THAT THIS EVENING WOULD BE A GOOD TIME STEERFORTH WHEN THEY ARE ALL SITTING ROUND THE FIRE I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO SEE IT WHEN ITS SNUG ITS SUCH A CURIOUS PLACE SO BE IT RETURNED STEERFORTH THIS EVENING I SHALL NOT GIVE THEM ANY NOTICE THAT WE ARE HERE

DELIVER YOU UP TO BE CRIED OVER FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS IS THAT LONG ENOUGH I ANSWERED LAUGHING THAT I THOUGHT WE MIGHT GET THROUGH IT IN THAT TIME BUT THAT HE MUST COME ALSO FOR HE WOULD FIND THAT HIS

MYSELF IN ANY STATE YOU PLEASE SENTIMENTAL OR COMICAL I GAVE HIM MINUTE DIRECTIONS FOR FINDING THE RESIDENCE OF MR BARKIS CARRIER TO BLUNDERSTONE AND ELSEWHERE AND ON THIS UNDERSTANDING WENT OUT ALONE

MYSELF IN THE PLEASURE OF BEING THERE THAT I COULD HAVE STOPPED THE PEOPLE IN THE STREETS AND SHAKEN HANDS WITH THEM THE STREETS LOOKED SMALL OF COURSE THE STREETS THAT WE HAVE ONLY SEEN AS CHILDREN

KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE WHAT IS THERE THAT ANY WOMAN COULDNT DO THAT SHE SHOULDNT DOESPECIALLY ON THE SUBJECT OF ANOTHER WOMANS GOOD LOOKS I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS ALL OVER WITH MR OMER AFTER HE HAD UTTERED THIS LIBELLOUS PLEASANTRY HE COUGHED TO THAT EXTENT AND HIS BREATH ELUDED ALL HIS ATTEMPTS TO RECOVER IT WITH THAT OBSTINACY THAT I FULLY EXPECTED TO SEE HIS HEAD GO DOWN BEHIND THE COUNTER AND HIS LITTLE BLACK BREECHES WITH THE RUSTY LITTLE BUNCHES OF RIBBONS AT THE KNEES COME QUIVERING UP IN A LAST INEFFECTUAL STRUGGLE AT LENGTH HOWEVER HE GOT BETTER THOUGH HE STILL PANTED HARD AND WAS SO EXHAUSTED THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO SIT ON THE STOOL OF THE SHOPDESK YOU SEE HE SAID WIPING HIS HEAD AND BREATHING WITH DIFFICULTY SHE HASNT TAKEN MUCH TO ANY COMPANIONS HERE SHE HASNT TAKEN KINDLY TO ANY PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCES AND FRIENDS NOT TO MENTION SWEETHEARTS IN CONSEQUENCE AN ILLNATURED STORY GOT ABOUT THAT EMLY WANTED TO BE A LADY NOW MY OPINION IS THAT IT CAME INTO CIRCULATION

HAS SAID SO TO ME I RETURNED EAGERLY WHEN WE WERE BOTH CHILDREN MR OMER NODDED HIS HEAD AND RUBBED HIS CHIN JUST SO THEN OUT OF A VERY LITTLE SHE COULD DRESS HERSELF YOU SEE BETTER THAN MOST OTHERS

DOUBT THAT SHE WAS NEAR ON MY ASKING NOW IF THAT WERE NOT SO MR OMER NODDED YES AND NODDED TOWARDS THE DOOR OF THE PARLOUR MY HURRIED INQUIRY IF I MIGHT PEEP IN WAS ANSWERED WITH A FREE PERMISSION AND LOOKING THROUGH THE GLASS I SAW HER SITTING AT HER WORK I SAW HER A MOST BEAUTIFUL LITTLE CREATURE WITH THE CLOUDLESS BLUE EYES THAT HAD LOOKED INTO MY CHILDISH HEART TURNED LAUGHINGLY UPON ANOTHER CHILD OF MINNIES WHO WAS PLAYING NEAR HER WITH ENOUGH OF WILFULNESS IN HER BRIGHT FACE TO JUSTIFY WHAT I HAD HEARD WITH MUCH OF THE OLD CAPRICIOUS COYNESS LURKING IN IT BUT WITH NOTHING IN HER PRETTY LOOKS I AM SURE BUT WHAT WAS MEANT FOR GOODNESS AND FOR HAPPINESS AND WHAT WAS ON A GOOD AND HAPPY COURSE THE TUNE ACROSS THE YARD THAT SEEMED AS IF IT NEVER HAD LEFT OFFALAS IT WAS THE TUNE THAT NEVER DOES LEAVE OFFWAS BEATING SOFTLY ALL THE WHILE WOULDNT YOU LIKE TO STEP IN SAID MR OMER AND SPEAK TO HER WALK IN AND SPEAK TO HER SIR MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME I WAS TOO BASHFUL TO DO SO THENI WAS AFRAID OF CONFUSING HER AND I WAS NO LESS AFRAID OF CONFUSING MYSELFBUT I INFORMED MYSELF OF THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE LEFT OF AN EVENING IN ORDER THAT OUR VISIT MIGHT BE TIMED ACCORDINGLY AND TAKING LEAVE OF MR OMER AND HIS PRETTY DAUGHTER AND HER LITTLE CHILDREN WENT AWAY TO MY DEAR OLD PEGGOTTYS HERE SHE WAS IN THE TILED KITCHEN COOKING DINNER THE MOMENT I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR SHE OPENED IT AND

YOU ARE HERE WILL YOU COME UP AND SEE HIM MY DEAR OF COURSE I WOULD BUT PEGGOTTY COULD NOT GET OUT OF THE ROOM AS EASILY AS SHE MEANT TO FOR AS OFTEN AS SHE GOT TO THE DOOR AND LOOKED ROUND AT ME SHE CAME BACK AGAIN TO HAVE ANOTHER LAUGH AND ANOTHER CRY UPON MY SHOULDER AT LAST TO MAKE THE MATTER EASIER I WENT UPSTAIRS WITH HER AND HAVING WAITED OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE WHILE SHE SAID A WORD OF PREPARATION TO MR BARKIS PRESENTED MYSELF BEFORE THAT INVALID HE RECEIVED ME WITH ABSOLUTE ENTHUSIASM HE WAS TOO RHEUMATIC TO BE SHAKEN HANDS WITH BUT HE BEGGED ME TO SHAKE THE TASSEL ON THE TOP OF HIS NIGHTCAP WHICH I DID MOST CORDIALLY WHEN I SAT DOWN BY THE SIDE OF THE BED HE SAID THAT IT DID HIM A WORLD OF GOOD TO FEEL AS IF HE WAS DRIVING ME ON THE BLUNDERSTONE ROAD AGAIN AS HE LAY IN BED FACE UPWARD AND SO COVERED WITH THAT EXCEPTION THAT HE SEEMED TO BE NOTHING BUT A FACELIKE A CONVENTIONAL CHERUBIMHE LOOKED THE QUEEREST OBJECT I EVER BEHELD WHAT NAME WAS IT AS I WROTE UP IN THE CART SIR SAID MR BARKIS WITH A SLOW RHEUMATIC SMILE AH MR BARKIS WE HAD SOME GRAVE TALKS ABOUT THAT MATTER HADNT WE I WAS WILLIN A LONG TIME SIR SAID MR BARKIS A LONG TIME SAID I AND I DONT REGRET IT SAID MR BARKIS DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ONCE ABOUT HER MAKING ALL THE APPLE PARSTIES AND DOING ALL THE COOKING YES VERY WELL I RETURNED IT WAS AS TRUE SAID MR BARKIS AS TURNIPS IS IT WAS AS TRUE SAID MR BARKIS NODDING HIS NIGHTCAP WHICH WAS HIS ONLY MEANS OF EMPHASIS AS TAXES IS AND NOTHINGS TRUER THAN THEM MR BARKIS TURNED HIS EYES UPON ME AS IF FOR MY ASSENT TO THIS RESULT OF HIS REFLECTIONS IN BED AND I GAVE IT NOTHINGS TRUER THAN THEM REPEATED MR BARKIS A MAN AS POOR AS I AM FINDS THAT OUT IN HIS MIND WHEN HES LAID UP IM A VERY POOR MAN SIR I AM SORRY TO HEAR IT MR BARKIS A VERY POOR MAN INDEED I AM SAID MR BARKIS HERE HIS RIGHT HAND CAME SLOWLY AND FEEBLY FROM UNDER THE BEDCLOTHES AND WITH A PURPOSELESS UNCERTAIN GRASP TOOK HOLD OF A STICK WHICH WAS LOOSELY TIED TO THE SIDE OF THE BED AFTER SOME POKING ABOUT WITH THIS INSTRUMENT IN THE COURSE OF WHICH HIS FACE ASSUMED A VARIETY OF DISTRACTED EXPRESSIONS MR BARKIS POKED IT AGAINST A BOX AN END OF WHICH HAD BEEN VISIBLE TO ME ALL THE TIME THEN HIS FACE BECAME COMPOSED OLD CLOTHES SAID MR BARKIS OH SAID I I WISH IT WAS MONEY SIR SAID MR BARKIS I WISH IT WAS INDEED SAID I BUT IT AINT SAID MR BARKIS OPENING BOTH HIS EYES AS WIDE AS HE POSSIBLY COULD I EXPRESSED MYSELF QUITE SURE OF THAT AND MR BARKIS TURNING HIS EYES MORE GENTLY TO HIS WIFE SAID SHES THE USEFULLEST AND BEST OF WOMEN C P BARKIS ALL THE PRAISE THAT ANYONE CAN GIVE TO C P BARKIS SHE DESERVES AND MORE MY DEAR YOULL GET A DINNER TODAY FOR COMPANY SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT AND DRINK WILL YOU I SHOULD HAVE PROTESTED AGAINST THIS UNNECESSARY DEMONSTRATION IN MY HONOUR BUT THAT I SAW PEGGOTTY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BED EXTREMELY ANXIOUS I SHOULD NOT SO I HELD MY PEACE I HAVE GOT A TRIFLE OF MONEY SOMEWHERE ABOUT ME MY DEAR SAID MR BARKIS BUT IM A LITTLE TIRED IF YOU AND MR DAVID WILL LEAVE ME FOR A SHORT NAP ILL TRY AND FIND IT WHEN I WAKE WE LEFT THE ROOM IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS REQUEST WHEN WE GOT OUTSIDE THE DOOR PEGGOTTY INFORMED ME THAT MR BARKIS BEING NOW A LITTLE NEARER THAN HE USED TO BE ALWAYS RESORTED TO THIS SAME DEVICE BEFORE PRODUCING A SINGLE COIN FROM HIS STORE AND THAT HE ENDURED UNHEARDOF AGONIES IN CRAWLING OUT OF BED ALONE AND TAKING IT FROM THAT UNLUCKY BOX IN EFFECT WE PRESENTLY HEARD HIM UTTERING SUPPRESSED GROANS OF THE MOST DISMAL NATURE AS THIS MAGPIE PROCEEDING RACKED HIM IN EVERY JOINT BUT WHILE PEGGOTTYS EYES WERE FULL OF COMPASSION FOR HIM SHE SAID HIS GENEROUS IMPULSE WOULD DO HIM GOOD AND IT WAS BETTER NOT TO CHECK IT SO HE GROANED ON UNTIL HE HAD GOT INTO BED AGAIN SUFFERING I HAVE NO DOUBT A MARTYRDOM AND THEN CALLED US IN PRETENDING TO HAVE JUST WOKE UP FROM A REFRESHING SLEEP AND TO PRODUCE A GUINEA FROM UNDER HIS PILLOW HIS SATISFACTION IN WHICH HAPPY IMPOSITION ON US AND IN HAVING PRESERVED THE IMPENETRABLE SECRET OF THE BOX APPEARED TO BE A SUFFICIENT COMPENSATION TO HIM FOR ALL HIS TORTURES I PREPARED PEGGOTTY FOR STEERFORTHS ARRIVAL AND IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE CAME I AM PERSUADED SHE KNEW NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIS HAVING BEEN A PERSONAL BENEFACTOR OF HERS AND A KIND FRIEND TO ME AND THAT SHE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE UTMOST GRATITUDE AND DEVOTION IN ANY CASE BUT HIS EASY SPIRITED GOOD HUMOUR HIS GENIAL MANNER HIS HANDSOME LOOKS HIS NATURAL GIFT OF ADAPTING HIMSELF TO WHOMSOEVER HE PLEASED AND MAKING DIRECT WHEN HE CARED TO DO IT TO THE MAIN POINT OF INTEREST IN ANYBODYS HEART BOUND HER TO HIM WHOLLY IN FIVE MINUTES HIS MANNER TO ME ALONE WOULD HAVE WON HER BUT THROUGH ALL THESE CAUSES COMBINED I SINCERELY BELIEVE SHE HAD A KIND OF ADORATION FOR HIM BEFORE HE LEFT THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT HE STAYED THERE WITH ME TO DINNERIF I WERE TO SAY WILLINGLY I SHOULD NOT HALF EXPRESS HOW READILY AND GAILY HE WENT INTO MR BARKISS ROOM LIKE LIGHT AND AIR BRIGHTENING AND REFRESHING IT AS IF HE WERE HEALTHY WEATHER THERE WAS NO NOISE NO EFFORT NO CONSCIOUSNESS IN ANYTHING HE DID BUT IN EVERYTHING AN INDESCRIBABLE LIGHTNESS A SEEMING IMPOSSIBILITY OF DOING ANYTHING ELSE OR DOING ANYTHING BETTER WHICH WAS SO GRACEFUL SO NATURAL AND AGREEABLE THAT IT OVERCOMES ME EVEN NOW IN THE REMEMBRANCE WE MADE MERRY IN THE LITTLE PARLOUR WHERE THE BOOK OF MARTYRS UNTHUMBED SINCE MY TIME WAS LAID OUT UPON THE DESK AS OF OLD AND WHERE I NOW TURNED OVER ITS TERRIFIC PICTURES REMEMBERING THE OLD SENSATIONS THEY HAD AWAKENED BUT NOT FEELING THEM WHEN PEGGOTTY SPOKE OF WHAT SHE CALLED MY ROOM AND OF ITS BEING READY FOR ME AT NIGHT AND OF HER HOPING I WOULD OCCUPY IT BEFORE I COULD SO MUCH AS LOOK AT STEERFORTH HESITATING HE WAS POSSESSED OF THE WHOLE CASE OF COURSE HE SAID YOULL SLEEP HERE WHILE WE STAY AND I SHALL SLEEP AT THE HOTEL BUT TO BRING YOU SO FAR I RETURNED AND TO SEPARATE SEEMS BAD COMPANIONSHIP STEERFORTH WHY IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN WHERE DO YOU NATURALLY BELONG HE SAID WHAT IS SEEMS COMPARED TO THAT IT WAS SETTLED AT ONCE HE MAINTAINED ALL HIS DELIGHTFUL QUALITIES TO THE LAST UNTIL WE STARTED FORTH AT EIGHT OCLOCK FOR MR PEGGOTTYS BOAT INDEED THEY WERE MORE AND MORE BRIGHTLY EXHIBITED AS THE HOURS WENT ON FOR I THOUGHT EVEN THEN AND I HAVE NO DOUBT NOW THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SUCCESS IN HIS DETERMINATION TO PLEASE INSPIRED HIM WITH A NEW DELICACY OF PERCEPTION AND MADE IT SUBTLE AS IT WAS MORE EASY TO HIM IF ANYONE HAD TOLD ME THEN THAT ALL THIS WAS A BRILLIANT GAME PLAYED FOR THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF HIGH SPIRITS IN THE THOUGHTLESS LOVE OF SUPERIORITY IN A MERE WASTEFUL CARELESS COURSE OF WINNING WHAT WAS WORTHLESS TO HIM AND NEXT MINUTE THROWN AWAYI SAY IF ANYONE HAD TOLD ME SUCH A LIE THAT NIGHT I WONDER IN WHAT MANNER OF RECEIVING IT MY INDIGNATION WOULD HAVE FOUND A VENT PROBABLY ONLY IN AN INCREASE HAD THAT BEEN POSSIBLE OF THE ROMANTIC FEELINGS OF FIDELITY AND FRIENDSHIP WITH WHICH I WALKED BESIDE HIM OVER THE DARK WINTRY SANDS TOWARDS THE OLD BOAT THE WIND SIGHING AROUND US EVEN MORE MOURNFULLY THAN IT HAD SIGHED AND MOANED UPON THE NIGHT WHEN I FIRST DARKENED MR PEGGOTTYS DOOR THIS IS A WILD KIND OF PLACE STEERFORTH IS IT NOT DISMAL ENOUGH IN THE DARK HE SAID AND THE SEA ROARS AS IF IT WERE HUNGRY FOR US IS THAT THE BOAT WHERE I SEE A LIGHT YONDER THATS THE BOAT SAID I AND ITS THE SAME I SAW THIS MORNING HE RETURNED I CAME STRAIGHT TO IT BY INSTINCT I SUPPOSE WE SAID NO MORE AS WE APPROACHED THE LIGHT BUT MADE SOFTLY FOR THE DOOR I LAID MY HAND UPON THE LATCH AND WHISPERING STEERFORTH TO KEEP CLOSE TO ME WENT IN A MURMUR OF VOICES HAD BEEN AUDIBLE ON THE OUTSIDE AND AT THE MOMENT OF OUR ENTRANCE A CLAPPING OF HANDS WHICH LATTER NOISE I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE PROCEEDED FROM THE GENERALLY DISCONSOLATE MRS GUMMIDGE BUT MRS GUMMIDGE WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON THERE WHO WAS UNUSUALLY EXCITED MR PEGGOTTY HIS FACE LIGHTED UP WITH UNCOMMON SATISFACTION AND LAUGHING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT HELD HIS ROUGH ARMS WIDE OPEN AS IF FOR LITTLE EMLY TO RUN INTO THEM HAM WITH A MIXED EXPRESSION IN HIS FACE OF ADMIRATION EXULTATION AND A LUMBERING SORT OF BASHFULNESS THAT SAT UPON HIM VERY WELL HELD LITTLE EMLY BY THE HAND AS IF HE WERE PRESENTING HER TO MR PEGGOTTY LITTLE EMLY HERSELF BLUSHING AND SHY BUT DELIGHTED WITH MR PEGGOTTYS DELIGHT AS HER JOYOUS EYES EXPRESSED WAS STOPPED BY OUR ENTRANCE FOR SHE SAW US FIRST IN THE VERY ACT OF SPRINGING FROM HAM TO NESTLE IN MR PEGGOTTYS EMBRACE IN THE FIRST GLIMPSE WE HAD OF THEM ALL AND AT THE MOMENT OF OUR PASSING FROM THE DARK COLD NIGHT INTO THE WARM LIGHT ROOM THIS WAS THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE ALL EMPLOYED MRS GUMMIDGE IN THE BACKGROUND CLAPPING HER HANDS LIKE A MADWOMAN THE LITTLE PICTURE WAS SO INSTANTANEOUSLY DISSOLVED BY OUR GOING IN THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE DOUBTED WHETHER IT HAD EVER BEEN I WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE ASTONISHED FAMILY FACE TO FACE WITH MR PEGGOTTY AND HOLDING OUT MY HAND TO HIM WHEN HAM SHOUTED MASR DAVY ITS MASR DAVY IN A MOMENT WE WERE ALL SHAKING HANDS WITH ONE ANOTHER AND ASKING ONE ANOTHER HOW WE DID AND TELLING ONE ANOTHER HOW GLAD WE WERE TO MEET AND ALL TALKING AT ONCE MR PEGGOTTY WAS SO PROUD AND OVERJOYED TO SEE US THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY OR DO BUT KEPT OVER AND OVER AGAIN SHAKING HANDS WITH ME AND THEN WITH STEERFORTH AND THEN WITH ME AND

OF WHAT HE FELT FOR THE PRETTY LITTLE CREATURE WHO HAD WON HIS HEART I THOUGHT THE SIMPLE CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN US BY MR PEGGOTTY AND BY HIMSELF WAS IN ITSELF AFFECTING I WAS AFFECTED BY THE STORY ALTOGETHER HOW FAR MY EMOTIONS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE RECOLLECTIONS OF MY CHILDHOOD I DONT KNOW WHETHER I HAD COME THERE WITH ANY LINGERING FANCY THAT I WAS STILL TO LOVE LITTLE EMLY I DONT KNOW I KNOW THAT I WAS FILLED WITH PLEASURE BY ALL THIS BUT AT FIRST WITH AN INDESCRIBABLY SENSITIVE PLEASURE THAT A VERY LITTLE WOULD HAVE CHANGED TO PAIN THEREFORE IF IT HAD DEPENDED UPON ME TO TOUCH THE PREVAILING CHORD AMONG THEM WITH ANY SKILL I SHOULD HAVE MADE A POOR HAND OF IT BUT IT DEPENDED UPON STEERFORTH AND HE DID IT WITH SUCH ADDRESS THAT IN A FEW MINUTES WE WERE ALL AS EASY AND AS HAPPY AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BE MR PEGGOTTY HE SAID YOU ARE A THOROUGHLY GOOD FELLOW AND DESERVE TO BE AS HAPPY AS YOU ARE TONIGHT MY HAND UPON IT HAM I GIVE YOU JOY MY BOY MY HAND UPON THAT TOO DAISY STIR THE FIRE AND MAKE IT A BRISK ONE AND MR PEGGOTTY UNLESS YOU CAN INDUCE YOUR GENTLE NIECE TO COME BACK FOR WHOM I VACATE THIS SEAT IN THE CORNER I SHALL GO ANY GAP AT YOUR FIRESIDE ON SUCH A NIGHTSUCH A GAP LEAST OF ALLI WOULDNT MAKE FOR THE WEALTH OF THE INDIES SO MR PEGGOTTY WENT INTO MY OLD ROOM TO FETCH LITTLE EMLY AT FIRST LITTLE EMLY DIDNT LIKE TO COME AND THEN HAM WENT PRESENTLY THEY BROUGHT HER TO THE FIRESIDE VERY MUCH CONFUSED AND VERY SHYBUT SHE SOON BECAME MORE ASSURED WHEN SHE FOUND HOW GENTLY AND RESPECTFULLY STEERFORTH SPOKE TO HER HOW SKILFULLY HE AVOIDED ANYTHING THAT WOULD EMBARRASS HER HOW HE TALKED TO MR PEGGOTTY OF BOATS AND SHIPS AND TIDES AND FISH HOW HE REFERRED TO ME ABOUT THE TIME WHEN HE HAD SEEN MR PEGGOTTY AT SALEM HOUSE HOW DELIGHTED HE WAS WITH THE BOAT AND ALL BELONGING TO IT HOW LIGHTLY AND EASILY HE CARRIED ON UNTIL HE BROUGHT US BY DEGREES INTO A CHARMED CIRCLE AND WE WERE ALL TALKING AWAY WITHOUT ANY RESERVE EMLY INDEED SAID LITTLE ALL THE EVENING BUT SHE LOOKED AND LISTENED AND HER FACE GOT ANIMATED AND SHE WAS CHARMING STEERFORTH TOLD A STORY OF A DISMAL SHIPWRECK WHICH AROSE OUT OF HIS TALK WITH MR PEGGOTTY AS IF HE SAW IT ALL BEFORE HIMAND LITTLE EMLYS EYES WERE FASTENED ON HIM ALL THE TIME AS IF SHE SAW IT TOO HE TOLD US A MERRY ADVENTURE OF HIS OWN AS A RELIEF TO THAT WITH AS MUCH GAIETY AS IF THE NARRATIVE WERE AS FRESH TO HIM AS IT WAS TO USAND LITTLE EMLY LAUGHED UNTIL THE BOAT RANG WITH THE MUSICAL SOUNDS AND WE ALL LAUGHED STEERFORTH TOO IN IRRESISTIBLE SYMPATHY WITH WHAT WAS SO PLEASANT AND LIGHTHEARTED HE GOT MR PEGGOTTY TO SING OR RATHER TO ROAR WHEN THE STORMY WINDS DO BLOW DO BLOW DO BLOW AND HE SANG A SAILORS SONG HIMSELF SO PATHETICALLY AND BEAUTIFULLY THAT I COULD HAVE ALMOST FANCIED THAT THE REAL WIND CREEPING SORROWFULLY ROUND THE HOUSE AND MURMURING LOW THROUGH OUR UNBROKEN SILENCE WAS THERE TO LISTEN AS TO MRS GUMMIDGE HE ROUSED THAT VICTIM OF DESPONDENCY WITH A SUCCESS NEVER ATTAINED BY ANYONE ELSE SO MR PEGGOTTY INFORMED ME SINCE THE DECEASE OF THE OLD ONE HE LEFT HER SO LITTLE LEISURE FOR BEING MISERABLE THAT SHE SAID NEXT DAY SHE THOUGHT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED BUT HE SET UP NO MONOPOLY OF THE GENERAL ATTENTION OR THE CONVERSATION WHEN LITTLE EMLY GREW MORE COURAGEOUS AND TALKED BUT STILL BASHFULLY ACROSS THE FIRE TO ME OF OUR OLD WANDERINGS UPON THE BEACH TO PICK UP SHELLS AND PEBBLES AND WHEN I ASKED HER IF SHE RECOLLECTED HOW I USED TO BE DEVOTED TO HER AND WHEN WE BOTH LAUGHED AND REDDENED CASTING THESE LOOKS BACK ON THE PLEASANT OLD TIMES SO UNREAL TO LOOK AT NOW HE WAS SILENT AND ATTENTIVE AND OBSERVED US THOUGHTFULLY SHE SAT AT THIS TIME AND ALL THE EVENING ON THE OLD LOCKER IN HER OLD LITTLE CORNER BY THE FIREHAM BESIDE HER WHERE I USED TO SIT I COULD NOT SATISFY MYSELF WHETHER IT WAS IN HER OWN LITTLE TORMENTING WAY OR IN A MAIDENLY RESERVE BEFORE US THAT SHE KEPT QUITE CLOSE TO THE WALL AND AWAY FROM HIM BUT I OBSERVED THAT SHE DID SO ALL THE EVENING AS I REMEMBER IT WAS ALMOST MIDNIGHT WHEN WE TOOK OUR LEAVE WE HAD HAD SOME BISCUIT AND DRIED FISH FOR SUPPER AND STEERFORTH HAD PRODUCED FROM HIS POCKET A FULL FLASK OF HOLLANDS WHICH WE MEN I MAY SAY WE MEN NOW WITHOUT A BLUSH HAD EMPTIED WE PARTED MERRILY AND AS THEY ALL STOOD CROWDED ROUND THE DOOR TO LIGHT US AS FAR AS THEY COULD UPON OUR ROAD I SAW THE SWEET BLUE EYES OF LITTLE EMLY PEEPING AFTER US FROM BEHIND HAM AND HEARD HER SOFT VOICE CALLING TO US TO BE CAREFUL HOW WE WENT A MOST ENGAGING LITTLE BEAUTY SAID STEERFORTH TAKING MY ARM WELL ITS A QUAINT PLACE AND THEY ARE QUAINT COMPANY AND ITS QUITE A NEW SENSATION TO MIX WITH THEM HOW FORTUNATE WE ARE TOO I RETURNED TO HAVE ARRIVED TO WITNESS THEIR HAPPINESS IN THAT INTENDED MARRIAGE I NEVER SAW PEOPLE SO HAPPY HOW DELIGHTFUL TO SEE IT AND TO BE MADE THE SHARERS IN THEIR HONEST JOY AS WE HAVE BEEN THATS RATHER A CHUCKLEHEADED FELLOW FOR THE GIRL ISNT HE SAID STEERFORTH HE HAD BEEN SO HEARTY WITH HIM AND WITH THEM ALL THAT I FELT A SHOCK IN THIS UNEXPECTED AND COLD REPLY BUT TURNING QUICKLY UPON HIM AND SEEING A LAUGH IN HIS EYES I ANSWERED MUCH RELIEVED AH STEERFORTH ITS WELL FOR YOU TO JOKE ABOUT THE POOR YOU MAY SKIRMISH WITH MISS DARTLE OR TRY TO HIDE YOUR SYMPATHIES IN JEST FROM ME BUT I KNOW BETTER WHEN I SEE HOW PERFECTLY YOU UNDERSTAND THEM HOW EXQUISITELY YOU CAN ENTER INTO HAPPINESS LIKE THIS PLAIN FISHERMANS OR HUMOUR A LOVE LIKE MY OLD NURSES I KNOW THAT THERE IS NOT A JOY OR SORROW NOT AN EMOTION OF SUCH PEOPLE THAT CAN BE INDIFFERENT TO YOU AND I ADMIRE AND LOVE YOU FOR IT STEERFORTH TWENTY TIMES THE MORE HE STOPPED AND LOOKING IN MY FACE SAID DAISY I BELIEVE YOU ARE IN EARNEST AND ARE GOOD I WISH WE ALL WERE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS GAILY SINGING MR PEGGOTTYS SONG AS WE WALKED AT A ROUND PACE BACK TO YARMOUTH CHAPTER SOME OLD SCENES AND SOME NEW PEOPLE STEERFORTH AND I STAYED FOR MORE THAN A FORTNIGHT IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY WE WERE VERY MUCH TOGETHER I NEED NOT SAY BUT OCCASIONALLY WE WERE ASUNDER FOR SOME HOURS AT A TIME HE WAS A GOOD SAILOR AND I WAS BUT AN INDIFFERENT ONE AND WHEN HE WENT OUT BOATING WITH MR PEGGOTTY WHICH WAS A FAVOURITE AMUSEMENT OF HIS I GENERALLY REMAINED ASHORE MY OCCUPATION OF PEGGOTTYS SPAREROOM PUT A CONSTRAINT UPON ME FROM WHICH HE WAS FREE FOR KNOWING HOW ASSIDUOUSLY SHE ATTENDED ON MR BARKIS ALL DAY I DID NOT LIKE TO REMAIN OUT LATE AT NIGHT WHEREAS STEERFORTH LYING AT THE INN HAD NOTHING TO CONSULT BUT HIS OWN HUMOUR THUS IT CAME ABOUT THAT I HEARD OF HIS MAKING LITTLE TREATS FOR THE FISHERMEN AT MR PEGGOTTYS HOUSE OF CALL THE WILLING MIND AFTER I WAS IN BED AND OF HIS BEING AFLOAT WRAPPED IN FISHERMENS CLOTHES WHOLE MOONLIGHT NIGHTS AND COMING BACK WHEN THE MORNING TIDE WAS AT FLOOD BY THIS TIME HOWEVER I KNEW THAT HIS RESTLESS NATURE AND BOLD SPIRITS DELIGHTED TO FIND A VENT IN ROUGH TOIL AND HARD WEATHER AS IN ANY OTHER MEANS OF EXCITEMENT THAT PRESENTED ITSELF FRESHLY TO HIM SO NONE OF HIS PROCEEDINGS SURPRISED ME ANOTHER CAUSE OF OUR BEING SOMETIMES APART WAS THAT I HAD NATURALLY AN INTEREST IN GOING OVER TO BLUNDERSTONE AND REVISITING THE OLD FAMILIAR SCENES OF MY CHILDHOOD WHILE STEERFORTH AFTER BEING THERE ONCE HAD NATURALLY NO GREAT INTEREST IN GOING THERE AGAIN HENCE ON THREE OR FOUR DAYS THAT I CAN AT ONCE RECALL WE WENT OUR SEVERAL WAYS AFTER AN EARLY BREAKFAST AND MET AGAIN AT A LATE DINNER I HAD NO IDEA HOW HE EMPLOYED HIS TIME IN THE INTERVAL BEYOND A GENERAL KNOWLEDGE THAT HE WAS VERY POPULAR IN THE PLACE AND HAD TWENTY MEANS OF ACTIVELY DIVERTING HIMSELF WHERE ANOTHER MAN MIGHT NOT HAVE FOUND ONE FOR MY OWN PART MY OCCUPATION IN MY SOLITARY PILGRIMAGES WAS TO RECALL EVERY YARD OF THE OLD ROAD AS I WENT ALONG IT AND TO HAUNT THE OLD SPOTS OF WHICH I NEVER TIRED I HAUNTED THEM AS MY MEMORY HAD OFTEN DONE AND LINGERED AMONG THEM AS MY YOUNGER THOUGHTS HAD LINGERED WHEN I WAS FAR AWAY THE GRAVE BENEATH THE TREE WHERE BOTH MY PARENTS LAYON WHICH I HAD LOOKED OUT WHEN IT WAS MY FATHERS ONLY WITH SUCH CURIOUS FEELINGS OF COMPASSION AND BY WHICH I HAD STOOD SO DESOLATE WHEN IT WAS OPENED TO RECEIVE MY PRETTY MOTHER AND HER BABYTHE GRAVE WHICH PEGGOTTYS OWN FAITHFUL CARE HAD EVER SINCE KEPT NEAT AND MADE A GARDEN OF I WALKED NEAR BY THE HOUR IT LAY A LITTLE OFF THE CHURCHYARD PATH IN A QUIET CORNER NOT SO FAR REMOVED BUT I COULD READ THE NAMES UPON THE STONE AS I WALKED TO AND FRO STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF THE CHURCHBELL WHEN IT STRUCK THE HOUR FOR IT WAS LIKE A DEPARTED VOICE TO ME MY REFLECTIONS AT THESE TIMES WERE ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIGURE I WAS TO MAKE IN LIFE AND THE DISTINGUISHED THINGS I WAS TO DO MY ECHOING FOOTSTEPS WENT TO NO OTHER TUNE BUT WERE AS CONSTANT TO THAT AS IF I HAD COME HOME TO BUILD MY CASTLES IN THE AIR AT A LIVING MOTHERS SIDE THERE WERE GREAT CHANGES IN MY OLD HOME THE RAGGED NESTS SO LONG DESERTED BY THE ROOKS WERE GONE AND THE TREES WERE LOPPED AND TOPPED OUT OF THEIR REMEMBERED SHAPES THE GARDEN HAD RUN WILD AND HALF THE WINDOWS OF THE HOUSE WERE SHUT UP IT WAS OCCUPIED BUT ONLY BY A POOR LUNATIC GENTLEMAN AND THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK CARE OF HIM HE WAS ALWAYS SITTING AT MY LITTLE WINDOW LOOKING OUT INTO THE CHURCHYARD AND I WONDERED WHETHER HIS RAMBLING THOUGHTS EVER WENT UPON ANY OF THE FANCIES THAT USED TO OCCUPY MINE ON THE ROSY MORNINGS WHEN I PEEPED OUT OF THAT SAME LITTLE WINDOW IN MY NIGHTCLOTHES AND SAW THE SHEEP QUIETLY FEEDING IN THE LIGHT OF THE RISING SUN OUR OLD NEIGHBOURS MR AND MRS GRAYPER WERE GONE TO SOUTH AMERICA AND THE RAIN HAD MADE ITS WAY THROUGH THE ROOF OF THEIR EMPTY HOUSE AND STAINED THE OUTER WALLS MR CHILLIP WAS MARRIED AGAIN TO A TALL RAWBONED HIGHNOSED WIFE AND THEY HAD A WEAZEN LITTLE BABY WITH A HEAVY HEAD THAT IT COULDNT HOLD UP AND TWO WEAK STARING EYES WITH WHICH IT SEEMED TO BE ALWAYS WONDERING WHY IT HAD EVER BEEN BORN IT WAS WITH A SINGULAR JUMBLE OF SADNESS AND PLEASURE THAT I USED TO LINGER ABOUT MY NATIVE PLACE UNTIL THE REDDENING WINTER SUN ADMONISHED ME THAT IT WAS TIME TO START ON MY RETURNING WALK BUT WHEN THE PLACE WAS LEFT BEHIND AND ESPECIALLY WHEN STEERFORTH AND I WERE HAPPILY SEATED OVER OUR DINNER BY A BLAZING FIRE IT WAS DELICIOUS TO THINK OF HAVING BEEN THERE SO IT WAS THOUGH IN A SOFTENED DEGREE WHEN I WENT TO MY NEAT ROOM AT NIGHT AND TURNING OVER THE LEAVES OF THE CROCODILEBOOK WHICH WAS ALWAYS THERE UPON A LITTLE TABLE REMEMBERED WITH A GRATEFUL HEART HOW BLEST I WAS IN HAVING SUCH A FRIEND AS STEERFORTH SUCH A FRIEND AS PEGGOTTY AND SUCH A SUBSTITUTE FOR WHAT I HAD LOST AS MY EXCELLENT AND GENEROUS AUNT MY NEAREST WAY TO YARMOUTH IN COMING BACK FROM THESE LONG WALKS WAS BY A FERRY IT LANDED ME ON THE FLAT BETWEEN THE TOWN AND THE SEA WHICH I COULD MAKE STRAIGHT ACROSS AND SO SAVE MYSELF A CONSIDERABLE CIRCUIT BY THE HIGH ROAD MR PEGGOTTYS HOUSE BEING ON THAT WASTEPLACE AND NOT A HUNDRED YARDS OUT OF MY TRACK I ALWAYS LOOKED IN AS I WENT BY STEERFORTH WAS PRETTY SURE TO BE THERE EXPECTING ME AND WE WENT ON TOGETHER THROUGH THE FROSTY AIR AND GATHERING FOG TOWARDS THE TWINKLING LIGHTS OF THE TOWN ONE DARK EVENING WHEN I WAS LATER THAN USUALFOR I HAD THAT DAY BEEN MAKING MY PARTING VISIT TO BLUNDERSTONE AS WE WERE NOW ABOUT TO RETURN HOMEI FOUND HIM ALONE IN MR PEGGOTTYS HOUSE SITTING THOUGHTFULLY BEFORE THE FIRE HE WAS SO INTENT UPON HIS OWN REFLECTIONS THAT HE WAS QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF MY APPROACH THIS INDEED HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN IF HE HAD BEEN LESS ABSORBED FOR FOOTSTEPS FELL NOISELESSLY ON THE SANDY GROUND OUTSIDE BUT EVEN MY ENTRANCE FAILED TO ROUSE HIM I WAS STANDING CLOSE TO HIM LOOKING AT HIM AND STILL WITH A HEAVY BROW HE WAS LOST IN HIS MEDITATIONS HE GAVE SUCH A START WHEN I PUT MY HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER THAT HE MADE ME START TOO YOU COME UPON ME HE SAID ALMOST ANGRILY LIKE A REPROACHFUL GHOST I WAS OBLIGED TO ANNOUNCE MYSELF SOMEHOW I REPLIED HAVE I CALLED YOU DOWN FROM THE STARS NO HE ANSWERED NO UP FROM ANYWHERE THEN SAID I TAKING MY SEAT NEAR HIM I WAS LOOKING AT THE PICTURES IN THE FIRE HE RETURNED BUT YOU ARE SPOILING THEM FOR ME SAID I AS HE STIRRED IT QUICKLY WITH A PIECE OF BURNING WOOD STRIKING OUT OF IT A TRAIN OF REDHOT SPARKS THAT WENT CAREERING UP THE LITTLE CHIMNEY AND ROARING OUT INTO THE AIR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN THEM HE RETURNED I DETEST THIS MONGREL TIME NEITHER DAY NOR NIGHT HOW LATE YOU ARE WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN I HAVE BEEN TAKING LEAVE OF MY USUAL WALK SAID I AND I HAVE BEEN SITTING HERE SAID STEERFORTH GLANCING ROUND THE ROOM THINKING THAT ALL THE PEOPLE WE FOUND SO GLAD ON THE NIGHT OF OUR COMING DOWN MIGHTTO JUDGE FROM THE PRESENT WASTED AIR OF THE PLACEBE DISPERSED OR DEAD OR COME TO I DONT KNOW WHAT HARM DAVID I WISH TO GOD I HAD HAD A JUDICIOUS FATHER THESE LAST TWENTY YEARS MY DEAR STEERFORTH WHAT IS THE MATTER I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL I HAD BEEN BETTER GUIDED HE EXCLAIMED I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL I COULD GUIDE MYSELF BETTER THERE WAS A PASSIONATE DEJECTION IN HIS MANNER THAT QUITE AMAZED ME HE WAS MORE UNLIKE HIMSELF THAN I COULD HAVE SUPPOSED POSSIBLE IT WOULD BE BETTER TO BE THIS POOR PEGGOTTY OR HIS LOUT OF A NEPHEW HE SAID GETTING UP AND LEANING MOODILY AGAINST THE CHIMNEYPIECE WITH HIS FACE TOWARDS THE FIRE THAN TO BE MYSELF TWENTY TIMES RICHER AND TWENTY TIMES WISER AND BE THE TORMENT TO MYSELF THAT I HAVE BEEN IN THIS DEVILS BARK OF A BOAT WITHIN THE LAST HALFHOUR I WAS SO CONFOUNDED BY THE ALTERATION IN HIM THAT AT FIRST I COULD ONLY OBSERVE HIM IN SILENCE AS HE STOOD LEANING HIS HEAD UPON HIS HAND AND LOOKING GLOOMILY DOWN AT THE FIRE AT LENGTH I BEGGED HIM WITH ALL THE EARNESTNESS I FELT TO TELL ME WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO CROSS HIM SO UNUSUALLY AND TO LET ME SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM IF I COULD NOT HOPE TO ADVISE HIM BEFORE I HAD WELL CONCLUDED HE BEGAN TO LAUGHFRETFULLY AT FIRST BUT SOON WITH RETURNING GAIETY TUT ITS NOTHING DAISY NOTHING HE REPLIED I TOLD YOU AT THE INN IN LONDON I AM HEAVY COMPANY FOR MYSELF SOMETIMES I HAVE BEEN A NIGHTMARE TO MYSELF JUST NOWMUST HAVE HAD ONE I THINK AT ODD DULL TIMES NURSERY TALES COME UP INTO THE MEMORY UNRECOGNIZED FOR WHAT THEY ARE I BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN CONFOUNDING MYSELF WITH THE BAD BOY WHO DIDNT CARE AND BECAME FOOD FOR LIONSA GRANDER KIND OF GOING TO THE DOGS I SUPPOSE WHAT OLD WOMEN CALL THE HORRORS HAVE BEEN CREEPING OVER ME FROM HEAD TO FOOT I HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF MYSELF YOU ARE AFRAID OF NOTHING ELSE I THINK SAID I PERHAPS NOT AND YET MAY HAVE ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID OF TOO HE ANSWERED WELL SO IT GOES BY I AM NOT ABOUT TO BE HIPPED AGAIN DAVID BUT I TELL YOU MY GOOD FELLOW ONCE MORE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR ME AND FOR MORE THAN ME IF I HAD HAD A STEADFAST AND JUDICIOUS FATHER HIS FACE WAS ALWAYS FULL OF EXPRESSION BUT I NEVER SAW IT EXPRESS SUCH A DARK KIND OF EARNESTNESS AS WHEN HE SAID THESE WORDS WITH HIS GLANCE BENT ON THE FIRE SO MUCH FOR THAT HE SAID MAKING AS IF HE TOSSED SOMETHING LIGHT INTO THE AIR WITH HIS HAND WHY BEING GONE I AM A MAN AGAIN LIKE MACBETH AND NOW FOR DINNER IF I HAVE NOT MACBETHLIKE BROKEN UP THE FEAST WITH MOST ADMIRED DISORDER DAISY BUT WHERE ARE THEY ALL I WONDER SAID I GOD KNOWS SAID STEERFORTH AFTER STROLLING TO THE FERRY LOOKING FOR YOU I STROLLED IN HERE AND FOUND THE PLACE DESERTED THAT SET ME THINKING AND YOU FOUND ME THINKING THE ADVENT OF MRS GUMMIDGE WITH A BASKET EXPLAINED HOW THE HOUSE HAD HAPPENED TO BE EMPTY SHE HAD HURRIED OUT TO BUY SOMETHING THAT WAS NEEDED AGAINST MR PEGGOTTYS RETURN WITH THE TIDE AND HAD LEFT THE DOOR OPEN IN THE MEANWHILE LEST HAM AND LITTLE EMLY WITH WHOM IT WAS AN EARLY NIGHT SHOULD COME HOME WHILE SHE WAS GONE STEERFORTH AFTER VERY MUCH IMPROVING MRS GUMMIDGES SPIRITS BY A CHEERFUL SALUTATION AND A JOCOSE EMBRACE TOOK MY ARM AND HURRIED ME AWAY HE HAD IMPROVED HIS OWN SPIRITS NO LESS THAN MRS GUMMIDGES FOR THEY WERE AGAIN AT THEIR USUAL FLOW AND HE WAS FULL OF VIVACIOUS CONVERSATION AS WE WENT ALONG AND SO HE SAID GAILY WE ABANDON THIS BUCCANEER LIFE TOMORROW DO WE SO WE AGREED I RETURNED AND OUR PLACES BY THE COACH ARE TAKEN YOU KNOW AY THERES NO HELP FOR IT I SUPPOSE SAID STEERFORTH I HAVE ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT THERE IS ANYTHING TO DO IN THE WORLD BUT TO GO OUT TOSSING ON THE SEA HERE I WISH THERE WAS NOT AS LONG AS THE NOVELTY SHOULD LAST SAID I LAUGHING LIKE ENOUGH HE RETURNED THOUGH THERES A SARCASTIC MEANING IN THAT OBSERVATION FOR AN AMIABLE PIECE OF INNOCENCE LIKE MY YOUNG FRIEND WELL I DARE SAY I AM A CAPRICIOUS FELLOW DAVID I KNOW I AM BUT WHILE THE IRON IS HOT I CAN STRIKE IT VIGOROUSLY TOO I COULD PASS A REASONABLY GOOD EXAMINATION ALREADY AS A PILOT IN THESE WATERS I THINK MR PEGGOTTY SAYS YOU ARE A WONDER I RETURNED A NAUTICAL PHENOMENON EH LAUGHED STEERFORTH INDEED HE DOES AND YOU KNOW HOW TRULY I KNOW HOW ARDENT YOU ARE IN ANY PURSUIT YOU FOLLOW AND HOW EASILY YOU CAN MASTER IT AND THAT AMAZES ME MOST IN YOU STEERFORTHTHAT YOU SHOULD BE CONTENTED WITH SUCH FITFUL USES OF YOUR POWERS CONTENTED HE ANSWERED MERRILY I AM NEVER CONTENTED EXCEPT WITH YOUR FRESHNESS MY GENTLE DAISY AS TO FITFULNESS I HAVE NEVER LEARNT THE ART OF BINDING MYSELF TO ANY OF THE WHEELS ON WHICH THE IXIONS OF THESE DAYS ARE TURNING ROUND AND ROUND I MISSED IT SOMEHOW IN A BAD APPRENTICESHIP AND NOW DONT CARE ABOUT ITYOU KNOW I HAVE BOUGHT A BOAT DOWN HERE WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY FELLOW YOU ARE STEERFORTH I EXCLAIMED STOPPINGFOR THIS WAS THE FIRST I HAD HEARD OF IT WHEN YOU MAY NEVER CARE TO COME NEAR

PEGGOTTY WILL BE MASTER OF HER IN MY ABSENCE NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU STEERFORTH SAID I EXULTINGLY YOU PRETEND TO HAVE BOUGHT IT FOR YOURSELF BUT YOU HAVE REALLY DONE SO TO CONFER A BENEFIT ON HIM I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN AS MUCH AT FIRST KNOWING YOU MY DEAR KIND STEERFORTH HOW CAN I TELL YOU WHAT I THINK OF YOUR GENEROSITY TUSH HE ANSWERED TURNING RED THE LESS SAID THE BETTER DIDNT I KNOW CRIED I DIDNT I SAY THAT THERE WAS NOT A JOY OR SORROW OR ANY EMOTION OF SUCH HONEST HEARTS THAT WAS INDIFFERENT TO YOU AYE AYE HE ANSWERED YOU TOLD ME ALL THAT THERE LET IT REST WE HAVE SAID ENOUGH AFRAID OF OFFENDING HIM BY PURSUING THE SUBJECT WHEN HE MADE SO LIGHT OF IT I ONLY PURSUED IT IN MY THOUGHTS AS WE WENT ON AT EVEN A QUICKER PACE THAN BEFORE SHE MUST BE NEWLY RIGGED SAID STEERFORTH AND I SHALL LEAVE LITTIMER BEHIND TO SEE IT DONE THAT I MAY KNOW SHE IS QUITE COMPLETE DID I TELL YOU LITTIMER HAD COME DOWN NO OH YES CAME DOWN THIS MORNING WITH A LETTER FROM MY MOTHER AS OUR LOOKS MET I OBSERVED THAT HE WAS PALE EVEN TO HIS LIPS THOUGH HE LOOKED VERY STEADILY AT ME I FEARED THAT SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS MOTHER MIGHT HAVE LED TO HIS BEING IN THE FRAME OF MIND IN WHICH I HAD FOUND HIM AT THE SOLITARY FIRESIDE I HINTED SO OH NO HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AND GIVING A SLIGHT LAUGH NOTHING OF THE SORT YES HE IS COME DOWN THAT MAN OF MINE THE SAME AS EVER SAID I THE SAME AS EVER SAID STEERFORTH DISTANT AND QUIET AS THE NORTH POLE HE SHALL SEE TO THE BOAT BEING FRESH NAMED SHES THE STORMY PETREL NOW WHAT DOES MR PEGGOTTY CARE FOR STORMY PETRELS ILL HAVE HER CHRISTENED AGAIN BY WHAT NAME I ASKED THE LITTLE EMLY AS HE HAD CONTINUED TO LOOK STEADILY AT ME I TOOK IT AS A REMINDER THAT HE OBJECTED TO BEING EXTOLLED FOR HIS CONSIDERATION I COULD NOT HELP SHOWING IN MY FACE HOW MUCH IT PLEASED ME BUT I SAID LITTLE AND HE RESUMED HIS USUAL SMILE AND SEEMED RELIEVED BUT SEE HERE HE SAID LOOKING BEFORE US WHERE THE ORIGINAL LITTLE EMLY COMES AND THAT FELLOW WITH HER EH UPON MY SOUL HES A TRUE KNIGHT HE NEVER LEAVES HER HAM WAS A BOATBUILDER IN THESE DAYS HAVING IMPROVED A NATURAL INGENUITY IN THAT HANDICRAFT UNTIL HE HAD BECOME A SKILLED WORKMAN HE WAS IN HIS WORKINGDRESS AND LOOKED RUGGED ENOUGH BUT MANLY WITHAL AND A VERY FIT PROTECTOR FOR THE BLOOMING LITTLE CREATURE AT HIS SIDE INDEED THERE WAS A FRANKNESS IN HIS FACE AN HONESTY AND AN UNDISGUISED SHOW OF HIS PRIDE IN HER AND HIS LOVE FOR HER WHICH WERE TO ME THE BEST OF GOOD LOOKS I THOUGHT AS THEY CAME TOWARDS US THAT THEY WERE WELL MATCHED EVEN IN THAT PARTICULAR SHE WITHDREW HER HAND TIMIDLY FROM HIS ARM AS WE STOPPED TO SPEAK TO THEM AND BLUSHED AS SHE GAVE IT TO STEERFORTH AND TO ME WHEN THEY PASSED ON AFTER WE HAD EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS SHE DID NOT LIKE TO REPLACE THAT HAND BUT STILL APPEARING TIMID AND CONSTRAINED WALKED BY HERSELF I THOUGHT ALL THIS VERY PRETTY AND ENGAGING AND STEERFORTH SEEMED TO THINK SO TOO AS WE LOOKED AFTER THEM FADING AWAY IN THE LIGHT OF A YOUNG MOON SUDDENLY THERE PASSED USEVIDENTLY FOLLOWING THEMA YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE APPROACH WE HAD NOT OBSERVED BUT WHOSE FACE I SAW AS SHE WENT BY AND THOUGHT I HAD A FAINT REMEMBRANCE OF SHE WAS LIGHTLY DRESSED LOOKED BOLD AND HAGGARD AND FLAUNTING AND POOR BUT SEEMED FOR THE TIME TO HAVE GIVEN ALL THAT TO THE WIND WHICH WAS BLOWING AND TO HAVE NOTHING IN HER MIND BUT GOING AFTER THEM AS THE DARK DISTANT LEVEL ABSORBING THEIR FIGURES INTO ITSELF LEFT BUT ITSELF VISIBLE BETWEEN US AND THE SEA AND CLOUDS HER FIGURE DISAPPEARED IN LIKE MANNER STILL NO NEARER TO THEM THAN BEFORE THAT IS A BLACK SHADOW TO BE FOLLOWING THE GIRL SAID STEERFORTH STANDING STILL WHAT DOES IT MEAN HE SPOKE IN A LOW VOICE THAT SOUNDED ALMOST STRANGE TO ME SHE MUST HAVE IT IN HER MIND TO BEG OF THEM I THINK SAID I A BEGGAR WOULD BE NO NOVELTY SAID STEERFORTH BUT IT IS A STRANGE THING THAT THE BEGGAR SHOULD TAKE THAT SHAPE TONIGHT WHY I ASKED FOR NO BETTER REASON TRULY THAN BECAUSE I WAS THINKING HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE OF SOMETHING LIKE IT WHEN IT CAME BY WHERE THE DEVIL DID IT COME FROM I WONDER FROM THE SHADOW OF THIS WALL I THINK SAID I AS WE EMERGED UPON A ROAD ON WHICH A WALL ABUTTED ITS GONE HE RETURNED LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER AND ALL ILL GO WITH IT NOW FOR OUR DINNER BUT HE LOOKED AGAIN OVER HIS SHOULDER TOWARDS THE SEALINE GLIMMERING AFAR OFF AND YET AGAIN AND HE WONDERED ABOUT IT IN SOME BROKEN EXPRESSIONS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE SHORT REMAINDER OF OUR WALK AND ONLY SEEMED TO FORGET IT WHEN THE LIGHT OF FIRE AND CANDLE SHONE UPON US SEATED WARM AND MERRY AT TABLE LITTIMER WAS THERE AND HAD HIS USUAL EFFECT UPON ME WHEN I SAID TO HIM THAT I HOPED MRS STEERFORTH AND MISS DARTLE WERE WELL HE ANSWERED RESPECTFULLY AND OF COURSE RESPECTABLY THAT THEY WERE TOLERABLY WELL HE THANKED ME AND HAD SENT THEIR COMPLIMENTS THIS WAS ALL AND YET HE SEEMED TO ME TO SAY AS PLAINLY AS A MAN COULD SAY YOU ARE VERY YOUNG SIR YOU ARE EXCEEDINGLY YOUNG WE HAD ALMOST FINISHED DINNER WHEN TAKING A STEP OR TWO TOWARDS THE TABLE FROM THE CORNER WHERE HE KEPT WATCH UPON US OR RATHER UPON ME AS I FELT HE SAID TO HIS MASTER I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR MISS MOWCHER IS DOWN HERE WHO CRIED STEERFORTH MUCH ASTONISHED

OBLIGED TO CONFESSI FELT ASHAMED EVEN OF BEING AT THIS DISADVANTAGE BEFORE LITTIMERTHAT MISS MOWCHER AND I WERE WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED THEN YOU SHALL KNOW HER SAID STEERFORTH FOR SHE IS ONE OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE WORLD WHEN MISS MOWCHER COMES SHOW HER IN I FELT SOME CURIOSITY AND EXCITEMENT ABOUT THIS LADY ESPECIALLY AS STEERFORTH BURST INTO A FIT OF LAUGHING WHEN I REFERRED TO HER AND POSITIVELY REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION OF WHICH I MADE HER THE SUBJECT I REMAINED THEREFORE IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE EXPECTATION UNTIL THE CLOTH HAD BEEN REMOVED SOME HALF AN HOUR AND WE WERE SITTING OVER OUR DECANTER OF WINE BEFORE THE FIRE WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND LITTIMER WITH HIS HABITUAL SERENITY QUITE UNDISTURBED ANNOUNCED MISS MOWCHER I LOOKED AT THE DOORWAY AND SAW NOTHING I WAS STILL LOOKING AT THE DOORWAY THINKING THAT MISS MOWCHER WAS A LONG WHILE MAKING HER APPEARANCE WHEN TO MY INFINITE ASTONISHMENT THERE CAME WADDLING ROUND A SOFA WHICH STOOD BETWEEN ME AND IT A PURSY DWARF OF ABOUT FORTY OR FORTYFIVE WITH A VERY LARGE HEAD AND FACE A PAIR OF ROGUISH GREY EYES AND SUCH EXTREMELY LITTLE ARMS THAT TO ENABLE HERSELF TO LAY A FINGER ARCHLY AGAINST HER SNUB NOSE AS SHE

SUPPLICATION WHICH IN ITS AGONY AND GRIEF WAS HALF A WOMANS HALF A CHILDS AS ALL HER MANNER WAS BEING IN THAT MORE NATURAL AND BETTER SUITED TO HER BEAUTY AS I THOUGHT THAN ANY OTHER MANNER COULD HAVE BEEN WEPT SILENTLY WHILE MY OLD NURSE HUSHED HER LIKE AN INFANT SHE GOT CALMER BY DEGREES AND THEN WE SOOTHED HER NOW TALKING ENCOURAGINGLY AND NOW JESTING A LITTLE WITH HER UNTIL SHE BEGAN TO RAISE

LEST HER UNCLE SHOULD WONDER WHEN SHE GOT HOME WHY HIS DARLING HAD BEEN CRYING I SAW HER DO THAT NIGHT WHAT I HAD NEVER SEEN HER DO BEFORE I SAW HER INNOCENTLY KISS HER CHOSEN HUSBAND ON THE CHEEK AND CREEP CLOSE TO HIS BLUFF FORM AS IF IT WERE HER BEST SUPPORT WHEN THEY WENT AWAY TOGETHER IN THE WANING MOONLIGHT AND I LOOKED AFTER THEM COMPARING THEIR DEPARTURE IN MY MIND WITH MARTHAS I SAW THAT SHE HELD HIS ARM WITH BOTH HER HANDS AND STILL KEPT CLOSE TO HIM CHAPTER I CORROBORATE MR DICK AND CHOOSE A PROFESSION WHEN I AWOKE IN THE MORNING I THOUGHT VERY MUCH OF LITTLE EMLY AND HER EMOTION LAST NIGHT AFTER MARTHA HAD LEFT I FELT AS IF I HAD COME INTO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE DOMESTIC WEAKNESSES AND TENDERNESSES IN A SACRED CONFIDENCE AND THAT TO DISCLOSE THEM EVEN TO STEERFORTH WOULD BE WRONG I HAD NO GENTLER FEELING TOWARDS ANYONE THAN TOWARDS THE PRETTY CREATURE WHO HAD BEEN MY PLAYMATE AND WHOM I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PERSUADED AND SHALL ALWAYS BE PERSUADED TO MY DYING DAY I THEN DEVOTEDLY LOVED THE REPETITION TO ANY EARSEVEN TO STEERFORTHSOF WHAT SHE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO REPRESS WHEN HER HEART LAY OPEN TO ME BY AN ACCIDENT I FELT WOULD BE A ROUGH DEED UNWORTHY OF MYSELF UNWORTHY OF THE LIGHT OF OUR PURE CHILDHOOD WHICH I ALWAYS SAW ENCIRCLING HER HEAD I MADE A RESOLUTION THEREFORE TO KEEP IT IN MY OWN BREAST AND THERE IT GAVE HER IMAGE A NEW GRACE WHILE WE WERE AT BREAKFAST A LETTER WAS DELIVERED TO ME FROM MY AUNT AS IT CONTAINED MATTER ON WHICH I THOUGHT STEERFORTH COULD ADVISE ME AS WELL AS ANYONE AND ON WHICH I KNEW I SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO CONSULT HIM I RESOLVED TO MAKE IT A SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION ON OUR JOURNEY HOME FOR THE PRESENT WE HAD ENOUGH TO DO IN TAKING LEAVE OF ALL OUR FRIENDS MR BARKIS WAS FAR FROM BEING THE LAST AMONG THEM IN HIS REGRET AT OUR DEPARTURE AND I BELIEVE WOULD EVEN HAVE OPENED THE BOX AGAIN AND SACRIFICED ANOTHER GUINEA IF IT WOULD HAVE KEPT US EIGHTANDFORTY HOURS IN YARMOUTH PEGGOTTY AND ALL HER FAMILY WERE FULL OF GRIEF AT OUR GOING THE WHOLE HOUSE OF OMER AND JORAM TURNED OUT TO BID US GOODBYE AND THERE WERE SO MANY SEAFARING VOLUNTEERS IN ATTENDANCE ON STEERFORTH WHEN OUR PORTMANTEAUX WENT TO THE COACH THAT IF WE HAD HAD THE BAGGAGE OF A REGIMENT WITH US WE SHOULD HARDLY HAVE WANTED PORTERS TO CARRY IT IN A WORD WE DEPARTED TO THE REGRET AND ADMIRATION OF ALL CONCERNED AND LEFT A GREAT MANY PEOPLE VERY SORRY BEHIND US DO YOU STAY LONG HERE LITTIMER SAID I AS HE STOOD WAITING TO SEE THE COACH START NO SIR HE REPLIED PROBABLY NOT VERY LONG SIR HE CAN HARDLY SAY JUST NOW OBSERVED STEERFORTH CARELESSLY HE KNOWS WHAT HE HAS TO DO AND HELL DO IT THAT I AM SURE HE WILL SAID I LITTIMER TOUCHED HIS HAT IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF MY GOOD OPINION AND I FELT ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD HE TOUCHED IT ONCE MORE WISHING US A GOOD JOURNEY AND WE LEFT HIM STANDING ON THE PAVEMENT AS RESPECTABLE A MYSTERY AS ANY PYRAMID IN EGYPT FOR SOME LITTLE TIME WE HELD NO CONVERSATION STEERFORTH BEING UNUSUALLY SILENT AND I BEING SUFFICIENTLY ENGAGED IN WONDERING WITHIN MYSELF WHEN I SHOULD SEE THE OLD PLACES AGAIN AND WHAT NEW CHANGES MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME OR THEM IN THE MEANWHILE AT LENGTH STEERFORTH BECOMING GAY AND TALKATIVE IN A MOMENT AS HE COULD BECOME ANYTHING HE LIKED AT ANY MOMENT PULLED ME BY THE ARM FIND A VOICE DAVID WHAT ABOUT THAT LETTER YOU WERE SPEAKING OF AT BREAKFAST OH SAID I TAKING IT OUT OF MY POCKET ITS FROM MY AUNT AND WHAT DOES SHE SAY REQUIRING CONSIDERATION WHY SHE REMINDS ME STEERFORTH SAID I THAT I CAME OUT ON THIS EXPEDITION TO LOOK ABOUT ME AND TO THINK A LITTLE WHICH OF COURSE YOU HAVE DONE INDEED I CANT SAY I HAVE PARTICULARLY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I AM AFRAID I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT WELL LOOK ABOUT YOU NOW AND MAKE UP FOR YOUR NEGLIGENCE SAID STEERFORTH LOOK TO THE RIGHT AND YOULL SEE A FLAT COUNTRY WITH A GOOD DEAL OF MARSH IN IT LOOK TO THE LEFT AND YOULL SEE THE SAME LOOK TO THE FRONT AND YOULL FIND NO DIFFERENCE LOOK TO THE REAR AND THERE IT IS STILL I LAUGHED AND REPLIED THAT I SAW NO SUITABLE PROFESSION IN THE WHOLE PROSPECT WHICH WAS PERHAPS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ITS FLATNESS WHAT SAYS OUR AUNT ON THE SUBJECT INQUIRED STEERFORTH GLANCING AT THE LETTER IN MY HAND DOES SHE SUGGEST ANYTHING WHY YES SAID I SHE ASKS ME HERE IF I THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO BE A PROCTOR WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT WELL I DONT KNOW REPLIED STEERFORTH COOLLY YOU MAY AS WELL DO THAT AS ANYTHING ELSE I SUPPOSE I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AGAIN AT HIS BALANCING ALL CALLINGS AND PROFESSIONS SO EQUALLY AND I TOLD HIM SO WHAT IS A PROCTOR STEERFORTH SAID I WHY HE IS A SORT OF MONKISH ATTORNEY REPLIED STEERFORTH HE IS TO SOME FADED COURTS HELD IN DOCTORS COMMONSA LAZY OLD NOOK NEAR ST PAULS CHURCHYARDWHAT SOLICITORS ARE TO THE COURTS OF LAW AND EQUITY HE IS A FUNCTIONARY WHOSE EXISTENCE IN THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS WOULD HAVE TERMINATED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO I CAN TELL YOU BEST WHAT HE IS BY TELLING YOU WHAT DOCTORS COMMONS IS ITS A LITTLE OUTOFTHEWAY PLACE WHERE THEY ADMINISTER WHAT IS CALLED ECCLESIASTICAL LAW AND PLAY ALL KINDS OF TRICKS WITH OBSOLETE OLD MONSTERS OF ACTS OF PARLIAMENT WHICH THREEFOURTHS OF THE WORLD KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AND THE OTHER FOURTH SUPPOSES TO HAVE BEEN DUG UP IN A FOSSIL STATE IN THE DAYS OF THE EDWARDS ITS A PLACE THAT HAS AN ANCIENT MONOPOLY IN SUITS ABOUT PEOPLES WILLS AND PEOPLES MARRIAGES AND DISPUTES AMONG SHIPS AND BOATS NONSENSE STEERFORTH I EXCLAIMED YOU DONT MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE IS ANY AFFINITY BETWEEN NAUTICAL MATTERS AND ECCLESIASTICAL MATTERS I DONT INDEED MY DEAR BOY HE RETURNED BUT I MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY ARE MANAGED AND DECIDED BY THE SAME SET OF PEOPLE DOWN IN THAT SAME DOCTORS COMMONS YOU SHALL GO THERE ONE DAY AND FIND THEM BLUNDERING THROUGH HALF THE NAUTICAL TERMS IN YOUNGS DICTIONARY APROPOS OF THE NANCY HAVING RUN DOWN THE SARAH JANE OR MR PEGGOTTY AND THE YARMOUTH BOATMEN HAVING PUT OFF IN A GALE OF WIND WITH AN ANCHOR AND CABLE TO THE NELSON INDIAMAN IN DISTRESS AND YOU SHALL GO THERE ANOTHER DAY AND FIND THEM DEEP IN THE EVIDENCE PRO AND CON RESPECTING A CLERGYMAN WHO HAS MISBEHAVED HIMSELF AND YOU SHALL FIND THE JUDGE IN THE NAUTICAL CASE THE ADVOCATE IN THE CLERGYMANS CASE OR CONTRARIWISE THEY ARE LIKE ACTORS NOW A MANS A JUDGE AND NOW HE IS NOT A JUDGE NOW HES ONE THING NOW HES ANOTHER NOW HES SOMETHING ELSE CHANGE AND CHANGE ABOUT BUT ITS ALWAYS A VERY PLEASANT PROFITABLE LITTLE AFFAIR OF PRIVATE THEATRICALS PRESENTED TO AN UNCOMMONLY SELECT AUDIENCE BUT ADVOCATES AND PROCTORS ARE NOT ONE AND THE SAME SAID I A LITTLE PUZZLED ARE THEY NO RETURNED STEERFORTH THE ADVOCATES ARE CIVILIANSMEN WHO HAVE TAKEN A DOCTORS DEGREE AT COLLEGEWHICH IS THE FIRST REASON OF MY KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT THE PROCTORS EMPLOY THE ADVOCATES BOTH GET VERY COMFORTABLE FEES AND ALTOGETHER THEY MAKE A MIGHTY SNUG LITTLE PARTY ON THE WHOLE I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO TAKE TO DOCTORS COMMONS KINDLY DAVID THEY PLUME THEMSELVES ON THEIR GENTILITY THERE I CAN TELL YOU IF THATS ANY SATISFACTION I MADE ALLOWANCE FOR STEERFORTHS LIGHT WAY OF TREATING THE SUBJECT AND CONSIDERING IT WITH REFERENCE TO THE STAID AIR OF GRAVITY AND ANTIQUITY WHICH I ASSOCIATED WITH THAT LAZY OLD NOOK NEAR ST PAULS CHURCHYARD DID NOT FEEL INDISPOSED TOWARDS MY AUNTS SUGGESTION WHICH SHE LEFT TO MY FREE DECISION MAKING NO SCRUPLE OF TELLING ME THAT IT HAD OCCURRED TO HER ON HER LATELY VISITING HER OWN PROCTOR IN DOCTORS COMMONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF SETTLING HER WILL IN MY FAVOUR THATS A LAUDABLE PROCEEDING ON THE PART OF OUR AUNT AT ALL EVENTS SAID STEERFORTH WHEN I MENTIONED IT AND ONE DESERVING OF ALL ENCOURAGEMENT DAISY MY ADVICE IS THAT YOU TAKE KINDLY TO DOCTORS COMMONS I QUITE MADE UP MY MIND TO DO SO I THEN TOLD STEERFORTH THAT MY AUNT WAS IN TOWN AWAITING ME AS I FOUND FROM HER LETTER AND THAT SHE HAD TAKEN LODGINGS FOR A WEEK AT A KIND OF PRIVATE HOTEL AT LINCOLNS INN FIELDS WHERE THERE WAS A STONE STAIRCASE AND A CONVENIENT DOOR IN THE ROOF MY AUNT BEING FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT EVERY HOUSE IN LONDON WAS GOING TO BE BURNT DOWN EVERY NIGHT WE ACHIEVED THE REST OF OUR JOURNEY PLEASANTLY SOMETIMES RECURRING TO DOCTORS COMMONS AND ANTICIPATING THE DISTANT DAYS WHEN I SHOULD BE A PROCTOR THERE WHICH STEERFORTH PICTURED IN A VARIETY OF HUMOROUS AND WHIMSICAL LIGHTS THAT MADE US BOTH MERRY WHEN WE CAME TO OUR JOURNEYS END HE WENT HOME ENGAGING TO CALL UPON ME NEXT DAY BUT ONE AND I DROVE TO LINCOLNS INN FIELDS WHERE I FOUND MY AUNT UP AND WAITING SUPPER IF I HAD BEEN ROUND THE WORLD SINCE WE PARTED WE COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN BETTER PLEASED TO MEET AGAIN MY AUNT CRIED OUTRIGHT AS SHE EMBRACED ME AND SAID PRETENDING TO LAUGH THAT IF MY POOR MOTHER HAD BEEN ALIVE THAT SILLY LITTLE CREATURE WOULD HAVE SHED TEARS SHE HAD NO DOUBT SO YOU HAVE LEFT MR DICK BEHIND AUNT SAID I I AM SORRY FOR THAT AH JANET HOW DO YOU DO AS JANET CURTSIED HOPING I WAS WELL I OBSERVED MY AUNTS VISAGE LENGTHEN VERY MUCH I AM SORRY FOR IT TOO SAID MY AUNT RUBBING HER NOSE I HAVE HAD NO PEACE OF MIND TROT SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE I COULD ASK WHY SHE TOLD ME I AM CONVINCED SAID MY AUNT LAYING HER HAND WITH MELANCHOLY FIRMNESS ON THE TABLE THAT DICKS CHARACTER IS NOT A CHARACTER TO KEEP THE DONKEYS OFF I AM CONFIDENT HE WANTS STRENGTH OF PURPOSE I OUGHT TO HAVE LEFT JANET AT HOME INSTEAD AND THEN MY MIND MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN AT EASE IF EVER THERE WAS A DONKEY TRESPASSING ON MY GREEN SAID MY AUNT WITH EMPHASIS THERE WAS ONE THIS AFTERNOON AT FOUR OCLOCK A COLD FEELING CAME OVER ME FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND I KNOW IT WAS A DONKEY I TRIED TO COMFORT HER ON THIS POINT BUT SHE REJECTED CONSOLATION IT WAS A DONKEY SAID MY AUNT AND IT WAS THE ONE WITH THE STUMPY TAIL WHICH THAT MURDERING SISTER OF A WOMAN RODE WHEN SHE CAME TO MY HOUSE THIS HAD BEEN EVER SINCE THE ONLY NAME MY AUNT KNEW FOR MISS MURDSTONE IF THERE IS ANY DONKEY IN DOVER WHOSE AUDACITY IT IS HARDER TO ME TO BEAR THAN ANOTHERS THAT SAID MY AUNT STRIKING THE TABLE IS THE ANIMAL JANET VENTURED TO SUGGEST THAT MY AUNT MIGHT BE DISTURBING HERSELF UNNECESSARILY AND THAT SHE BELIEVED THE DONKEY IN QUESTION WAS THEN ENGAGED IN THE SANDANDGRAVEL LINE OF BUSINESS AND WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR PURPOSES OF TRESPASS BUT MY AUNT WOULDNT HEAR OF IT SUPPER WAS COMFORTABLY SERVED AND HOT THOUGH MY AUNTS ROOMS WERE VERY HIGH UPWHETHER THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE MORE STONE STAIRS FOR HER MONEY OR MIGHT BE NEARER TO THE DOOR IN THE ROOF I DONT KNOWAND CONSISTED OF A ROAST FOWL A STEAK AND SOME VEGETABLES TO ALL OF WHICH I DID AMPLE JUSTICE AND WHICH WERE ALL EXCELLENT BUT MY AUNT HAD HER OWN IDEAS CONCERNING LONDON PROVISION AND ATE BUT LITTLE I SUPPOSE THIS UNFORTUNATE FOWL WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP IN A CELLAR SAID MY AUNT AND NEVER TOOK THE AIR EXCEPT ON A HACKNEY COACHSTAND I HOPE THE STEAK MAY BE BEEF BUT I DONT BELIEVE IT NOTHINGS GENUINE IN THE PLACE IN MY OPINION BUT THE DIRT DONT YOU THINK THE FOWL MAY HAVE COME OUT OF THE COUNTRY AUNT I HINTED CERTAINLY NOT RETURNED MY AUNT IT WOULD BE NO PLEASURE TO A LONDON TRADESMAN TO SELL ANYTHING WHICH WAS WHAT HE PRETENDED IT WAS I DID NOT VENTURE TO CONTROVERT THIS OPINION BUT I MADE A GOOD SUPPER WHICH IT GREATLY SATISFIED HER TO SEE ME DO WHEN THE TABLE WAS CLEARED JANET ASSISTED HER TO ARRANGE HER HAIR TO PUT ON HER NIGHTCAP WHICH WAS OF A SMARTER CONSTRUCTION THAN USUAL IN CASE OF FIRE MY AUNT SAID AND TO FOLD HER GOWN BACK OVER HER KNEES THESE BEING HER USUAL PREPARATIONS FOR WARMING HERSELF BEFORE GOING TO BED I THEN MADE HER ACCORDING TO CERTAIN ESTABLISHED REGULATIONS FROM WHICH NO DEVIATION HOWEVER SLIGHT COULD EVER BE PERMITTED A GLASS OF HOT WINE AND WATER AND A SLICE OF TOAST CUT INTO LONG THIN STRIPS WITH THESE ACCOMPANIMENTS WE WERE LEFT ALONE TO FINISH THE EVENING MY AUNT SITTING OPPOSITE TO ME DRINKING HER WINE AND WATER SOAKING HER STRIPS OF TOAST IN IT ONE BY ONE BEFORE EATING THEM AND LOOKING BENIGNANTLY ON ME FROM AMONG THE BORDERS OF HER NIGHTCAP WELL TROT SHE BEGAN WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PROCTOR

BREAKFAST TOMORROW WE HAD A LONG CHAT BY THE FIRE BEFORE WE WENT TO BED I SLEPT IN A ROOM ON THE SAME FLOOR WITH MY AUNTS AND WAS A LITTLE DISTURBED IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT BY HER KNOCKING AT MY DOOR AS OFTEN AS SHE WAS AGITATED BY A DISTANT SOUND OF HACKNEYCOACHES OR MARKETCARTS AND INQUIRING IF I HEARD THE ENGINES BUT TOWARDS MORNING SHE SLEPT BETTER AND SUFFERED ME TO DO SO TOO AT ABOUT MIDDAY WE SET OUT FOR THE OFFICE OF MESSRS SPENLOW AND JORKINS IN DOCTORS COMMONS MY AUNT WHO HAD THIS OTHER GENERAL OPINION IN REFERENCE TO LONDON THAT EVERY MAN SHE SAW WAS A PICKPOCKET GAVE ME HER PURSE TO CARRY FOR HER WHICH HAD TEN GUINEAS IN IT AND SOME SILVER WE MADE A PAUSE AT THE TOY SHOP IN FLEET STREET TO SEE THE GIANTS OF SAINT DUNSTANS STRIKE UPON THE BELLSWE HAD TIMED OUR GOING SO AS TO CATCH THEM AT IT AT TWELVE OCLOCKAND THEN WENT ON TOWARDS LUDGATE HILL AND ST PAULS CHURCHYARD WE WERE CROSSING TO THE FORMER PLACE WHEN I FOUND THAT MY AUNT GREATLY ACCELERATED HER SPEED AND LOOKED FRIGHTENED I OBSERVED AT THE SAME TIME THAT A LOWERING ILLDRESSED MAN WHO HAD STOPPED AND STARED AT US IN PASSING A LITTLE BEFORE WAS COMING SO CLOSE AFTER US AS TO BRUSH AGAINST HER TROT MY DEAR TROT CRIED MY AUNT IN A TERRIFIED WHISPER AND PRESSING MY ARM I DONT KNOW WHAT I AM TO DO DONT BE ALARMED SAID I THERES NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF STEP INTO A SHOP AND ILL SOON GET RID OF THIS FELLOW NO NO CHILD SHE RETURNED DONT SPEAK TO HIM FOR THE WORLD I ENTREAT I ORDER YOU GOOD HEAVEN AUNT SAID I HE IS NOTHING BUT A STURDY BEGGAR YOU DONT KNOW WHAT HE IS REPLIED MY AUNT YOU DONT KNOW WHO HE IS YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU SAY WE HAD STOPPED IN AN EMPTY DOORWAY WHILE THIS WAS PASSING AND HE HAD STOPPED TOO DONT LOOK AT HIM SAID MY AUNT AS I TURNED MY HEAD INDIGNANTLY BUT GET ME A COACH MY DEAR AND WAIT FOR ME IN ST PAULS CHURCHYARD WAIT FOR YOU I REPLIED YES REJOINED MY AUNT I MUST GO ALONE I MUST GO WITH HIM WITH HIM AUNT THIS MAN I AM IN MY SENSES SHE REPLIED AND I TELL YOU I MUST GET ME A COACH HOWEVER MUCH ASTONISHED I MIGHT BE I WAS SENSIBLE THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO REFUSE COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH A PEREMPTORY COMMAND I HURRIED AWAY A FEW PACES AND CALLED A HACKNEYCHARIOT WHICH WAS PASSING EMPTY ALMOST BEFORE I COULD LET DOWN THE STEPS MY AUNT SPRANG IN I DONT KNOW HOW AND THE MAN FOLLOWED SHE WAVED HER HAND TO ME TO GO AWAY SO EARNESTLY THAT ALL CONFOUNDED AS I WAS I TURNED FROM THEM AT ONCE IN DOING SO I HEARD HER SAY TO THE COACHMAN DRIVE ANYWHERE DRIVE STRAIGHT ON AND PRESENTLY THE CHARIOT PASSED ME GOING UP THE HILL WHAT MR DICK HAD TOLD ME AND WHAT I HAD SUPPOSED TO BE A DELUSION OF HIS NOW CAME INTO MY MIND I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT THIS PERSON WAS THE PERSON OF WHOM HE HAD MADE SUCH MYSTERIOUS MENTION THOUGH WHAT THE NATURE OF HIS HOLD UPON MY AUNT COULD POSSIBLY BE I WAS QUITE UNABLE TO IMAGINE AFTER HALF AN HOURS COOLING IN THE CHURCHYARD I SAW THE CHARIOT COMING BACK THE DRIVER STOPPED BESIDE ME AND MY AUNT WAS SITTING IN IT ALONE SHE HAD NOT YET SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED FROM HER AGITATION TO BE QUITE PREPARED FOR THE VISIT WE HAD TO MAKE SHE DESIRED ME TO GET INTO THE CHARIOT AND TO TELL THE COACHMAN TO DRIVE SLOWLY UP AND DOWN A LITTLE WHILE SHE SAID NO MORE EXCEPT MY DEAR CHILD NEVER ASK ME WHAT IT WAS AND DONT REFER TO IT UNTIL SHE HAD PERFECTLY REGAINED HER COMPOSURE WHEN SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS QUITE HERSELF NOW AND WE MIGHT GET OUT ON HER GIVING ME HER PURSE TO PAY THE DRIVER I FOUND THAT ALL THE GUINEAS WERE GONE AND ONLY THE LOOSE SILVER REMAINED DOCTORS COMMONS WAS APPROACHED BY A LITTLE LOW ARCHWAY BEFORE WE HAD TAKEN MANY PACES DOWN THE STREET BEYOND IT THE NOISE OF THE CITY SEEMED TO MELT AS IF BY MAGIC INTO A SOFTENED DISTANCE A FEW DULL COURTS AND NARROW WAYS BROUGHT US TO THE SKYLIGHTED OFFICES OF SPENLOW AND JORKINS IN THE VESTIBULE OF WHICH TEMPLE ACCESSIBLE TO PILGRIMS WITHOUT THE CEREMONY OF KNOCKING THREE OR FOUR CLERKS WERE AT WORK AS COPYISTS ONE OF THESE A LITTLE DRY MAN SITTING BY HIMSELF WHO WORE A STIFF BROWN WIG THAT LOOKED AS IF IT WERE MADE OF GINGERBREAD ROSE TO RECEIVE MY AUNT AND SHOW US INTO MR SPENLOWS ROOM MR SPENLOWS IN COURT MAAM SAID THE DRY MAN ITS AN ARCHES DAY BUT ITS CLOSE BY AND ILL SEND FOR HIM DIRECTLY AS WE WERE LEFT TO LOOK ABOUT US WHILE MR SPENLOW WAS FETCHED I AVAILED MYSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITY THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM WAS OLDFASHIONED AND DUSTY AND THE GREEN BAIZE ON THE TOP OF THE WRITINGTABLE HAD LOST ALL ITS COLOUR AND WAS AS WITHERED AND PALE AS AN OLD PAUPER THERE WERE A GREAT MANY BUNDLES OF PAPERS ON IT SOME ENDORSED AS ALLEGATIONS AND SOME TO MY SURPRISE AS LIBELS AND SOME AS BEING IN THE CONSISTORY COURT AND SOME IN THE ARCHES COURT AND SOME IN THE PREROGATIVE COURT AND SOME IN THE ADMIRALTY COURT AND SOME IN THE DELEGATES COURT GIVING ME OCCASION TO WONDER MUCH HOW MANY COURTS THERE MIGHT BE IN THE GROSS AND HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO UNDERSTAND THEM ALL BESIDES THESE THERE WERE SUNDRY IMMENSE MANUSCRIPT BOOKS OF EVIDENCE TAKEN ON AFFIDAVIT STRONGLY BOUND AND TIED TOGETHER IN MASSIVE SETS A SET TO EACH CAUSE AS IF EVERY CAUSE WERE A HISTORY IN TEN OR TWENTY VOLUMES ALL THIS LOOKED TOLERABLY EXPENSIVE I THOUGHT AND GAVE ME AN AGREEABLE NOTION OF A PROCTORS BUSINESS I WAS CASTING MY EYES WITH INCREASING COMPLACENCY OVER THESE AND MANY SIMILAR OBJECTS WHEN HASTY FOOTSTEPS WERE HEARD IN THE ROOM OUTSIDE AND MR SPENLOW IN A BLACK GOWN TRIMMED WITH WHITE FUR CAME HURRYING IN TAKING OFF HIS HAT AS HE CAME HE WAS A LITTLE LIGHTHAIRED GENTLEMAN WITH UNDENIABLE BOOTS AND THE STIFFEST OF WHITE CRAVATS AND SHIRTCOLLARS HE WAS BUTTONED UP MIGHTY TRIM AND TIGHT AND MUST HAVE TAKEN A GREAT DEAL OF PAINS WITH HIS WHISKERS WHICH WERE ACCURATELY CURLED HIS GOLD WATCHCHAIN WAS SO MASSIVE THAT A FANCY CAME ACROSS ME THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE A SINEWY GOLDEN ARM TO DRAW IT OUT WITH LIKE THOSE WHICH ARE PUT UP OVER THE GOLDBEATERS SHOPS HE WAS GOT UP WITH SUCH CARE AND WAS SO STIFF THAT HE COULD HARDLY BEND HIMSELF BEING OBLIGED WHEN HE GLANCED AT SOME PAPERS ON HIS DESK AFTER SITTING DOWN IN HIS CHAIR TO MOVE HIS WHOLE BODY FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS SPINE LIKE PUNCH I HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN PRESENTED BY MY AUNT AND HAD BEEN COURTEOUSLY RECEIVED HE NOW SAID AND SO MR COPPERFIELD YOU THINK OF ENTERING INTO OUR PROFESSION I CASUALLY MENTIONED TO MISS TROTWOOD WHEN I HAD THE PLEASURE OF AN INTERVIEW WITH HER THE OTHER DAYWITH ANOTHER INCLINATION OF HIS BODYPUNCH AGAINTHAT THERE WAS A VACANCY HERE MISS TROTWOOD WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO MENTION THAT SHE HAD A NEPHEW WHO WAS HER PECULIAR CARE AND FOR WHOM SHE WAS SEEKING TO PROVIDE GENTEELLY IN LIFE THAT NEPHEW I BELIEVE I HAVE NOW THE PLEASURE OFPUNCH AGAIN I BOWED MY ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND SAID MY AUNT HAD MENTIONED TO ME THAT THERE WAS THAT OPENING AND THAT I BELIEVED I SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH THAT I WAS STRONGLY INCLINED TO LIKE IT AND HAD TAKEN IMMEDIATELY TO THE PROPOSAL THAT I COULD NOT ABSOLUTELY PLEDGE MYSELF TO LIKE IT UNTIL I KNEW SOMETHING MORE ABOUT IT THAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS LITTLE ELSE THAN A MATTER OF FORM I PRESUMED I SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING HOW I LIKED IT BEFORE I BOUND MYSELF TO IT IRREVOCABLY OH SURELY SURELY SAID MR SPENLOW WE ALWAYS IN THIS HOUSE PROPOSE A MONTHAN INITIATORY MONTH I SHOULD BE HAPPY MYSELF TO PROPOSE TWO MONTHSTHREEAN INDEFINITE PERIOD IN FACTBUT I HAVE A PARTNER MR JORKINS AND THE PREMIUM SIR I RETURNED IS A THOUSAND POUNDS AND THE PREMIUM STAMP INCLUDED IS A THOUSAND POUNDS SAID MR SPENLOW AS I HAVE MENTIONED TO MISS TROTWOOD I AM ACTUATED BY NO MERCENARY CONSIDERATIONS FEW MEN ARE LESS SO I BELIEVE BUT MR JORKINS HAS HIS OPINIONS ON THESE SUBJECTS AND I AM BOUND TO RESPECT MR JORKINSS OPINIONS MR JORKINS THINKS A THOUSAND POUNDS TOO LITTLE IN SHORT I SUPPOSE SIR SAID I STILL DESIRING TO SPARE MY AUNT THAT IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM HERE IF AN ARTICLED CLERK WERE PARTICULARLY USEFUL AND MADE HIMSELF A PERFECT MASTER OF HIS PROFESSIONI COULD NOT HELP BLUSHING THIS LOOKED SO LIKE PRAISING MYSELFI SUPPOSE IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM IN THE LATER YEARS OF HIS TIME TO ALLOW HIM ANY MR SPENLOW BY A GREAT EFFORT JUST LIFTED HIS HEAD FAR ENOUGH OUT OF HIS CRAVAT TO SHAKE IT AND ANSWERED ANTICIPATING THE WORD SALARY NO I WILL NOT SAY WHAT CONSIDERATION I MIGHT GIVE TO THAT POINT MYSELF MR COPPERFIELD IF I WERE UNFETTERED MR JORKINS IS IMMOVABLE I WAS QUITE DISMAYED BY THE IDEA OF THIS TERRIBLE JORKINS BUT I FOUND OUT AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS A MILD MAN OF A HEAVY TEMPERAMENT WHOSE PLACE IN THE BUSINESS WAS TO KEEP HIMSELF IN THE BACKGROUND AND BE CONSTANTLY EXHIBITED BY NAME AS THE MOST OBDURATE AND RUTHLESS OF MEN IF A CLERK WANTED HIS SALARY RAISED MR JORKINS WOULDNT LISTEN TO SUCH A PROPOSITION IF A CLIENT WERE SLOW TO SETTLE HIS BILL OF COSTS MR JORKINS WAS RESOLVED TO HAVE IT PAID AND HOWEVER PAINFUL THESE THINGS MIGHT BE AND ALWAYS WERE TO THE FEELINGS OF MR SPENLOW MR JORKINS WOULD HAVE HIS BOND THE HEART AND HAND OF THE GOOD ANGEL SPENLOW WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS OPEN BUT FOR THE RESTRAINING DEMON JORKINS AS I HAVE GROWN OLDER I THINK I HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE OF SOME OTHER HOUSES DOING BUSINESS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF SPENLOW AND JORKINS IT WAS SETTLED THAT I SHOULD BEGIN MY MONTHS PROBATION AS SOON AS I PLEASED AND THAT MY AUNT NEED NEITHER REMAIN IN TOWN NOR RETURN AT ITS EXPIRATION AS THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT OF WHICH I WAS TO BE THE SUBJECT COULD EASILY BE SENT TO HER AT HOME FOR HER SIGNATURE WHEN WE HAD GOT SO FAR MR SPENLOW OFFERED TO TAKE ME INTO COURT THEN AND THERE AND SHOW ME WHAT SORT OF PLACE IT WAS AS I WAS WILLING ENOUGH TO KNOW WE WENT OUT WITH THIS OBJECT LEAVING MY AUNT BEHIND WHO WOULD TRUST HERSELF SHE SAID IN NO SUCH PLACE AND WHO I THINK REGARDED ALL COURTS OF LAW AS A SORT OF POWDERMILLS THAT MIGHT BLOW UP AT ANY TIME MR SPENLOW CONDUCTED ME THROUGH A PAVED COURTYARD FORMED OF GRAVE BRICK HOUSES WHICH I INFERRED FROM THE DOCTORS NAMES UPON THE DOORS TO BE THE OFFICIAL ABIDINGPLACES OF THE LEARNED ADVOCATES OF WHOM STEERFORTH HAD TOLD ME AND INTO A LARGE DULL ROOM NOT UNLIKE A CHAPEL TO MY THINKING ON THE LEFT HAND THE UPPER PART OF THIS ROOM WAS FENCED OFF FROM THE REST AND THERE ON THE TWO SIDES OF A RAISED PLATFORM OF THE HORSESHOE FORM SITTING ON EASY OLDFASHIONED DININGROOM CHAIRS WERE SUNDRY GENTLEMEN IN RED GOWNS AND GREY WIGS WHOM I FOUND TO BE THE DOCTORS AFORESAID BLINKING OVER A LITTLE DESK LIKE A PULPITDESK IN THE CURVE OF THE HORSESHOE WAS AN OLD GENTLEMAN WHOM IF I HAD SEEN HIM IN AN AVIARY I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN FOR AN OWL BUT WHO I LEARNED WAS THE PRESIDING JUDGE IN THE SPACE WITHIN THE HORSESHOE LOWER THAN THESE THAT IS TO SAY ON ABOUT THE LEVEL OF THE FLOOR WERE SUNDRY OTHER GENTLEMEN OF MR SPENLOWS RANK AND DRESSED LIKE HIM IN BLACK GOWNS WITH WHITE FUR UPON THEM SITTING AT A LONG GREEN TABLE THEIR CRAVATS WERE IN GENERAL STIFF I THOUGHT AND THEIR LOOKS HAUGHTY BUT IN THIS LAST RESPECT I PRESENTLY CONCEIVED I HAD DONE THEM AN INJUSTICE FOR WHEN TWO OR THREE OF THEM HAD TO RISE AND ANSWER A QUESTION OF THE PRESIDING DIGNITARY I NEVER SAW ANYTHING MORE SHEEPISH THE PUBLIC REPRESENTED BY A BOY WITH A COMFORTER AND A SHABBYGENTEEL MAN SECRETLY EATING CRUMBS OUT OF HIS COAT POCKETS WAS WARMING ITSELF AT A STOVE IN THE CENTRE OF THE COURT THE LANGUID STILLNESS OF THE PLACE WAS ONLY BROKEN BY THE CHIRPING OF THIS FIRE AND BY THE VOICE OF ONE OF THE DOCTORS WHO WAS WANDERING SLOWLY THROUGH A PERFECT LIBRARY OF EVIDENCE AND STOPPING TO PUT UP FROM TIME TO TIME AT LITTLE ROADSIDE INNS OF ARGUMENT ON THE JOURNEY ALTOGETHER I HAVE NEVER ON ANY OCCASION MADE ONE AT SUCH A COSEY DOSEY OLDFASHIONED TIMEFORGOTTEN SLEEPYHEADED LITTLE FAMILYPARTY IN ALL MY LIFE AND I FELT IT WOULD BE QUITE A SOOTHING OPIATE TO BELONG TO IT IN ANY CHARACTEREXCEPT PERHAPS AS A SUITOR VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH THE DREAMY NATURE OF THIS RETREAT I INFORMED MR SPENLOW THAT I HAD SEEN ENOUGH FOR THAT TIME AND WE REJOINED MY AUNT IN COMPANY WITH WHOM I PRESENTLY DEPARTED FROM THE COMMONS FEELING VERY YOUNG WHEN I WENT OUT OF SPENLOW AND JORKINSS ON ACCOUNT OF THE CLERKS POKING ONE ANOTHER WITH THEIR PENS TO POINT ME OUT WE ARRIVED AT LINCOLNS INN FIELDS WITHOUT ANY NEW ADVENTURES EXCEPT ENCOUNTERING AN UNLUCKY DONKEY IN A COSTERMONGERS CART WHO SUGGESTED PAINFUL ASSOCIATIONS TO MY AUNT WE HAD ANOTHER LONG TALK ABOUT MY PLANS WHEN WE WERE SAFELY HOUSED AND AS I KNEW SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET HOME AND BETWEEN FIRE FOOD AND PICKPOCKETS COULD NEVER BE CONSIDERED AT HER EASE FOR HALFANHOUR IN LONDON I URGED HER NOT TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE ON MY ACCOUNT BUT TO LEAVE ME TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I HAVE NOT BEEN HERE A WEEK TOMORROW WITHOUT CONSIDERING THAT TOO MY DEAR SHE RETURNED THERE IS A FURNISHED LITTLE SET OF CHAMBERS TO BE LET IN THE ADELPHI TROT WHICH OUGHT TO SUIT YOU TO A MARVEL WITH THIS BRIEF INTRODUCTION SHE PRODUCED FROM HER POCKET AN ADVERTISEMENT CAREFULLY CUT OUT OF A NEWSPAPER SETTING FORTH THAT IN BUCKINGHAM STREET IN THE ADELPHI THERE WAS TO BE LET FURNISHED WITH A VIEW OF THE RIVER A SINGULARLY DESIRABLE AND COMPACT SET OF CHAMBERS FORMING A GENTEEL RESIDENCE FOR A YOUNG GENTLEMAN A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE INNS OF COURT OR OTHERWISE WITH IMMEDIATE POSSESSION TERMS

THE BONNET SHE HAD A MINUTE BEFORE LAID ASIDE WELL GO AND LOOK AT EM AWAY WE WENT THE ADVERTISEMENT DIRECTED US TO APPLY TO MRS CRUPP ON THE PREMISES AND WE RUNG THE AREA BELL WHICH WE SUPPOSED TO COMMUNICATE WITH MRS CRUPP IT WAS NOT UNTIL WE HAD RUNG THREE OR FOUR TIMES THAT WE COULD PREVAIL ON MRS CRUPP TO COMMUNICATE WITH US BUT AT LAST SHE APPEARED BEING A STOUT LADY WITH A FLOUNCE OF FLANNEL PETTICOAT BELOW A NANKEEN GOWN LET US SEE THESE CHAMBERS OF YOURS IF YOU PLEASE MAAM SAID MY AUNT FOR THIS GENTLEMAN SAID MRS CRUPP FEELING IN HER POCKET FOR HER KEYS YES FOR MY NEPHEW SAID MY AUNT AND A SWEET SET THEY IS FOR SICH SAID MRS CRUPP SO WE WENT UPSTAIRS THEY WERE ON THE TOP OF THE HOUSEA GREAT POINT WITH MY AUNT BEING NEAR THE FIREESCAPEAND CONSISTED OF A LITTLE HALFBLIND ENTRY WHERE YOU COULD SEE HARDLY ANYTHING A LITTLE STONEBLIND PANTRY WHERE YOU COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL A SITTINGROOM AND A BEDROOM THE FURNITURE WAS RATHER FADED BUT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME AND SURE ENOUGH THE RIVER WAS OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS AS I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE PLACE MY AUNT AND MRS CRUPP WITHDREW INTO THE PANTRY TO DISCUSS THE TERMS WHILE I REMAINED ON THE SITTINGROOM SOFA HARDLY DARING TO THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT I COULD BE DESTINED TO LIVE IN SUCH A NOBLE RESIDENCE AFTER A SINGLE COMBAT OF SOME DURATION THEY RETURNED AND I SAW TO MY JOY BOTH IN MRS CRUPPS COUNTENANCE AND IN MY AUNTS THAT THE DEED WAS DONE IS IT THE LAST OCCUPANTS FURNITURE INQUIRED MY AUNT YES IT IS MAAM SAID MRS CRUPP WHATS BECOME OF HIM ASKED MY AUNT MRS CRUPP WAS TAKEN WITH A TROUBLESOME COUGH IN THE MIDST OF

PROVIDED AND MRS CRUPP EXPRESSLY INTIMATED THAT SHE SHOULD ALWAYS YEARN TOWARDS ME AS A SON I WAS TO TAKE POSSESSION THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND MRS CRUPP SAID THANK HEAVEN SHE HAD NOW FOUND SUMMUN SHE COULD CARE FOR ON OUR WAY BACK MY AUNT INFORMED ME HOW SHE CONFIDENTLY TRUSTED THAT THE LIFE I WAS NOW TO LEAD WOULD MAKE ME FIRM AND SELFRELIANT WHICH WAS ALL I WANTED SHE REPEATED THIS SEVERAL TIMES NEXT DAY IN THE INTERVALS OF OUR ARRANGING FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF MY CLOTHES AND BOOKS FROM MR WICKFIELDS RELATIVE TO WHICH AND TO ALL MY LATE HOLIDAY I WROTE A LONG LETTER TO AGNES OF WHICH MY AUNT TOOK CHARGE AS SHE WAS TO LEAVE ON THE SUCCEEDING DAY NOT TO LENGTHEN THESE PARTICULARS I NEED ONLY ADD THAT SHE MADE A HANDSOME PROVISION FOR ALL MY POSSIBLE WANTS DURING MY MONTH OF TRIAL THAT STEERFORTH TO MY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AND HERS TOO DID NOT MAKE HIS APPEARANCE BEFORE SHE WENT AWAY THAT I SAW HER SAFELY SEATED IN THE DOVER COACH EXULTING IN THE COMING DISCOMFITURE OF THE VAGRANT DONKEYS WITH JANET AT HER SIDE AND THAT WHEN THE COACH WAS GONE I TURNED MY FACE TO THE ADELPHI PONDERING ON THE OLD DAYS WHEN I USED TO ROAM ABOUT ITS SUBTERRANEAN ARCHES AND ON THE HAPPY CHANGES WHICH HAD BROUGHT ME TO THE SURFACE CHAPTER MY FIRST DISSIPATION IT WAS A WONDERFULLY FINE THING TO HAVE THAT LOFTY CASTLE TO MYSELF AND TO FEEL WHEN I SHUT MY OUTER DOOR LIKE ROBINSON CRUSOE WHEN HE HAD GOT INTO HIS FORTIFICATION AND PULLED HIS LADDER UP AFTER HIM IT WAS A WONDERFULLY FINE THING TO WALK ABOUT TOWN WITH THE KEY OF MY HOUSE IN MY POCKET AND TO KNOW THAT I COULD ASK ANY FELLOW TO COME HOME AND MAKE QUITE SURE OF ITS BEING INCONVENIENT TO NOBODY IF IT WERE NOT SO TO ME IT WAS A WONDERFULLY FINE THING TO LET MYSELF IN AND OUT AND TO COME AND GO WITHOUT A WORD TO ANYONE AND TO RING MRS CRUPP UP GASPING FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH WHEN I WANTED HERAND WHEN SHE WAS DISPOSED TO COME ALL THIS I SAY WAS WONDERFULLY FINE BUT I MUST SAY TOO THAT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT WAS VERY DREARY IT WAS FINE IN THE MORNING PARTICULARLY IN THE FINE MORNINGS IT LOOKED A VERY FRESH FREE LIFE BY DAYLIGHT STILL FRESHER AND MORE FREE BY SUNLIGHT BUT AS THE DAY DECLINED THE LIFE SEEMED TO GO DOWN TOO I DONT KNOW HOW IT WAS IT SELDOM LOOKED WELL BY CANDLELIGHT I WANTED SOMEBODY TO TALK TO THEN I MISSED AGNES I FOUND A TREMENDOUS BLANK IN THE PLACE OF THAT SMILING REPOSITORY OF MY CONFIDENCE MRS CRUPP APPEARED TO BE A LONG WAY OFF I THOUGHT ABOUT MY PREDECESSOR WHO HAD DIED OF DRINK AND SMOKE AND I COULD HAVE WISHED HE HAD BEEN SO GOOD AS TO LIVE AND NOT BOTHER ME WITH HIS DECEASE AFTER TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS I FELT AS IF I HAD LIVED THERE FOR A YEAR AND YET I WAS NOT AN HOUR OLDER BUT WAS QUITE AS MUCH TORMENTED BY MY OWN YOUTHFULNESS AS EVER STEERFORTH NOT YET APPEARING WHICH INDUCED ME TO APPREHEND THAT HE MUST BE ILL I LEFT THE COMMONS EARLY ON THE THIRD DAY AND WALKED OUT TO HIGHGATE MRS STEERFORTH WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE ME AND SAID THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITH ONE OF HIS OXFORD FRIENDS TO SEE ANOTHER WHO LIVED NEAR ST ALBANS BUT THAT SHE EXPECTED HIM TO RETURN TOMORROW I WAS SO FOND OF HIM THAT I FELT QUITE JEALOUS OF HIS OXFORD FRIENDS AS SHE PRESSED ME TO STAY TO DINNER I REMAINED AND I BELIEVE WE TALKED ABOUT NOTHING BUT HIM ALL DAY I TOLD HER HOW MUCH THE PEOPLE LIKED HIM AT YARMOUTH AND WHAT A DELIGHTFUL COMPANION HE HAD BEEN MISS DARTLE WAS FULL OF HINTS AND MYSTERIOUS QUESTIONS BUT TOOK A GREAT INTEREST IN ALL OUR PROCEEDINGS THERE AND SAID WAS IT REALLY THOUGH AND SO FORTH SO OFTEN THAT SHE GOT EVERYTHING OUT OF ME SHE WANTED TO KNOW HER APPEARANCE WAS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE DESCRIBED IT WHEN I FIRST SAW HER BUT THE SOCIETY OF THE TWO LADIES WAS SO AGREEABLE AND CAME SO NATURAL TO ME THAT I FELT MYSELF FALLING A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HER I COULD NOT HELP THINKING SEVERAL TIMES IN THE COURSE OF THE EVENING AND PARTICULARLY WHEN I WALKED HOME AT NIGHT WHAT DELIGHTFUL COMPANY SHE WOULD BE IN BUCKINGHAM STREET I WAS TAKING MY COFFEE AND ROLL IN THE MORNING BEFORE GOING TO THE COMMONSAND I MAY OBSERVE IN THIS PLACE THAT IT IS SURPRISING HOW MUCH COFFEE MRS CRUPP USED AND HOW WEAK IT WAS CONSIDERINGWHEN STEERFORTH HIMSELF WALKED IN TO MY UNBOUNDED JOY MY DEAR STEERFORTH CRIED I I BEGAN TO THINK I SHOULD NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN I WAS CARRIED OFF BY FORCE OF ARMS SAID STEERFORTH THE VERY NEXT MORNING AFTER I GOT HOME WHY DAISY WHAT A RARE OLD BACHELOR YOU ARE HERE I SHOWED HIM OVER THE ESTABLISHMENT NOT OMITTING THE PANTRY WITH NO LITTLE PRIDE AND HE COMMENDED IT HIGHLY I TELL YOU WHAT OLD BOY HE ADDED I SHALL MAKE QUITE A TOWNHOUSE OF THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU GIVE ME NOTICE TO QUIT THIS WAS A DELIGHTFUL HEARING I TOLD HIM IF HE WAITED FOR THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TILL DOOMSDAY BUT YOU SHALL HAVE SOME BREAKFAST SAID I WITH MY HAND ON THE BELLROPE AND MRS CRUPP SHALL MAKE YOU SOME FRESH COFFEE AND ILL TOAST YOU SOME BACON IN A BACHELORS DUTCHOVEN THAT I HAVE GOT HERE NO NO SAID STEERFORTH DONT RING I CANT I AM GOING TO BREAKFAST WITH ONE OF THESE FELLOWS WHO IS AT THE PIAZZA HOTEL IN COVENT GARDEN BUT YOULL COME BACK TO DINNER SAID I I CANT UPON MY LIFE THERES NOTHING I SHOULD LIKE BETTER BUT I MUST REMAIN WITH THESE TWO FELLOWS WE ARE ALL THREE OFF TOGETHER TOMORROW MORNING THEN BRING THEM HERE TO DINNER I RETURNED DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD COME OH THEY WOULD COME FAST ENOUGH SAID STEERFORTH BUT WE SHOULD INCONVENIENCE YOU YOU HAD BETTER COME AND DINE WITH US SOMEWHERE I WOULD NOT BY ANY MEANS CONSENT TO THIS FOR IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I REALLY OUGHT TO HAVE A LITTLE HOUSEWARMING AND THAT THERE NEVER COULD BE A BETTER OPPORTUNITY I HAD A NEW PRIDE IN MY ROOMS AFTER HIS APPROVAL OF THEM AND BURNED WITH A DESIRE TO DEVELOP THEIR UTMOST RESOURCES I THEREFORE MADE HIM PROMISE POSITIVELY IN THE NAMES OF HIS TWO FRIENDS AND WE APPOINTED SIX OCLOCK AS THE DINNERHOUR WHEN HE WAS GONE I RANG FOR MRS CRUPP AND ACQUAINTED HER WITH MY DESPERATE DESIGN MRS CRUPP SAID IN THE FIRST PLACE OF COURSE IT WAS WELL KNOWN SHE COULDNT BE EXPECTED TO WAIT BUT SHE KNEW A HANDY YOUNG MAN WHO SHE THOUGHT COULD BE PREVAILED UPON TO DO IT AND WHOSE TERMS WOULD BE FIVE SHILLINGS AND WHAT I PLEASED I SAID CERTAINLY WE WOULD HAVE HIM NEXT MRS CRUPP SAID IT WAS CLEAR SHE COULDNT BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE WHICH I FELT TO BE REASONABLE AND THAT A YOUNG GAL STATIONED IN THE PANTRY WITH A BEDROOM CANDLE THERE NEVER TO DESIST FROM WASHING PLATES WOULD BE INDISPENSABLE I SAID WHAT WOULD BE THE EXPENSE OF THIS YOUNG FEMALE AND MRS CRUPP SAID SHE SUPPOSED EIGHTEENPENCE WOULD NEITHER MAKE ME NOR BREAK ME I SAID I SUPPOSED NOT AND THAT WAS SETTLED THEN MRS CRUPP SAID NOW ABOUT THE DINNER IT WAS A REMARKABLE INSTANCE OF WANT OF FORETHOUGHT ON THE PART OF THE IRONMONGER WHO HAD MADE MRS CRUPPS KITCHEN FIREPLACE THAT IT WAS CAPABLE OF COOKING NOTHING BUT CHOPS AND MASHED POTATOES AS TO A FISHKITTLE MRS CRUPP SAID WELL WOULD I ONLY COME AND LOOK AT THE RANGE SHE COULDNT SAY FAIRER THAN THAT WOULD I COME AND LOOK AT IT AS I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH THE WISER IF I HAD LOOKED AT IT I DECLINED AND SAID NEVER MIND FISH BUT MRS CRUPP SAID DONT SAY THAT OYSTERS WAS IN WHY NOT THEM SO THAT WAS SETTLED MRS CRUPP THEN SAID WHAT SHE WOULD RECOMMEND WOULD BE THIS A PAIR OF HOT ROAST FOWLSFROM THE PASTRYCOOKS A DISH OF STEWED BEEF WITH VEGETABLESFROM THE PASTRYCOOKS TWO LITTLE CORNER THINGS AS A RAISED PIE AND A DISH OF KIDNEYSFROM THE PASTRYCOOKS A TART AND IF I LIKED A SHAPE OF JELLYFROM THE PASTRYCOOKS THIS MRS CRUPP SAID WOULD LEAVE HER AT FULL LIBERTY TO CONCENTRATE HER MIND ON THE POTATOES AND TO SERVE UP THE CHEESE AND CELERY AS SHE COULD WISH TO SEE IT DONE I ACTED ON MRS CRUPPS OPINION AND GAVE THE ORDER AT THE PASTRYCOOKS MYSELF WALKING ALONG THE STRAND AFTERWARDS AND OBSERVING A HARD MOTTLED SUBSTANCE IN THE WINDOW OF A HAM AND BEEF SHOP WHICH RESEMBLED MARBLE BUT WAS LABELLED MOCK TURTLE I WENT IN AND BOUGHT A SLAB OF IT WHICH I HAVE SINCE SEEN REASON TO BELIEVE WOULD HAVE SUFFICED FOR FIFTEEN PEOPLE THIS PREPARATION MRS CRUPP AFTER SOME DIFFICULTY CONSENTED TO WARM UP AND IT SHRUNK SO MUCH IN A LIQUID STATE THAT WE FOUND IT WHAT STEERFORTH CALLED RATHER A TIGHT FIT FOR FOUR THESE PREPARATIONS HAPPILY COMPLETED I BOUGHT A LITTLE DESSERT IN COVENT GARDEN MARKET AND GAVE A RATHER EXTENSIVE ORDER AT A RETAIL WINEMERCHANTS IN THAT VICINITY WHEN I CAME HOME IN THE AFTERNOON AND SAW THE BOTTLES DRAWN UP IN A SQUARE ON THE PANTRY FLOOR THEY LOOKED SO NUMEROUS THOUGH THERE WERE TWO MISSING WHICH MADE MRS CRUPP VERY UNCOMFORTABLE THAT I WAS ABSOLUTELY FRIGHTENED AT THEM ONE OF STEERFORTHS FRIENDS WAS NAMED GRAINGER AND THE OTHER MARKHAM THEY WERE BOTH VERY GAY AND LIVELY FELLOWS GRAINGER SOMETHING OLDER THAN STEERFORTH MARKHAM YOUTHFULLOOKING AND I SHOULD SAY NOT MORE THAN TWENTY I OBSERVED THAT THE LATTER ALWAYS SPOKE OF HIMSELF INDEFINITELY AS A MAN AND SELDOM OR NEVER IN THE FIRST PERSON SINGULAR A MAN MIGHT GET ON VERY WELL HERE MR COPPERFIELD SAID MARKHAMMEANING HIMSELF ITS NOT A BAD SITUATION SAID I AND THE ROOMS ARE REALLY COMMODIOUS I HOPE YOU HAVE BOTH BROUGHT APPETITES WITH YOU SAID STEERFORTH UPON MY HONOUR RETURNED MARKHAM TOWN SEEMS TO SHARPEN A MANS APPETITE A MAN IS HUNGRY ALL DAY LONG A MAN IS PERPETUALLY EATING BEING A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AT FIRST AND FEELING MUCH TOO YOUNG TO PRESIDE I MADE STEERFORTH TAKE THE HEAD OF THE TABLE WHEN DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED AND SEATED MYSELF OPPOSITE TO HIM EVERYTHING WAS VERY GOOD WE DID NOT SPARE THE WINE AND HE EXERTED HIMSELF SO BRILLIANTLY TO MAKE THE THING PASS OFF WELL THAT THERE WAS NO PAUSE IN OUR FESTIVITY I WAS NOT QUITE SUCH GOOD COMPANY DURING DINNER AS I COULD HAVE WISHED TO BE FOR MY CHAIR WAS OPPOSITE THE DOOR AND MY ATTENTION WAS DISTRACTED BY OBSERVING THAT THE HANDY YOUNG MAN WENT OUT OF THE ROOM VERY OFTEN AND THAT HIS SHADOW ALWAYS PRESENTED ITSELF IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS ON THE WALL OF THE ENTRY WITH A BOTTLE AT ITS MOUTH THE YOUNG GAL LIKEWISE OCCASIONED ME SOME UNEASINESS NOT SO MUCH BY NEGLECTING TO WASH THE PLATES AS BY BREAKING THEM FOR BEING OF AN INQUISITIVE DISPOSITION AND UNABLE TO CONFINE HERSELF AS HER POSITIVE INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO THE PANTRY SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PEERING IN AT US AND CONSTANTLY IMAGINING HERSELF DETECTED IN WHICH BELIEF SHE SEVERAL TIMES RETIRED UPON THE PLATES WITH WHICH SHE HAD CAREFULLY PAVED THE FLOOR AND DID A GREAT DEAL OF DESTRUCTION THESE HOWEVER WERE SMALL DRAWBACKS AND EASILY FORGOTTEN WHEN THE CLOTH WAS CLEARED AND THE DESSERT PUT ON THE TABLE AT WHICH PERIOD OF THE ENTERTAINMENT THE HANDY YOUNG MAN WAS DISCOVERED TO BE SPEECHLESS GIVING HIM PRIVATE DIRECTIONS TO SEEK THE SOCIETY OF MRS CRUPP AND TO REMOVE THE YOUNG GAL TO THE BASEMENT ALSO I ABANDONED MYSELF TO ENJOYMENT I BEGAN BY BEING SINGULARLY CHEERFUL AND LIGHTHEARTED ALL SORTS OF HALFFORGOTTEN THINGS TO TALK ABOUT CAME RUSHING INTO MY MIND AND MADE ME HOLD FORTH IN A MOST UNWONTED MANNER I LAUGHED HEARTILY AT MY OWN JOKES AND EVERYBODY ELSES CALLED STEERFORTH TO ORDER FOR NOT PASSING THE WINE MADE SEVERAL ENGAGEMENTS TO GO TO OXFORD ANNOUNCED THAT I MEANT TO HAVE A DINNERPARTY EXACTLY LIKE THAT ONCE A WEEK UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE AND MADLY TOOK SO MUCH SNUFF OUT OF GRAINGERS BOX THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO GO INTO THE PANTRY AND HAVE A PRIVATE FIT OF SNEEZING TEN MINUTES LONG I WENT ON BY PASSING THE WINE FASTER AND FASTER YET AND CONTINUALLY STARTING UP WITH A CORKSCREW TO OPEN MORE WINE LONG BEFORE ANY WAS NEEDED I PROPOSED STEERFORTHS HEALTH I SAID HE WAS MY DEAREST FRIEND THE PROTECTOR OF MY BOYHOOD AND THE COMPANION OF MY PRIME I SAID I WAS DELIGHTED TO PROPOSE HIS HEALTH I SAID I OWED HIM MORE OBLIGATIONS THAN I COULD EVER REPAY AND HELD HIM IN A HIGHER ADMIRATION THAN I COULD EVER EXPRESS I FINISHED BY SAYING ILL GIVE YOU STEERFORTH GOD BLESS HIM HURRAH WE GAVE HIM THREE TIMES THREE AND ANOTHER AND A GOOD ONE TO FINISH WITH I BROKE MY GLASS IN GOING ROUND THE TABLE TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM AND I SAID IN TWO WORDS STEERFORTHYOURETHEGUIDINGSTAROFMYEXISTENCE I WENT ON BY FINDING SUDDENLY THAT SOMEBODY WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG MARKHAM WAS THE SINGER AND HE SANG WHEN THE HEART OF A MAN IS DEPRESSED WITH CARE HE SAID WHEN HE HAD SUNG IT HE WOULD GIVE US WOMAN I TOOK OBJECTION TO THAT AND I COULDNT ALLOW IT I SAID IT WAS NOT A RESPECTFUL WAY OF PROPOSING THE TOAST AND I WOULD NEVER PERMIT THAT TOAST TO BE DRUNK IN MY HOUSE OTHERWISE THAN AS THE LADIES I WAS VERY HIGH WITH HIM MAINLY I THINK BECAUSE I SAW STEERFORTH AND GRAINGER LAUGHING AT MEOR AT HIMOR AT BOTH OF US HE SAID A MAN WAS NOT TO BE DICTATED TO I SAID A MAN WAS HE SAID A MAN WAS NOT TO BE INSULTED THEN I SAID HE WAS RIGHT THERENEVER UNDER MY ROOF WHERE THE LARES WERE SACRED AND THE LAWS OF HOSPITALITY PARAMOUNT HE SAID IT WAS NO DEROGATION FROM A MANS DIGNITY TO CONFESS THAT I WAS A DEVILISH GOOD FELLOW I INSTANTLY PROPOSED HIS HEALTH SOMEBODY WAS SMOKING WE WERE ALL SMOKING I WAS SMOKING AND TRYING TO SUPPRESS A RISING TENDENCY TO SHUDDER STEERFORTH HAD MADE A SPEECH ABOUT ME IN THE COURSE OF WHICH I HAD BEEN AFFECTED ALMOST TO TEARS I RETURNED THANKS AND HOPED THE PRESENT COMPANY WOULD DINE WITH ME TOMORROW AND THE DAY AFTEREACH DAY AT FIVE OCLOCK THAT WE MIGHT ENJOY THE PLEASURES OF CONVERSATION AND SOCIETY THROUGH A LONG EVENING I FELT CALLED UPON TO PROPOSE AN INDIVIDUAL I WOULD GIVE THEM MY AUNT MISS BETSEY TROTWOOD THE BEST OF HER SEX SOMEBODY WAS LEANING OUT OF MY BEDROOM WINDOW REFRESHING HIS FOREHEAD AGAINST THE COOL STONE OF THE PARAPET AND FEELING THE AIR UPON HIS FACE IT WAS MYSELF I WAS

WINDOWCURTAINS WHEN STEERFORTH LAUGHING TOOK ME BY THE ARM AND LED ME OUT WE WENT DOWNSTAIRS ONE BEHIND ANOTHER NEAR THE BOTTOM SOMEBODY FELL AND ROLLED DOWN SOMEBODY ELSE SAID IT WAS COPPERFIELD I WAS ANGRY AT THAT FALSE REPORT UNTIL FINDING MYSELF ON MY BACK IN THE PASSAGE I BEGAN TO THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME FOUNDATION FOR IT A VERY FOGGY NIGHT WITH GREAT RINGS ROUND THE LAMPS IN THE STREETS THERE WAS AN INDISTINCT TALK OF ITS BEING WET I CONSIDERED IT FROSTY STEERFORTH DUSTED ME UNDER A LAMPPOST AND PUT MY HAT INTO SHAPE WHICH SOMEBODY PRODUCED FROM SOMEWHERE IN A MOST EXTRAORDINARY MANNER FOR I HADNT HAD IT ON BEFORE STEERFORTH THEN SAID YOU ARE ALL RIGHT COPPERFIELD ARE YOU NOT AND I TOLD HIM NEVERBERRER A MAN SITTING IN A PIGEONHOLEPLACE LOOKED OUT OF THE FOG AND TOOK MONEY FROM SOMEBODY INQUIRING IF I WAS ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN PAID FOR AND APPEARING RATHER DOUBTFUL AS I REMEMBER IN THE GLIMPSE I HAD OF HIM WHETHER TO TAKE THE MONEY FOR ME OR NOT SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WE WERE VERY HIGH UP IN A VERY HOT THEATRE LOOKING DOWN INTO A LARGE PIT THAT SEEMED TO ME TO SMOKE THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM IT WAS CRAMMED WERE SO INDISTINCT THERE WAS A GREAT STAGE TOO LOOKING VERY CLEAN AND SMOOTH AFTER THE STREETS AND THERE WERE PEOPLE UPON IT TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING OR OTHER BUT NOT AT ALL INTELLIGIBLY THERE WAS AN ABUNDANCE OF BRIGHT LIGHTS AND THERE WAS MUSIC AND THERE WERE LADIES DOWN IN THE BOXES AND I DONT KNOW WHAT MORE THE WHOLE BUILDING LOOKED TO ME AS IF IT WERE LEARNING TO SWIM IT CONDUCTED ITSELF IN SUCH AN UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER WHEN I TRIED TO STEADY IT ON SOMEBODYS MOTION WE RESOLVED TO GO DOWNSTAIRS TO THE DRESSBOXES WHERE THE LADIES WERE A GENTLEMAN LOUNGING FULL DRESSED ON A SOFA WITH AN OPERAGLASS IN HIS HAND PASSED BEFORE MY VIEW AND ALSO MY OWN FIGURE AT FULL LENGTH IN A GLASS THEN I WAS BEING USHERED INTO ONE OF THESE BOXES AND FOUND MYSELF SAYING SOMETHING AS I SAT DOWN AND PEOPLE ABOUT ME CRYING SILENCE TO SOMEBODY AND LADIES CASTING INDIGNANT GLANCES AT ME ANDWHAT YESAGNES SITTING ON THE SEAT BEFORE ME IN THE SAME BOX WITH A LADY AND GENTLEMAN BESIDE HER WHOM I DIDNT KNOW I SEE HER FACE NOW BETTER THAN I DID THEN I DARE SAY WITH ITS INDELIBLE LOOK OF REGRET AND WONDER TURNED UPON ME AGNES I SAID THICKLY LORBLESSMER AGNES HUSH PRAY SHE ANSWERED I COULD NOT CONCEIVE WHY YOU DISTURB THE COMPANY LOOK AT THE STAGE I TRIED ON HER INJUNCTION TO FIX IT AND TO HEAR SOMETHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE BUT QUITE IN VAIN I LOOKED AT HER AGAIN BY AND BY AND SAW HER SHRINK INTO HER CORNER AND PUT HER GLOVED HAND TO HER FOREHEAD AGNES I SAID IMAFRAIDYOURENORWELL YES YES DO NOT MIND ME TROTWOOD SHE RETURNED LISTEN ARE YOU GOING AWAY SOON AMIGOARAWAYSOO I REPEATED YES I HAD A STUPID INTENTION OF REPLYING THAT I WAS GOING TO WAIT TO HAND HER DOWNSTAIRS I SUPPOSE I EXPRESSED IT SOMEHOW FOR AFTER SHE HAD LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY FOR A LITTLE WHILE SHE APPEARED TO UNDERSTAND AND REPLIED IN A LOW TONE I KNOW YOU WILL DO AS I ASK YOU IF I TELL YOU I AM VERY EARNEST IN IT GO AWAY NOW TROTWOOD FOR MY SAKE AND ASK YOUR FRIENDS TO TAKE YOU HOME SHE HAD SO FAR IMPROVED ME FOR THE TIME THAT THOUGH I WAS ANGRY WITH HER I FELT ASHAMED AND WITH A SHORT GOORI WHICH I INTENDED FOR GOOD NIGHT GOT UP AND WENT AWAY THEY FOLLOWED AND I STEPPED AT ONCE OUT OF THE BOXDOOR INTO MY BEDROOM WHERE ONLY STEERFORTH WAS WITH ME HELPING ME TO UNDRESS AND WHERE I WAS BY TURNS TELLING HIM THAT AGNES WAS MY SISTER AND ADJURING HIM TO BRING THE CORKSCREW THAT I MIGHT OPEN ANOTHER BOTTLE OF WINE HOW SOMEBODY LYING IN MY BED LAY SAYING AND DOING ALL THIS OVER AGAIN AT CROSS PURPOSES IN A FEVERISH DREAM ALL NIGHTTHE BED A ROCKING SEA THAT WAS NEVER STILL HOW AS THAT SOMEBODY SLOWLY SETTLED DOWN INTO MYSELF DID I BEGIN TO PARCH AND FEEL AS IF MY OUTER COVERING OF SKIN WERE A HARD BOARD MY TONGUE THE BOTTOM OF AN EMPTY KETTLE FURRED WITH LONG SERVICE AND BURNING UP OVER A SLOW FIRE THE PALMS OF MY HANDS HOT PLATES OF METAL WHICH NO ICE COULD COOL BUT THE AGONY OF MIND THE REMORSE AND SHAME I FELT WHEN I BECAME CONSCIOUS NEXT DAY MY HORROR OF HAVING COMMITTED A THOUSAND OFFENCES I HAD FORGOTTEN AND WHICH NOTHING COULD EVER EXPIATEMY RECOLLECTION OF THAT INDELIBLE LOOK WHICH AGNES HAD GIVEN METHE TORTURING IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMMUNICATING WITH HER NOT KNOWING BEAST THAT I WAS HOW SHE CAME TO BE IN LONDON OR WHERE SHE STAYEDMY DISGUST OF THE VERY SIGHT OF THE ROOM WHERE THE REVEL HAD BEEN HELDMY RACKING HEADTHE SMELL OF SMOKE THE SIGHT OF GLASSES THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF GOING OUT OR EVEN GETTING UP OH WHAT A DAY IT WAS OH WHAT AN EVENING WHEN I SAT DOWN BY MY FIRE TO A BASIN OF MUTTON BROTH DIMPLED ALL OVER WITH FAT AND THOUGHT I WAS GOING THE WAY OF MY PREDECESSOR AND SHOULD SUCCEED TO HIS DISMAL STORY AS WELL AS TO HIS CHAMBERS AND HAD HALF A MIND TO RUSH EXPRESS TO DOVER AND REVEAL ALL WHAT AN EVENING WHEN MRS CRUPP COMING IN TO TAKE AWAY THE BROTHBASIN PRODUCED ONE KIDNEY ON A CHEESEPLATE AS THE ENTIRE REMAINS OF YESTERDAYS FEAST AND I WAS REALLY INCLINED TO FALL UPON HER NANKEEN BREAST AND SAY IN HEARTFELT PENITENCE OH MRS CRUPP MRS CRUPP NEVER MIND THE BROKEN MEATS I AM VERY MISERABLEONLY THAT I DOUBTED EVEN AT THAT PASS IF MRS CRUPP WERE QUITE THE SORT OF WOMAN TO CONFIDE IN CHAPTER GOOD AND BAD ANGELS I WAS GOING OUT AT MY DOOR ON THE MORNING AFTER THAT DEPLORABLE DAY OF HEADACHE SICKNESS AND REPENTANCE WITH AN ODD CONFUSION IN MY MIND RELATIVE TO THE DATE OF MY DINNERPARTY AS IF A BODY OF TITANS HAD TAKEN AN ENORMOUS LEVER AND PUSHED THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY SOME MONTHS BACK WHEN I SAW A TICKETPORTER COMING UPSTAIRS WITH A LETTER IN HIS HAND HE WAS TAKING HIS TIME ABOUT HIS ERRAND THEN BUT WHEN HE SAW ME ON THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE LOOKING AT HIM OVER THE BANISTERS HE SWUNG INTO A TROT AND CAME UP PANTING AS IF HE HAD RUN HIMSELF INTO A STATE OF EXHAUSTION T COPPERFIELD ESQUIRE SAID THE TICKETPORTER TOUCHING HIS HAT WITH HIS LITTLE CANE I COULD SCARCELY LAY CLAIM TO THE NAME I WAS SO DISTURBED BY THE CONVICTION THAT THE LETTER CAME FROM AGNES HOWEVER I TOLD HIM I WAS T COPPERFIELD ESQUIRE AND HE BELIEVED IT AND GAVE ME THE LETTER WHICH HE SAID REQUIRED AN ANSWER I SHUT HIM OUT ON THE LANDING TO WAIT FOR THE ANSWER AND WENT INTO MY CHAMBERS AGAIN IN SUCH A NERVOUS STATE THAT I WAS FAIN TO LAY THE LETTER DOWN ON MY BREAKFAST TABLE AND FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH THE OUTSIDE OF IT A LITTLE BEFORE I COULD RESOLVE TO BREAK THE SEAL I FOUND WHEN I DID OPEN IT THAT IT WAS A VERY KIND NOTE CONTAINING NO REFERENCE TO MY CONDITION AT THE THEATRE ALL IT SAID WAS MY DEAR TROTWOOD I AM STAYING AT THE HOUSE OF PAPAS AGENT MR WATERBROOK IN ELY PLACE HOLBORN WILL YOU COME AND SEE ME TODAY AT ANY TIME YOU LIKE TO APPOINT EVER YOURS AFFECTIONATELY AGNES IT TOOK ME SUCH A LONG TIME TO WRITE AN ANSWER AT ALL TO MY SATISFACTION THAT I DONT KNOW WHAT THE TICKETPORTER CAN HAVE THOUGHT UNLESS HE THOUGHT I WAS LEARNING TO WRITE I MUST HAVE WRITTEN HALFADOZEN ANSWERS AT LEAST I BEGAN ONE HOW CAN I EVER HOPE MY DEAR AGNES TO EFFACE FROM YOUR REMEMBRANCE THE DISGUSTING IMPRESSIONTHERE I DIDNT LIKE IT AND THEN I TORE IT UP I BEGAN ANOTHER SHAKESPEARE HAS OBSERVED MY DEAR AGNES HOW

ASSOCIATED ITSELF WITH THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER AND BECAME AN ABSURDITY AFTER MANY ATTEMPTS I WROTE MY DEAR AGNES YOUR LETTER IS LIKE YOU AND WHAT COULD I SAY OF IT THAT WOULD BE HIGHER PRAISE THAN THAT I WILL COME AT FOUR OCLOCK AFFECTIONATELY AND SORROWFULLY TC WITH THIS MISSIVE WHICH I WAS IN TWENTY MINDS AT ONCE ABOUT RECALLING AS SOON AS IT WAS OUT OF MY HANDS THE TICKETPORTER AT LAST DEPARTED IF THE DAY WERE HALF AS TREMENDOUS TO ANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL GENTLEMAN IN DOCTORS COMMONS AS IT WAS TO ME I SINCERELY BELIEVE HE MADE SOME EXPIATION FOR HIS SHARE IN THAT ROTTEN OLD ECCLESIASTICAL CHEESE ALTHOUGH I LEFT THE OFFICE AT HALF PAST THREE AND WAS PROWLING ABOUT THE PLACE OF APPOINTMENT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS THE APPOINTED TIME WAS EXCEEDED BY A FULL QUARTER OF AN HOUR ACCORDING TO THE CLOCK OF ST ANDREWS HOLBORN BEFORE I COULD MUSTER UP SUFFICIENT DESPERATION TO PULL THE PRIVATE BELLHANDLE LET INTO THE LEFTHAND DOORPOST OF MR WATERBROOKS HOUSE THE PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS OF MR WATERBROOKS ESTABLISHMENT WAS DONE ON THE GROUNDFLOOR AND THE GENTEEL BUSINESS OF WHICH THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL IN THE UPPER PART OF THE BUILDING I WAS SHOWN INTO A PRETTY BUT RATHER CLOSE DRAWINGROOM AND THERE SAT AGNES NETTING A PURSE SHE LOOKED SO QUIET AND GOOD AND REMINDED ME SO STRONGLY OF MY AIRY FRESH SCHOOL DAYS AT CANTERBURY AND THE SODDEN SMOKY STUPID WRETCH I HAD BEEN

THEY ARE PUT TOGETHER I JUDGE HIM PARTLY FROM YOUR ACCOUNT OF HIM TROTWOOD AND YOUR CHARACTER AND THE INFLUENCE HE HAS OVER YOU THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING IN HER MODEST VOICE THAT SEEMED TO TOUCH A CHORD WITHIN ME ANSWERING TO THAT SOUND ALONE IT WAS ALWAYS EARNEST BUT WHEN IT WAS VERY EARNEST AS IT WAS NOW THERE WAS A THRILL IN IT THAT QUITE SUBDUED ME I SAT LOOKING AT HER AS SHE CAST HER EYES DOWN ON HER WORK I SAT SEEMING STILL TO LISTEN TO HER AND STEERFORTH IN SPITE OF ALL MY ATTACHMENT TO HIM DARKENED IN THAT TONE IT IS VERY BOLD IN ME SAID AGNES LOOKING UP AGAIN WHO HAVE LIVED IN SUCH SECLUSION AND CAN KNOW SO LITTLE OF THE WORLD TO GIVE YOU MY ADVICE SO CONFIDENTLY OR EVEN TO HAVE THIS STRONG OPINION BUT I KNOW IN WHAT IT IS ENGENDERED TROTWOODIN HOW TRUE A REMEMBRANCE OF OUR HAVING GROWN UP TOGETHER AND IN HOW TRUE AN INTEREST IN ALL RELATING TO YOU IT IS THAT WHICH MAKES ME BOLD I AM CERTAIN THAT WHAT I SAY IS RIGHT I AM QUITE SURE IT IS I FEEL AS IF IT WERE SOMEONE ELSE SPEAKING TO YOU AND NOT I WHEN I CAUTION YOU THAT YOU HAVE MADE A DANGEROUS FRIEND AGAIN I LOOKED AT HER AGAIN I LISTENED TO HER AFTER SHE WAS SILENT AND AGAIN HIS IMAGE THOUGH IT WAS STILL FIXED IN MY HEART DARKENED I AM NOT SO UNREASONABLE AS TO EXPECT SAID AGNES RESUMING HER USUAL TONE AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THAT YOU WILL OR THAT YOU CAN AT ONCE CHANGE ANY SENTIMENT THAT HAS BECOME A CONVICTION TO YOU LEAST OF ALL A SENTIMENT THAT IS ROOTED IN YOUR TRUSTING DISPOSITION YOU OUGHT NOT HASTILY TO DO THAT I ONLY ASK YOU TROTWOOD IF YOU EVER THINK OF MEI MEAN WITH A QUIET SMILE FOR I WAS GOING TO INTERRUPT HER AND SHE KNEW WHY AS OFTEN AS YOU THINK OF METO THINK OF WHAT I HAVE SAID DO YOU FORGIVE ME FOR ALL THIS I WILL FORGIVE YOU AGNES I REPLIED WHEN YOU COME TO DO STEERFORTH JUSTICE AND TO LIKE HIM AS WELL AS I DO NOT UNTIL THEN SAID AGNES I SAW A PASSING SHADOW ON HER FACE WHEN I MADE THIS MENTION OF HIM BUT SHE RETURNED MY SMILE AND WE WERE AGAIN AS UNRESERVED IN OUR MUTUAL CONFIDENCE AS OF OLD AND WHEN AGNES SAID I WILL YOU FORGIVE ME THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN I RECALL IT SAID AGNES SHE WOULD HAVE DISMISSED THE SUBJECT SO BUT I WAS TOO FULL OF IT TO ALLOW THAT AND INSISTED ON TELLING HER HOW IT HAPPENED THAT I HAD DISGRACED MYSELF AND WHAT CHAIN OF ACCIDENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES HAD HAD THE THEATRE FOR ITS FINAL LINK IT WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO ME TO DO THIS AND TO ENLARGE ON THE OBLIGATION THAT I OWED TO STEERFORTH FOR HIS CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS UNABLE TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF YOU MUST NOT FORGET SAID AGNES CALMLY CHANGING THE CONVERSATION AS SOON AS I HAD CONCLUDED THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS TO TELL ME NOT ONLY WHEN YOU FALL INTO TROUBLE BUT WHEN YOU FALL IN LOVE WHO HAS SUCCEEDED TO MISS LARKINS TROTWOOD NO ONE AGNES SOMEONE TROTWOOD SAID AGNES LAUGHING AND HOLDING UP HER FINGER

TOLD ME THAT IF I WERE FAITHFUL TO HER IN MY CONFIDENCE SHE THOUGHT SHE SHOULD KEEP A LITTLE REGISTER OF MY VIOLENT ATTACHMENTS WITH THE DATE DURATION AND TERMINATION OF EACH LIKE THE TABLE OF THE REIGNS OF THE KINGS AND QUEENS IN THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND THEN SHE ASKED ME IF I HAD SEEN URIAH URIAH HEEP SAID I NO IS HE IN LONDON HE COMES TO THE OFFICE DOWNSTAIRS EVERY DAY RETURNED AGNES HE WAS IN

IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THATNOT MORE THAN TWO OR THREE DAYSWHEN HE GAVE ME THE FIRST INTIMATION OF WHAT I TELL YOU IT WAS SAD TO SEE HIM STRUGGLING BETWEEN HIS DESIRE TO REPRESENT IT TO ME AS A MATTER OF CHOICE ON HIS PART AND HIS INABILITY TO CONCEAL THAT IT WAS FORCED UPON HIM I FELT VERY SORRY FORCED UPON HIM AGNES WHO FORCES IT UPON HIM URIAH SHE REPLIED AFTER A MOMENTS HESITATION HAS MADE HIMSELF INDISPENSABLE TO PAPA HE IS SUBTLE AND WATCHFUL HE HAS MASTERED PAPAS WEAKNESSES FOSTERED THEM AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THEM UNTILTO SAY ALL THAT I MEAN IN A WORD TROTWOODUNTIL PAPA IS AFRAID OF HIM THERE WAS MORE THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SAID MORE THAT SHE KNEW OR THAT SHE SUSPECTED I CLEARLY SAW I COULD NOT GIVE HER PAIN BY ASKING WHAT IT WAS FOR I KNEW THAT SHE WITHHELD IT FROM ME TO SPARE HER FATHER IT HAD LONG BEEN GOING ON TO THIS I WAS SENSIBLE YES I COULD NOT BUT FEEL ON THE LEAST REFLECTION THAT IT HAD BEEN GOING ON TO THIS FOR A LONG TIME I REMAINED SILENT HIS ASCENDANCY OVER PAPA SAID AGNES IS VERY GREAT HE PROFESSES HUMILITY AND GRATITUDEWITH TRUTH PERHAPS I HOPE SOBUT HIS POSITION IS REALLY ONE OF POWER AND I FEAR HE MAKES A HARD USE OF HIS POWER I SAID HE WAS A HOUND WHICH AT THE MOMENT WAS A GREAT SATISFACTION TO ME AT THE TIME I SPEAK OF AS THE TIME WHEN PAPA SPOKE TO ME PURSUED AGNES HE HAD TOLD PAPA THAT HE WAS GOING AWAY THAT HE WAS VERY SORRY AND UNWILLING TO LEAVE BUT THAT HE HAD BETTER PROSPECTS PAPA WAS VERY MUCH DEPRESSED THEN AND MORE BOWED DOWN BY CARE THAN EVER YOU OR I HAVE SEEN HIM BUT HE SEEMED RELIEVED BY THIS EXPEDIENT OF THE PARTNERSHIP THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME HE SEEMED HURT BY IT AND ASHAMED OF IT AND HOW DID YOU RECEIVE IT AGNES I DID TROTWOOD SHE REPLIED WHAT I HOPE WAS RIGHT FEELING SURE THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR PAPAS PEACE THAT THE SACRIFICE SHOULD BE MADE I ENTREATED HIM TO MAKE IT I SAID IT WOULD LIGHTEN THE LOAD OF HIS LIFEI HOPE IT WILLAND THAT IT WOULD GIVE ME INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES OF BEING HIS COMPANION OH TROTWOOD CRIED AGNES PUTTING HER HANDS BEFORE HER FACE AS HER TEARS STARTED ON IT I ALMOST FEEL AS IF I HAD BEEN PAPAS ENEMY INSTEAD OF HIS LOVING CHILD FOR I KNOW HOW HE HAS ALTERED IN HIS DEVOTION TO ME I KNOW HOW HE HAS NARROWED THE CIRCLE OF HIS SYMPATHIES AND DUTIES IN THE CONCENTRATION OF HIS WHOLE MIND UPON ME I KNOW WHAT A MULTITUDE OF THINGS HE HAS SHUT OUT FOR MY SAKE AND HOW HIS ANXIOUS THOUGHTS OF ME HAVE SHADOWED HIS LIFE AND WEAKENED HIS STRENGTH AND ENERGY BY TURNING THEM ALWAYS UPON ONE IDEA IF I COULD EVER SET THIS RIGHT IF I COULD EVER WORK OUT HIS RESTORATION AS I HAVE SO INNOCENTLY BEEN THE CAUSE OF HIS DECLINE I HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN AGNES CRY I HAD SEEN TEARS IN HER EYES WHEN I HAD BROUGHT NEW HONOURS HOME FROM SCHOOL AND I HAD SEEN THEM THERE WHEN WE LAST SPOKE ABOUT HER FATHER AND I HAD SEEN HER TURN HER GENTLE HEAD ASIDE WHEN WE TOOK LEAVE OF ONE ANOTHER BUT I HAD NEVER SEEN HER GRIEVE LIKE THIS IT MADE ME SO SORRY THAT I COULD ONLY SAY IN A FOOLISH HELPLESS MANNER PRAY AGNES DONT DONT MY DEAR SISTER BUT AGNES WAS TOO SUPERIOR TO ME IN CHARACTER AND PURPOSE AS I KNOW WELL NOW WHATEVER I MIGHT KNOW OR NOT KNOW THEN TO BE LONG IN NEED OF MY ENTREATIES THE BEAUTIFUL CALM MANNER WHICH MAKES HER SO DIFFERENT IN MY REMEMBRANCE FROM EVERYBODY ELSE CAME BACK AGAIN AS IF A CLOUD HAD PASSED FROM A SERENE SKY WE ARE NOT LIKELY TO REMAIN ALONE MUCH LONGER SAID AGNES AND WHILE I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY LET ME EARNESTLY ENTREAT YOU TROTWOOD TO BE FRIENDLY TO URIAH DONT REPEL HIM DONT RESENT AS I THINK YOU HAVE A GENERAL DISPOSITION TO DO WHAT MAY BE UNCONGENIAL TO YOU IN HIM HE MAY NOT DESERVE IT FOR WE KNOW NO CERTAIN ILL OF HIM IN ANY CASE THINK FIRST OF PAPA AND ME AGNES HAD NO TIME TO SAY MORE FOR THE ROOM DOOR OPENED AND MRS WATERBROOK WHO WAS A LARGE LADYOR WHO WORE A LARGE DRESS I DONT EXACTLY KNOW WHICH FOR I DONT KNOW WHICH WAS DRESS AND WHICH WAS LADYCAME SAILING IN I HAD A DIM RECOLLECTION OF HAVING SEEN HER AT THE THEATRE AS IF I HAD SEEN HER IN A PALE MAGIC LANTERN BUT SHE APPEARED TO REMEMBER ME PERFECTLY AND STILL TO SUSPECT ME OF BEING IN A STATE OF INTOXICATION FINDING BY DEGREES HOWEVER THAT I WAS SOBER AND I HOPE THAT I WAS A MODEST YOUNG GENTLEMAN MRS WATERBROOK SOFTENED TOWARDS ME CONSIDERABLY AND INQUIRED FIRSTLY IF I WENT MUCH INTO THE PARKS AND SECONDLY IF I WENT MUCH INTO SOCIETY ON MY REPLYING TO BOTH THESE QUESTIONS IN THE NEGATIVE IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I FELL AGAIN IN HER GOOD OPINION BUT SHE CONCEALED THE FACT GRACEFULLY AND INVITED ME TO DINNER NEXT DAY I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND TOOK MY LEAVE MAKING A CALL ON URIAH IN THE OFFICE AS I WENT OUT AND LEAVING A CARD FOR HIM IN HIS ABSENCE WHEN I WENT TO DINNER NEXT DAY AND ON THE STREET DOOR BEING OPENED PLUNGED INTO A VAPOURBATH OF HAUNCH OF MUTTON I DIVINED THAT I WAS NOT THE ONLY GUEST FOR I IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED THE TICKETPORTER IN DISGUISE ASSISTING THE FAMILY SERVANT AND WAITING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TO CARRY UP MY NAME HE LOOKED TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY WHEN HE ASKED ME FOR IT CONFIDENTIALLY AS IF HE HAD NEVER SEEN ME BEFORE BUT WELL DID I KNOW HIM AND WELL DID HE KNOW ME CONSCIENCE MADE COWARDS OF US BOTH I FOUND MR WATERBROOK TO BE A MIDDLEAGED GENTLEMAN WITH A SHORT THROAT AND A GOOD DEAL OF SHIRTCOLLAR WHO ONLY WANTED A BLACK NOSE TO BE THE PORTRAIT OF A PUGDOG HE TOLD ME HE WAS HAPPY TO HAVE THE HONOUR OF MAKING MY ACQUAINTANCE AND WHEN I HAD PAID MY HOMAGE TO MRS WATERBROOK PRESENTED ME WITH MUCH CEREMONY TO A VERY AWFUL LADY IN A BLACK VELVET DRESS AND A GREAT BLACK VELVET HAT WHOM I REMEMBER AS LOOKING LIKE A NEAR RELATION OF HAMLETSSAY HIS AUNT MRS HENRY SPIKER WAS THIS LADYS NAME AND HER HUSBAND WAS THERE TOO SO COLD A MAN THAT HIS HEAD INSTEAD OF BEING GREY SEEMED TO BE SPRINKLED WITH HOARFROST IMMENSE DEFERENCE WAS SHOWN TO THE HENRY SPIKERS MALE AND FEMALE WHICH AGNES TOLD ME WAS ON ACCOUNT OF MR HENRY SPIKER BEING SOLICITOR TO SOMETHING OR TO SOMEBODY I FORGET WHAT OR WHICH REMOTELY CONNECTED WITH THE TREASURY I FOUND URIAH HEEP AMONG THE COMPANY IN A SUIT OF BLACK AND IN DEEP HUMILITY HE TOLD ME WHEN I SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM THAT HE WAS PROUD TO BE NOTICED BY ME AND THAT HE REALLY FELT OBLIGED TO ME FOR MY CONDESCENSION I COULD HAVE WISHED HE HAD BEEN LESS OBLIGED TO ME FOR HE HOVERED ABOUT ME IN HIS GRATITUDE ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WHENEVER I SAID A WORD TO AGNES WAS SURE WITH HIS SHADOWLESS EYES AND CADAVEROUS FACE TO BE LOOKING GAUNTLY DOWN UPON US FROM BEHIND THERE WERE OTHER GUESTSALL ICED FOR THE OCCASION AS IT STRUCK ME LIKE THE WINE BUT THERE WAS ONE WHO ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION BEFORE HE CAME IN ON ACCOUNT OF MY HEARING HIM ANNOUNCED AS MR TRADDLES MY MIND FLEW BACK TO SALEM HOUSE AND COULD IT BE TOMMY I THOUGHT WHO USED TO DRAW THE SKELETONS I LOOKED FOR MR TRADDLES WITH UNUSUAL INTEREST HE WAS A SOBER STEADYLOOKING YOUNG MAN OF RETIRING MANNERS WITH A COMIC HEAD OF HAIR AND EYES THAT WERE RATHER WIDE OPEN AND HE GOT INTO AN OBSCURE CORNER SO SOON THAT I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN MAKING HIM OUT AT LENGTH I HAD A GOOD VIEW OF HIM AND EITHER MY VISION DECEIVED ME OR IT WAS THE OLD UNFORTUNATE TOMMY I MADE MY WAY TO MR WATERBROOK AND SAID THAT I BELIEVED I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW THERE INDEED SAID MR WATERBROOK SURPRISED YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO HAVE BEEN AT SCHOOL WITH MR HENRY SPIKER OH I DONT MEAN HIM I RETURNED I MEAN THE GENTLEMAN NAMED TRADDLES OH AYE AYE INDEED SAID MY HOST WITH MUCH DIMINISHED INTEREST POSSIBLY IF ITS REALLY THE SAME PERSON SAID I GLANCING TOWARDS HIM IT WAS AT A PLACE CALLED SALEM HOUSE WHERE WE WERE TOGETHER AND HE WAS AN EXCELLENT FELLOW OH YES TRADDLES IS A GOOD FELLOW RETURNED MY HOST NODDING HIS HEAD WITH AN AIR OF TOLERATION TRADDLES IS QUITE A GOOD FELLOW ITS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE SAID I IT IS REALLY RETURNED MY HOST QUITE A COINCIDENCE THAT TRADDLES SHOULD BE HERE AT ALL AS TRADDLES WAS ONLY INVITED THIS MORNING WHEN THE PLACE AT TABLE INTENDED TO BE OCCUPIED BY MRS HENRY SPIKERS BROTHER BECAME VACANT IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS INDISPOSITION A VERY GENTLEMANLY MAN MRS HENRY SPIKERS BROTHER MR COPPERFIELD I MURMURED AN ASSENT WHICH WAS FULL OF FEELING CONSIDERING THAT I KNEW NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT HIM AND I INQUIRED WHAT MR TRADDLES WAS BY PROFESSION TRADDLES RETURNED MR WATERBROOK IS A YOUNG MAN READING FOR THE BAR YES HE IS QUITE A GOOD FELLOWNOBODYS ENEMY BUT HIS OWN IS HE HIS OWN ENEMY SAID I SORRY TO HEAR THIS WELL RETURNED MR WATERBROOK PURSING UP HIS MOUTH AND PLAYING WITH HIS WATCHCHAIN IN A COMFORTABLE PROSPEROUS SORT OF WAY I SHOULD SAY HE WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO STAND IN THEIR OWN LIGHT YES I SHOULD SAY HE WOULD NEVER FOR EXAMPLE BE WORTH FIVE HUNDRED POUND TRADDLES WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY A PROFESSIONAL FRIEND OH YES YES HE HAS A KIND OF TALENT FOR DRAWING BRIEFS AND STATING A CASE IN WRITING PLAINLY I AM ABLE TO THROW SOMETHING IN TRADDLESS WAY IN THE COURSE OF THE YEAR SOMETHINGFOR HIMCONSIDERABLE OH YES YES I WAS MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE AND SATISFIED MANNER IN WHICH MR WATERBROOK DELIVERED HIMSELF OF THIS LITTLE WORD YES EVERY NOW AND THEN THERE WAS WONDERFUL EXPRESSION IN IT IT COMPLETELY CONVEYED THE IDEA OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN BORN NOT TO SAY WITH A SILVER SPOON BUT WITH A SCALINGLADDER AND HAD GONE ON MOUNTING ALL THE HEIGHTS OF LIFE ONE AFTER ANOTHER UNTIL NOW HE LOOKED FROM THE TOP OF THE FORTIFICATIONS WITH THE EYE OF A PHILOSOPHER AND A PATRON ON THE PEOPLE DOWN IN THE TRENCHES MY REFLECTIONS ON THIS THEME WERE STILL IN PROGRESS WHEN DINNER WAS ANNOUNCED MR WATERBROOK WENT DOWN WITH HAMLETS AUNT MR HENRY SPIKER TOOK MRS WATERBROOK AGNES WHOM I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO TAKE MYSELF WAS GIVEN TO A SIMPERING FELLOW WITH WEAK LEGS URIAH TRADDLES AND I AS THE JUNIOR PART OF THE COMPANY WENT DOWN LAST HOW WE COULD I WAS NOT SO VEXED AT LOSING AGNES AS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN SINCE IT GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING MYSELF KNOWN TO TRADDLES ON THE STAIRS WHO GREETED ME WITH GREAT FERVOUR WHILE URIAH WRITHED WITH SUCH OBTRUSIVE SATISFACTION AND SELFABASEMENT THAT I COULD GLADLY HAVE PITCHED HIM OVER THE BANISTERS TRADDLES AND I WERE SEPARATED AT TABLE BEING BILLETED IN TWO REMOTE CORNERS HE IN THE GLARE OF A RED VELVET LADY I IN THE GLOOM OF HAMLETS AUNT THE DINNER WAS VERY LONG AND THE CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT THE ARISTOCRACYAND BLOOD MRS WATERBROOK REPEATEDLY TOLD US THAT IF SHE HAD A WEAKNESS IT WAS BLOOD IT OCCURRED TO ME SEVERAL TIMES THAT WE SHOULD HAVE GOT ON BETTER IF WE HAD NOT BEEN QUITE SO GENTEEL WE WERE SO EXCEEDINGLY GENTEEL THAT OUR SCOPE WAS VERY LIMITED A MR AND MRS GULPIDGE WERE OF THE PARTY WHO HAD SOMETHING TO DO AT SECONDHAND AT LEAST MR GULPIDGE HAD WITH THE LAW BUSINESS OF THE BANK AND WHAT WITH THE BANK AND WHAT WITH THE TREASURY WE WERE AS EXCLUSIVE AS THE COURT CIRCULAR TO MEND THE MATTER HAMLETS AUNT HAD THE FAMILY FAILING OF INDULGING IN SOLILOQUY AND HELD FORTH IN A DESULTORY MANNER BY HERSELF ON EVERY TOPIC THAT WAS INTRODUCED THESE WERE FEW ENOUGH TO BE SURE BUT AS WE ALWAYS FELL BACK UPON BLOOD SHE HAD AS WIDE A FIELD FOR ABSTRACT SPECULATION AS HER NEPHEW HIMSELF WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PARTY OF OGRES THE CONVERSATION ASSUMED SUCH A SANGUINE COMPLEXION I CONFESS I AM OF MRS WATERBROOKS OPINION SAID MR WATERBROOK WITH HIS WINEGLASS AT HIS EYE OTHER THINGS ARE ALL VERY WELL IN THEIR WAY BUT GIVE ME BLOOD OH THERE IS NOTHING OBSERVED HAMLETS AUNT SO SATISFACTORY TO ONE THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS SO MUCH ONES BEAUIDEAL OFOF ALL THAT SORT OF THING SPEAKING GENERALLY THERE ARE SOME LOW MINDS NOT MANY I AM HAPPY TO BELIEVE BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT WOULD PREFER TO DO WHAT I SHOULD CALL BOW DOWN BEFORE IDOLS POSITIVELY IDOLS BEFORE SERVICE INTELLECT AND SO ON BUT THESE ARE INTANGIBLE POINTS BLOOD IS NOT SO WE SEE BLOOD IN A NOSE AND WE KNOW IT WE MEET WITH IT IN A CHIN AND WE SAY THERE IT IS THATS BLOOD IT IS AN ACTUAL MATTER OF FACT WE POINT IT OUT IT ADMITS OF NO DOUBT THE SIMPERING FELLOW WITH THE WEAK LEGS WHO HAD TAKEN AGNES DOWN STATED THE QUESTION MORE DECISIVELY YET I THOUGHT OH YOU KNOW DEUCE TAKE IT SAID THIS GENTLEMAN LOOKING ROUND THE BOARD WITH AN IMBECILE SMILE WE CANT FOREGO BLOOD YOU KNOW WE MUST HAVE BLOOD YOU KNOW SOME YOUNG FELLOWS YOU KNOW MAY BE A LITTLE BEHIND THEIR STATION PERHAPS IN POINT OF EDUCATION AND BEHAVIOUR AND MAY GO A LITTLE WRONG YOU KNOW AND GET THEMSELVES AND OTHER PEOPLE INTO A VARIETY OF FIXESAND ALL THATBUT DEUCE TAKE IT ITS DELIGHTFUL TO REFLECT THAT THEYVE GOT BLOOD IN EM MYSELF ID RATHER AT ANY TIME BE KNOCKED DOWN BY A MAN WHO HAD GOT BLOOD IN HIM THAN ID BE PICKED UP BY A MAN WHO HADNT THIS SENTIMENT AS COMPRESSING THE GENERAL QUESTION INTO A NUTSHELL GAVE THE UTMOST SATISFACTION AND BROUGHT THE GENTLEMAN INTO GREAT NOTICE UNTIL THE LADIES RETIRED AFTER THAT I OBSERVED THAT MR GULPIDGE AND MR HENRY SPIKER WHO HAD HITHERTO BEEN VERY DISTANT ENTERED INTO A DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE AGAINST US THE COMMON ENEMY AND EXCHANGED A MYSTERIOUS DIALOGUE ACROSS THE TABLE FOR OUR DEFEAT AND OVERTHROW THAT AFFAIR OF THE FIRST BOND FOR FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS HAS NOT TAKEN THE COURSE THAT WAS EXPECTED SPIKER SAID MR GULPIDGE DO YOU MEAN THE D OF AS SAID MR SPIKER THE C OF BS SAID MR GULPIDGE MR SPIKER RAISED HIS EYEBROWS AND LOOKED MUCH CONCERNED WHEN THE QUESTION WAS REFERRED TO LORDI NEEDNT NAME HIM SAID MR GULPIDGE CHECKING HIMSELF I UNDERSTAND SAID MR SPIKER N MR GULPIDGE DARKLY NODDEDWAS REFERRED TO HIM HIS ANSWER WAS MONEY OR NO RELEASE LORD BLESS MY SOUL CRIED MR SPIKER MONEY OR NO RELEASE REPEATED MR GULPIDGE FIRMLY THE NEXT IN REVERSIONYOU UNDERSTAND ME K SAID MR SPIKER WITH AN OMINOUS LOOK K THEN POSITIVELY REFUSED TO SIGN HE WAS ATTENDED AT NEWMARKET FOR THAT PURPOSE AND HE POINTBLANK REFUSED TO DO IT MR SPIKER WAS SO INTERESTED THAT HE BECAME QUITE STONY SO THE MATTER RESTS AT THIS HOUR SAID MR GULPIDGE THROWING HIMSELF BACK IN HIS CHAIR OUR FRIEND WATERBROOK WILL EXCUSE ME IF I FORBEAR TO EXPLAIN MYSELF GENERALLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE INTERESTS INVOLVED MR WATERBROOK WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY AS IT APPEARED TO ME TO HAVE SUCH INTERESTS AND SUCH NAMES EVEN HINTED AT ACROSS HIS TABLE HE ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF GLOOMY INTELLIGENCE THOUGH I AM PERSUADED HE KNEW NO MORE ABOUT THE DISCUSSION THAN I DID AND HIGHLY APPROVED OF THE DISCRETION THAT HAD BEEN OBSERVED MR SPIKER AFTER THE RECEIPT OF SUCH A CONFIDENCE NATURALLY DESIRED TO FAVOUR HIS FRIEND WITH A CONFIDENCE OF HIS OWN THEREFORE THE FOREGOING DIALOGUE WAS SUCCEEDED BY ANOTHER IN WHICH IT WAS MR GULPIDGES TURN TO BE SURPRISED AND THAT BY ANOTHER IN WHICH THE SURPRISE CAME ROUND TO MR SPIKERS TURN AGAIN AND SO ON TURN AND TURN ABOUT ALL THIS TIME WE THE OUTSIDERS REMAINED OPPRESSED BY THE TREMENDOUS INTERESTS INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATION AND OUR HOST REGARDED US WITH PRIDE AS THE VICTIMS OF A SALUTARY AWE AND ASTONISHMENT I WAS VERY GLAD INDEED TO GET UPSTAIRS TO AGNES AND TO TALK WITH HER IN A CORNER AND TO INTRODUCE TRADDLES TO HER WHO WAS SHY BUT AGREEABLE AND THE SAME GOODNATURED CREATURE STILL AS HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE EARLY ON ACCOUNT OF GOING AWAY NEXT MORNING FOR A MONTH I HAD NOT NEARLY SO MUCH CONVERSATION WITH HIM AS I COULD HAVE WISHED BUT WE EXCHANGED ADDRESSES AND PROMISED OURSELVES THE PLEASURE OF ANOTHER MEETING WHEN HE SHOULD COME BACK TO TOWN HE WAS GREATLY INTERESTED TO HEAR THAT I KNEW STEERFORTH AND SPOKE OF HIM WITH SUCH WARMTH THAT I MADE HIM TELL AGNES WHAT HE THOUGHT OF HIM BUT AGNES ONLY LOOKED AT ME THE WHILE AND VERY SLIGHTLY SHOOK HER HEAD WHEN ONLY I OBSERVED HER AS SHE WAS NOT AMONG PEOPLE WITH WHOM I BELIEVED SHE COULD BE VERY MUCH AT HOME I WAS ALMOST GLAD TO HEAR THAT SHE WAS GOING AWAY WITHIN A FEW DAYS THOUGH I WAS SORRY AT THE PROSPECT OF PARTING FROM HER AGAIN SO SOON THIS CAUSED ME TO REMAIN UNTIL ALL THE COMPANY WERE GONE CONVERSING WITH HER AND HEARING HER SING WAS SUCH A DELIGHTFUL REMINDER TO ME OF MY HAPPY LIFE IN THE GRAVE OLD HOUSE SHE HAD MADE SO BEAUTIFUL THAT I COULD HAVE REMAINED THERE HALF THE NIGHT BUT HAVING NO EXCUSE FOR STAYING ANY LONGER WHEN THE LIGHTS OF MR WATERBROOKS SOCIETY WERE ALL SNUFFED OUT I TOOK MY LEAVE VERY MUCH AGAINST MY INCLINATION I FELT THEN MORE THAN EVER THAT SHE WAS MY BETTER ANGEL AND IF I THOUGHT OF HER SWEET FACE AND PLACID SMILE AS THOUGH THEY HAD SHONE ON ME FROM SOME REMOVED BEING LIKE AN ANGEL I HOPE I THOUGHT NO HARM I HAVE SAID THAT THE COMPANY WERE ALL GONE BUT I OUGHT TO HAVE EXCEPTED URIAH WHOM I DONT INCLUDE IN THAT DENOMINATION AND WHO HAD NEVER CEASED TO HOVER NEAR US HE WAS CLOSE BEHIND ME WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS HE WAS CLOSE BESIDE ME WHEN I WALKED AWAY FROM THE HOUSE SLOWLY FITTING HIS LONG SKELETON FINGERS INTO THE STILL LONGER FINGERS OF A GREAT GUY FAWKES PAIR OF GLOVES IT WAS IN NO DISPOSITION FOR URIAHS COMPANY BUT IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE ENTREATY AGNES HAD MADE TO ME THAT I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD COME HOME TO MY ROOMS AND HAVE SOME COFFEE OH REALLY MASTER COPPERFIELD HE REJOINEDI BEG YOUR PARDON MISTER COPPERFIELD BUT THE OTHER

PREVENT HIS KNOCKING HIS HEAD AGAINST ANYTHING AND REALLY HIS DAMP COLD HAND FELT SO LIKE A FROG IN MINE THAT I WAS TEMPTED TO DROP IT AND RUN AWAY AGNES AND HOSPITALITY PREVAILED HOWEVER AND I CONDUCTED HIM TO MY FIRESIDE WHEN I LIGHTED MY CANDLES HE FELL INTO MEEK TRANSPORTS WITH THE ROOM THAT WAS REVEALED TO HIM AND WHEN I HEATED THE COFFEE IN AN UNASSUMING BLOCKTIN VESSEL IN WHICH MRS CRUPP DELIGHTED TO PREPARE IT CHIEFLY I BELIEVE BECAUSE IT WAS NOT INTENDED FOR THE PURPOSE BEING A SHAVINGPOT AND BECAUSE THERE WAS A PATENT INVENTION OF GREAT PRICE MOULDERING AWAY IN THE PANTRY HE PROFESSED SO MUCH EMOTION THAT I COULD JOYFULLY HAVE SCALDED HIM OH REALLY MASTER COPPERFIELDI MEAN MISTER COPPERFIELD SAID URIAH TO SEE YOU WAITING UPON ME IS WHAT I NEVER COULD HAVE EXPECTED BUT ONE

EXPECTATIONS MASTER COPPERFIELDI SHOULD SAY MISTER COPPERFIELD AS HE SAT ON MY SOFA WITH HIS LONG KNEES DRAWN UP UNDER HIS COFFEECUP HIS HAT AND GLOVES UPON THE GROUND CLOSE TO HIM HIS SPOON GOING SOFTLY ROUND AND ROUND HIS SHADOWLESS RED EYES WHICH LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD SCORCHED THEIR LASHES OFF TURNED TOWARDS ME WITHOUT LOOKING AT ME THE DISAGREEABLE DINTS I HAVE FORMERLY DESCRIBED IN HIS NOSTRILS COMING AND GOING WITH HIS BREATH AND A SNAKY UNDULATION PERVADING HIS FRAME FROM HIS CHIN TO HIS BOOTS I DECIDED IN MY OWN MIND THAT I DISLIKED HIM INTENSELY IT MADE ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO

CUP MORE COFFEE SOMETHING IN THE EMPHASIS HE LAID UPON THE KINDLING OF THOSE SPARKS AND SOMETHING IN THE GLANCE HE DIRECTED AT ME AS HE SAID IT HAD MADE ME START AS IF I HAD SEEN HIM ILLUMINATED BY A BLAZE OF LIGHT RECALLED BY HIS REQUEST PREFERRED IN QUITE ANOTHER TONE OF VOICE I DID THE HONOURS OF THE SHAVINGPOT BUT I DID THEM WITH AN UNSTEADINESS OF HAND A SUDDEN SENSE OF BEING NO MATCH FOR HIM AND A PERPLEXED SUSPICIOUS ANXIETY AS TO WHAT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO SAY NEXT WHICH I FELT COULD NOT ESCAPE HIS OBSERVATION HE SAID NOTHING AT ALL HE STIRRED HIS COFFEE ROUND AND ROUND HE SIPPED IT HE FELT HIS CHIN SOFTLY WITH HIS GRISLY HAND HE LOOKED AT THE FIRE HE LOOKED ABOUT THE ROOM HE GASPED RATHER THAN SMILED AT ME HE WRITHED AND UNDULATED ABOUT IN HIS DEFERENTIAL SERVILITY HE STIRRED AND SIPPED AGAIN BUT HE LEFT THE RENEWAL OF THE CONVERSATION TO ME SO MR WICKFIELD SAID I AT LAST WHO IS WORTH FIVE HUNDRED OF YOUOR ME FOR MY LIFE I THINK I COULD NOT HAVE HELPED DIVIDING THAT PART OF

WHAT A WORTHY MAN HE IS MASTER COPPERFIELD TOO UNDER HIS THUMB UNDERHIS THUMB SAID URIAH VERY SLOWLY AS HE STRETCHED OUT HIS CRUELLOOKING HAND ABOVE MY TABLE AND PRESSED HIS OWN THUMB UPON IT UNTIL IT SHOOK AND SHOOK THE ROOM IF I HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO LOOK AT HIM WITH HIM SPLAY FOOT ON MR WICKFIELDS HEAD I THINK I COULD SCARCELY HAVE HATED HIM MORE OH DEAR YES MASTER COPPERFIELD HE PROCEEDED IN A SOFT VOICE MOST REMARKABLY CONTRASTING WITH THE ACTION OF HIS THUMB WHICH DID NOT DIMINISH ITS HARD PRESSURE IN THE LEAST DEGREE THERES NO DOUBT OF IT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOSS DISGRACE I DONT KNOW WHAT AT ALL MR WICKFIELD KNOWS IT I AM THE UMBLE INSTRUMENT OF UMBLY SERVING HIM AND HE PUTS ME ON AN EMINENCE I HARDLY COULD HAVE HOPED TO REACH HOW THANKFUL SHOULD I BE WITH HIS FACE TURNED TOWARDS ME AS HE FINISHED BUT WITHOUT LOOKING AT ME HE TOOK HIS CROOKED THUMB OFF THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD PLANTED IT AND SLOWLY AND THOUGHTFULLY SCRAPED HIS LANK JAW WITH IT AS IF HE WERE SHAVING HIMSELF I RECOLLECT WELL HOW INDIGNANTLY MY HEART BEAT AS I SAW HIS CRAFTY FACE WITH THE APPROPRIATELY RED LIGHT OF THE FIRE UPON IT PREPARING FOR SOMETHING ELSE MASTER COPPERFIELD HE BEGANBUT AM I KEEPING YOU

AGNES I DONT MIND TRUSTING YOU WITH MY SECRET MASTER COPPERFIELD FOR I HAVE ALWAYS OVERFLOWED TOWARDS YOU SINCE THE FIRST MOMENT I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEHOLDING YOU IN A PONYSHAY HAS BEEN IN MY BREAST FOR YEARS OH MASTER COPPERFIELD WITH WHAT A PURE AFFECTION DO I LOVE THE GROUND MY AGNES WALKS ON I BELIEVE I HAD A DELIRIOUS IDEA OF SEIZING THE REDHOT POKER OUT OF THE FIRE AND RUNNING HIM THROUGH WITH IT IT WENT FROM ME WITH A SHOCK LIKE A BALL FIRED FROM A RIFLE BUT THE IMAGE OF AGNES OUTRAGED BY SO MUCH AS A THOUGHT OF THIS REDHEADED ANIMALS REMAINED IN MY MIND WHEN I LOOKED AT HIM SITTING ALL AWRY AS IF HIS MEAN SOUL GRIPED HIS BODY AND MADE ME GIDDY HE SEEMED TO SWELL AND GROW BEFORE MY EYES THE ROOM SEEMED FULL OF THE ECHOES OF HIS VOICE AND THE STRANGE FEELING TO WHICH PERHAPS NO ONE IS QUITE A STRANGER THAT ALL THIS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE AT SOME INDEFINITE TIME AND THAT I KNEW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY NEXT TOOK POSSESSION OF ME A TIMELY OBSERVATION OF THE SENSE OF POWER THAT THERE WAS IN HIS FACE DID MORE TO BRING BACK TO MY REMEMBRANCE THE ENTREATY OF AGNES IN ITS FULL FORCE THAN ANY EFFORT I COULD HAVE MADE I ASKED HIM WITH A BETTER APPEARANCE OF COMPOSURE THAN I COULD HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE A MINUTE BEFORE WHETHER HE HAD MADE HIS FEELINGS KNOWN TO AGNES OH NO MASTER COPPERFIELD HE RETURNED OH DEAR NO NOT TO ANYONE BUT YOU YOU SEE I AM ONLY JUST EMERGING FROM MY LOWLY STATION I REST A GOOD DEAL OF HOPE ON HER OBSERVING HOW USEFUL I AM TO HER FATHER FOR I TRUST TO BE VERY USEFUL TO HIM INDEED MASTER COPPERFIELD AND HOW I SMOOTH THE WAY FOR HIM AND KEEP HIM STRAIGHT SHES SO MUCH ATTACHED TO HER FATHER MASTER COPPERFIELD OH WHAT A LOVELY THING IT IS IN A DAUGHTER THAT I THINK SHE MAY COME ON HIS ACCOUNT TO BE KIND TO ME I FATHOMED THE DEPTH OF THE RASCALS WHOLE SCHEME AND UNDERSTOOD WHY HE LAID IT BARE IF YOULL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO KEEP MY SECRET MASTER COPPERFIELD HE PURSUED AND NOT IN GENERAL TO GO AGAINST ME I SHALL TAKE IT AS A PARTICULAR FAVOUR YOU WOULDNT WISH TO MAKE UNPLEASANTNESS I KNOW WHAT A FRIENDLY HEART YOUVE GOT BUT HAVING ONLY KNOWN ME ON MY UMBLE FOOTING ON MY UMBLEST I SHOULD SAY FOR I AM VERY UMBLE STILL YOU MIGHT UNBEKNOWN GO AGAINST ME RATHER WITH MY AGNES I CALL HER MINE YOU SEE MASTER COPPERFIELD THERES A SONG THAT SAYS ID CROWNS RESIGN TO CALL HER MINE I HOPE TO DO IT ONE OF THESE DAYS DEAR AGNES SO MUCH TOO LOVING AND TOO GOOD FOR ANYONE THAT I COULD THINK OF WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE WAS RESERVED TO BE THE WIFE OF SUCH A WRETCH AS THIS THERES NO HURRY AT PRESENT YOU KNOW MASTER COPPERFIELD URIAH PROCEEDED IN HIS SLIMY WAY AS I SAT GAZING AT HIM WITH THIS THOUGHT IN MY MIND MY AGNES IS VERY YOUNG STILL AND MOTHER AND ME WILL HAVE TO WORK OUR WAY UPWARDS AND MAKE A GOOD MANY NEW ARRANGEMENTS BEFORE IT WOULD BE QUITE CONVENIENT SO I SHALL HAVE TIME GRADUALLY TO MAKE HER FAMILIAR WITH MY HOPES AS OPPORTUNITIES OFFER OH IM SO MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR THIS CONFIDENCE OH ITS SUCH A RELIEF YOU CANT THINK TO KNOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR SITUATION AND ARE CERTAIN AS YOU WOULDNT WISH TO MAKE UNPLEASANTNESS IN THE FAMILY NOT TO GO AGAINST ME HE TOOK THE HAND WHICH I DARED NOT WITHHOLD AND HAVING GIVEN IT A DAMP SQUEEZE REFERRED TO HIS PALEFACED WATCH DEAR ME HE SAID ITS PAST ONE THE MOMENTS SLIP AWAY SO IN THE CONFIDENCE OF OLD TIMES MASTER COPPERFIELD THAT ITS ALMOST HALF PAST ONE I ANSWERED THAT I HAD THOUGHT IT WAS LATER NOT THAT I HAD REALLY THOUGHT SO BUT BECAUSE MY CONVERSATIONAL POWERS WERE EFFECTUALLY SCATTERED DEAR ME HE SAID CONSIDERING THE OUSE THAT I AM STOPPING ATA SORT OF A PRIVATE HOTEL AND BOARDING OUSE MASTER COPPERFIELD NEAR THE NEW RIVER EDWILL HAVE GONE TO BED THESE TWO HOURS I AM SORRY I RETURNED THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE BED HERE AND THAT I OH DONT THINK OF MENTIONING BEDS MASTER COPPERFIELD HE REJOINED ECSTATICALLY DRAWING UP ONE LEG BUT WOULD YOU HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS TO MY LAYING DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE IF IT COMES TO THAT I SAID PRAY TAKE MY BED AND ILL LIE DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE HIS REPUDIATION OF THIS OFFER WAS ALMOST SHRILL ENOUGH IN THE EXCESS OF ITS SURPRISE AND HUMILITY TO HAVE PENETRATED TO THE EARS OF MRS CRUPP THEN SLEEPING I SUPPOSE IN A DISTANT CHAMBER SITUATED AT ABOUT THE LEVEL OF LOWWATER MARK SOOTHED IN HER SLUMBERS BY THE TICKING OF AN INCORRIGIBLE CLOCK TO WHICH SHE ALWAYS REFERRED ME WHEN WE HAD ANY LITTLE DIFFERENCE ON THE SCORE OF PUNCTUALITY AND WHICH WAS NEVER LESS THAN THREEQUARTERS OF AN HOUR TOO SLOW AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN PUT RIGHT IN THE MORNING BY THE BEST AUTHORITIES AS NO ARGUMENTS I COULD URGE IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION HAD THE LEAST EFFECT UPON HIS MODESTY IN INDUCING HIM TO ACCEPT MY BEDROOM I WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE THE BEST ARRANGEMENTS I COULD FOR HIS REPOSE BEFORE THE FIRE THE MATTRESS OF THE SOFA WHICH WAS A GREAT DEAL TOO SHORT FOR HIS LANK FIGURE THE SOFA PILLOWS A BLANKET THE TABLECOVER A CLEAN BREAKFASTCLOTH AND A GREATCOAT MADE HIM A BED AND COVERING FOR WHICH HE WAS MORE THAN THANKFUL HAVING LENT HIM A NIGHTCAP WHICH HE PUT ON AT ONCE AND IN WHICH HE MADE SUCH AN AWFUL FIGURE THAT I HAVE NEVER WORN ONE SINCE I LEFT HIM TO HIS REST I NEVER SHALL FORGET THAT NIGHT I NEVER SHALL FORGET HOW I TURNED AND TUMBLED HOW I WEARIED MYSELF WITH THINKING ABOUT AGNES AND THIS CREATURE HOW I CONSIDERED WHAT COULD I DO AND WHAT OUGHT I TO DO HOW I COULD COME TO NO OTHER CONCLUSION THAN THAT THE BEST COURSE FOR HER PEACE WAS TO DO NOTHING AND TO KEEP TO MYSELF WHAT I HAD HEARD IF I WENT TO SLEEP FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE IMAGE OF AGNES WITH HER TENDER EYES AND OF HER FATHER LOOKING FONDLY ON HER AS I HAD SO OFTEN SEEN HIM LOOK AROSE BEFORE ME WITH APPEALING FACES AND FILLED ME WITH VAGUE TERRORS WHEN I AWOKE THE RECOLLECTION THAT URIAH WAS LYING IN THE NEXT ROOM SAT HEAVY ON ME LIKE A WAKING NIGHTMARE AND OPPRESSED ME WITH A LEADEN DREAD AS IF I HAD HAD SOME MEANER QUALITY OF DEVIL FOR A LODGER THE POKER GOT INTO MY DOZING THOUGHTS BESIDES AND WOULDNT COME OUT I THOUGHT BETWEEN SLEEPING AND WAKING THAT IT WAS STILL RED HOT AND I HAD SNATCHED IT OUT OF THE FIRE AND RUN HIM THROUGH THE BODY I WAS SO HAUNTED AT LAST BY THE IDEA THOUGH I KNEW THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT THAT I STOLE INTO THE NEXT ROOM TO LOOK AT HIM THERE I SAW HIM LYING ON HIS BACK WITH HIS LEGS EXTENDING TO I DONT KNOW WHERE GURGLINGS TAKING PLACE IN HIS THROAT STOPPAGES IN HIS NOSE AND HIS MOUTH OPEN LIKE A POSTOFFICE HE WAS SO MUCH WORSE IN REALITY THAN IN MY DISTEMPERED FANCY THAT AFTERWARDS I WAS ATTRACTED TO HIM IN VERY REPULSION AND COULD NOT HELP WANDERING IN AND OUT EVERY HALFHOUR OR SO AND TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT HIM STILL THE LONG LONG NIGHT SEEMED HEAVY AND HOPELESS AS EVER AND NO PROMISE OF DAY WAS IN THE MURKY SKY WHEN I SAW HIM GOING DOWNSTAIRS EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR THANK HEAVEN HE WOULD NOT STAY TO BREAKFAST IT APPEARED TO ME AS IF THE NIGHT WAS GOING AWAY IN HIS PERSON WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE COMMONS I CHARGED MRS CRUPP WITH PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS TO LEAVE THE WINDOWS OPEN THAT MY SITTINGROOM MIGHT BE AIRED AND PURGED OF HIS PRESENCE CHAPTER I FALL INTO CAPTIVITY I SAW NO MORE OF URIAH HEEP UNTIL THE DAY WHEN AGNES LEFT TOWN I WAS AT THE COACH OFFICE TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER AND SEE HER GO AND THERE WAS HE RETURNING TO CANTERBURY BY THE SAME CONVEYANCE IT WAS SOME SMALL SATISFACTION TO ME TO OBSERVE HIS SPARE SHORTWAISTED HIGHSHOULDERED MULBERRYCOLOURED GREATCOAT PERCHED UP IN COMPANY WITH AN UMBRELLA LIKE A SMALL TENT ON THE EDGE OF THE BACK SEAT ON THE ROOF WHILE AGNES WAS OF COURSE INSIDE BUT WHAT I UNDERWENT IN MY EFFORTS TO BE FRIENDLY WITH HIM WHILE AGNES LOOKED ON PERHAPS DESERVED THAT LITTLE RECOMPENSE AT THE COACH WINDOW AS AT THE DINNERPARTY HE HOVERED ABOUT US WITHOUT A MOMENTS INTERMISSION LIKE A GREAT VULTURE GORGING HIMSELF ON EVERY SYLLABLE THAT I SAID TO AGNES OR AGNES SAID TO ME IN THE STATE OF TROUBLE INTO WHICH HIS DISCLOSURE BY MY FIRE HAD THROWN ME I HAD THOUGHT VERY MUCH OF THE WORDS AGNES HAD USED IN REFERENCE TO THE PARTNERSHIP I DID WHAT I HOPE WAS RIGHT FEELING SURE THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR PAPAS PEACE THAT THE SACRIFICE SHOULD BE MADE I ENTREATED HIM TO MAKE IT A MISERABLE FOREBODING THAT SHE WOULD YIELD TO AND SUSTAIN HERSELF BY THE SAME FEELING IN REFERENCE TO ANY SACRIFICE FOR HIS SAKE HAD OPPRESSED ME EVER SINCE I KNEW HOW SHE LOVED HIM I KNEW WHAT THE DEVOTION OF HER NATURE WAS I KNEW FROM HER OWN LIPS THAT SHE REGARDED HERSELF AS THE INNOCENT CAUSE OF HIS ERRORS AND AS OWING HIM A GREAT DEBT SHE ARDENTLY DESIRED TO PAY I HAD NO CONSOLATION IN SEEING HOW DIFFERENT SHE WAS FROM THIS DETESTABLE RUFUS WITH THE MULBERRYCOLOURED GREATCOAT FOR I FELT THAT IN THE VERY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IN THE SELFDENIAL OF HER PURE SOUL AND THE SORDID BASENESS OF HIS THE GREATEST DANGER LAY ALL THIS DOUBTLESS HE KNEW THOROUGHLY AND HAD IN HIS CUNNING CONSIDERED WELL YET I WAS SO CERTAIN THAT THE PROSPECT OF SUCH A SACRIFICE AFAR OFF MUST DESTROY THE HAPPINESS OF AGNES AND I WAS SO SURE FROM HER MANNER OF ITS BEING UNSEEN BY HER THEN AND HAVING CAST NO SHADOW ON HER YET THAT I COULD AS SOON HAVE INJURED HER AS GIVEN HER ANY WARNING OF WHAT IMPENDED THUS IT WAS THAT WE PARTED WITHOUT EXPLANATION SHE WAVING HER HAND AND SMILING FAREWELL FROM THE COACH WINDOW HER EVIL GENIUS WRITHING ON THE ROOF AS IF HE HAD HER IN HIS CLUTCHES AND TRIUMPHED I COULD NOT GET OVER THIS FAREWELL GLIMPSE OF THEM FOR A LONG TIME WHEN AGNES WROTE TO TELL ME OF HER SAFE ARRIVAL I WAS AS MISERABLE AS WHEN I SAW HER GOING AWAY WHENEVER I FELL INTO A THOUGHTFUL STATE THIS SUBJECT WAS SURE TO PRESENT ITSELF AND ALL MY UNEASINESS WAS SURE TO BE REDOUBLED HARDLY A NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT MY DREAMING OF IT IT BECAME A PART OF MY LIFE AND AS INSEPARABLE FROM MY LIFE AS MY OWN HEAD I HAD AMPLE LEISURE TO REFINE UPON MY UNEASINESS FOR STEERFORTH WAS AT OXFORD AS HE WROTE TO ME AND WHEN I WAS NOT AT THE COMMONS I WAS VERY MUCH ALONE I BELIEVE I HAD AT THIS TIME SOME LURKING DISTRUST OF STEERFORTH I WROTE TO HIM MOST AFFECTIONATELY IN REPLY TO HIS BUT I THINK I WAS GLAD UPON THE WHOLE THAT HE COULD NOT COME TO LONDON JUST THEN I SUSPECT THE TRUTH TO BE THAT THE INFLUENCE OF AGNES WAS UPON ME UNDISTURBED BY THE SIGHT OF HIM AND THAT IT WAS THE MORE POWERFUL WITH ME BECAUSE SHE HAD SO LARGE A SHARE IN MY THOUGHTS AND INTEREST IN THE MEANTIME DAYS AND WEEKS SLIPPED AWAY I WAS ARTICLED TO SPENLOW AND JORKINS I HAD NINETY POUNDS A YEAR EXCLUSIVE OF MY HOUSERENT AND SUNDRY COLLATERAL MATTERS FROM MY AUNT MY ROOMS WERE ENGAGED FOR TWELVE MONTHS CERTAIN AND THOUGH I STILL FOUND THEM DREARY OF AN EVENING AND THE EVENINGS LONG I COULD SETTLE DOWN INTO A STATE OF EQUABLE LOW SPIRITS AND RESIGN MYSELF TO COFFEE WHICH I SEEM ON LOOKING BACK TO HAVE TAKEN BY THE GALLON AT ABOUT THIS PERIOD OF MY EXISTENCE AT ABOUT THIS TIME TOO I MADE THREE DISCOVERIES FIRST THAT MRS CRUPP WAS A MARTYR TO A CURIOUS DISORDER CALLED THE SPAZZUMS WHICH WAS GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED WITH INFLAMMATION OF THE NOSE AND REQUIRED TO BE CONSTANTLY TREATED WITH PEPPERMINT SECONDLY THAT SOMETHING PECULIAR IN THE TEMPERATURE OF MY PANTRY MADE THE BRANDYBOTTLES BURST THIRDLY THAT I WAS ALONE IN THE WORLD AND MUCH GIVEN TO RECORD THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IN FRAGMENTS OF ENGLISH VERSIFICATION ON THE DAY WHEN I WAS ARTICLED NO FESTIVITY TOOK PLACE BEYOND MY HAVING SANDWICHES AND SHERRY INTO THE OFFICE FOR THE CLERKS AND GOING ALONE TO THE THEATRE AT NIGHT I WENT TO SEE THE STRANGER AS A DOCTORS COMMONS SORT OF PLAY AND WAS SO DREADFULLY CUT UP THAT I HARDLY KNEW MYSELF IN MY OWN GLASS WHEN I GOT HOME MR SPENLOW REMARKED ON THIS OCCASION WHEN WE CONCLUDED OUR BUSINESS THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO HAVE SEEN ME AT HIS HOUSE AT NORWOOD TO CELEBRATE OUR BECOMING CONNECTED BUT FOR HIS DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS BEING IN SOME DISORDER ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXPECTED RETURN OF HIS DAUGHTER FROM FINISHING HER EDUCATION AT PARIS BUT HE INTIMATED THAT WHEN SHE CAME HOME HE SHOULD HOPE TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ENTERTAINING ME I KNEW THAT HE WAS A WIDOWER WITH ONE DAUGHTER AND EXPRESSED MY ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MR SPENLOW WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD IN A WEEK OR TWO HE REFERRED TO THIS ENGAGEMENT AND SAID THAT IF I WOULD DO HIM THE FAVOUR TO COME DOWN NEXT SATURDAY AND STAY TILL MONDAY HE WOULD BE EXTREMELY HAPPY OF COURSE I SAID I WOULD DO HIM THE FAVOUR AND HE WAS TO DRIVE ME DOWN IN HIS PHAETON AND TO BRING ME BACK WHEN THE DAY ARRIVED MY VERY CARPETBAG WAS AN OBJECT OF VENERATION TO THE STIPENDIARY CLERKS TO WHOM THE HOUSE AT NORWOOD WAS A SACRED MYSTERY ONE OF THEM INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT MR SPENLOW ATE ENTIRELY OFF PLATE AND CHINA AND ANOTHER HINTED AT CHAMPAGNE BEING CONSTANTLY ON DRAUGHT AFTER THE USUAL CUSTOM OF TABLEBEER THE OLD CLERK WITH THE WIG WHOSE NAME WAS MR TIFFEY HAD BEEN DOWN ON BUSINESS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER AND HAD ON EACH OCCASION PENETRATED TO THE BREAKFASTPARLOUR HE DESCRIBED IT AS AN APARTMENT OF THE MOST SUMPTUOUS NATURE AND SAID THAT HE HAD DRUNK BROWN EAST INDIA SHERRY THERE OF A QUALITY SO PRECIOUS AS TO MAKE A MAN WINK WE HAD AN ADJOURNED CAUSE IN THE CONSISTORY THAT DAYABOUT EXCOMMUNICATING A BAKER WHO HAD BEEN OBJECTING IN A VESTRY TO A PAVINGRATEAND AS THE EVIDENCE WAS JUST TWICE THE LENGTH OF ROBINSON CRUSOE ACCORDING TO A CALCULATION I MADE IT WAS RATHER LATE IN THE DAY BEFORE WE FINISHED HOWEVER WE GOT HIM EXCOMMUNICATED FOR SIX WEEKS AND SENTENCED IN NO END OF COSTS AND THEN THE BAKERS PROCTOR AND THE JUDGE AND THE ADVOCATES ON BOTH SIDES WHO WERE ALL NEARLY RELATED WENT OUT OF TOWN TOGETHER AND MR SPENLOW AND I DROVE AWAY IN THE PHAETON THE PHAETON WAS A VERY HANDSOME AFFAIR THE HORSES ARCHED THEIR NECKS AND LIFTED UP THEIR LEGS AS IF THEY KNEW THEY BELONGED TO DOCTORS COMMONS THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF COMPETITION IN THE COMMONS ON ALL POINTS OF DISPLAY AND IT TURNED OUT SOME VERY CHOICE EQUIPAGES THEN THOUGH I ALWAYS HAVE CONSIDERED AND ALWAYS SHALL CONSIDER THAT IN MY TIME THE GREAT ARTICLE OF COMPETITION THERE WAS STARCH WHICH I THINK WAS WORN AMONG THE PROCTORS TO AS GREAT AN EXTENT AS IT IS IN THE NATURE OF MAN TO BEAR WE WERE VERY PLEASANT GOING DOWN AND MR SPENLOW GAVE ME SOME HINTS IN REFERENCE TO MY PROFESSION HE SAID IT WAS THE GENTEELEST PROFESSION IN THE WORLD AND MUST ON NO ACCOUNT BE CONFOUNDED WITH THE PROFESSION OF A SOLICITOR BEING QUITE ANOTHER SORT OF THING INFINITELY MORE EXCLUSIVE LESS MECHANICAL AND MORE PROFITABLE WE TOOK THINGS MUCH MORE EASILY IN THE COMMONS THAN THEY COULD BE TAKEN ANYWHERE ELSE HE OBSERVED AND THAT SET US AS A PRIVILEGED CLASS APART HE SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEAL THE DISAGREEABLE FACT THAT WE WERE CHIEFLY EMPLOYED BY SOLICITORS BUT HE GAVE ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WERE AN INFERIOR RACE OF MEN UNIVERSALLY LOOKED DOWN UPON BY ALL PROCTORS OF ANY PRETENSIONS I ASKED MR SPENLOW WHAT HE CONSIDERED THE BEST SORT OF PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS HE REPLIED THAT A GOOD CASE OF A DISPUTED WILL WHERE THERE WAS A NEAT LITTLE ESTATE OF THIRTY OR FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS WAS PERHAPS THE BEST OF ALL IN SUCH A CASE HE SAID NOT ONLY WERE THERE VERY PRETTY PICKINGS IN THE WAY OF ARGUMENTS AT EVERY STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND MOUNTAINS UPON MOUNTAINS OF EVIDENCE ON INTERROGATORY AND COUNTERINTERROGATORY TO SAY NOTHING OF AN APPEAL LYING FIRST TO THE DELEGATES AND THEN TO THE LORDS BUT THE COSTS BEING PRETTY SURE TO COME OUT OF THE ESTATE AT LAST BOTH SIDES WENT AT IT IN A LIVELY AND SPIRITED MANNER AND EXPENSE WAS NO CONSIDERATION THEN HE LAUNCHED INTO A GENERAL EULOGIUM ON THE COMMONS WHAT WAS TO BE PARTICULARLY ADMIRED HE SAID IN THE COMMONS WAS ITS COMPACTNESS IT WAS THE MOST CONVENIENTLY ORGANIZED PLACE IN THE WORLD IT WAS THE COMPLETE IDEA OF SNUGNESS IT LAY IN A NUTSHELL FOR EXAMPLE YOU BROUGHT A DIVORCE CASE OR A RESTITUTION CASE INTO THE CONSISTORY VERY GOOD YOU TRIED IT IN THE CONSISTORY YOU MADE A QUIET LITTLE ROUND GAME OF IT AMONG A FAMILY GROUP AND YOU PLAYED IT OUT AT LEISURE SUPPOSE YOU WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE CONSISTORY WHAT DID YOU DO THEN WHY YOU WENT INTO THE ARCHES WHAT WAS THE ARCHES THE SAME COURT IN THE SAME ROOM WITH THE SAME BAR AND THE SAME PRACTITIONERS BUT ANOTHER JUDGE FOR THERE THE CONSISTORY JUDGE COULD PLEAD ANY COURTDAY AS AN ADVOCATE WELL YOU PLAYED YOUR ROUND GAME OUT AGAIN STILL YOU WERE NOT SATISFIED VERY GOOD WHAT DID YOU DO THEN WHY YOU WENT TO THE DELEGATES WHO WERE THE DELEGATES WHY THE ECCLESIASTICAL DELEGATES WERE THE ADVOCATES WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS WHO HAD LOOKED ON AT THE ROUND GAME WHEN IT WAS PLAYING IN BOTH COURTS AND HAD SEEN THE CARDS SHUFFLED AND CUT AND PLAYED AND HAD TALKED TO ALL THE PLAYERS ABOUT IT AND NOW CAME FRESH AS JUDGES TO SETTLE THE MATTER TO THE SATISFACTION OF EVERYBODY DISCONTENTED PEOPLE MIGHT TALK OF CORRUPTION IN THE COMMONS CLOSENESS IN THE COMMONS AND THE NECESSITY OF REFORMING THE COMMONS SAID MR SPENLOW SOLEMNLY IN CONCLUSION BUT WHEN THE PRICE OF WHEAT PER BUSHEL HAD BEEN HIGHEST THE COMMONS HAD BEEN BUSIEST AND A MAN MIGHT LAY HIS HAND UPON HIS HEART AND SAY THIS TO THE WHOLE WORLDTOUCH THE COMMONS AND DOWN COMES THE COUNTRY I LISTENED TO ALL THIS WITH ATTENTION AND THOUGH I MUST SAY I HAD MY DOUBTS WHETHER THE COUNTRY WAS QUITE AS MUCH OBLIGED TO THE COMMONS AS MR SPENLOW MADE OUT I RESPECTFULLY DEFERRED TO HIS OPINION THAT ABOUT THE PRICE OF WHEAT PER BUSHEL I MODESTLY FELT WAS TOO MUCH FOR MY STRENGTH AND QUITE SETTLED THE QUESTION I HAVE NEVER TO THIS HOUR GOT THE BETTER OF THAT BUSHEL OF WHEAT IT HAS REAPPEARED TO ANNIHILATE ME ALL THROUGH MY LIFE IN CONNEXION WITH ALL KINDS OF SUBJECTS I DONT KNOW NOW EXACTLY WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH ME OR WHAT RIGHT IT HAS TO CRUSH ME ON AN INFINITE VARIETY OF OCCASIONS BUT WHENEVER I SEE MY OLD FRIEND THE BUSHEL BROUGHT IN BY THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS AS HE ALWAYS IS I OBSERVE I GIVE UP A SUBJECT FOR LOST THIS IS A DIGRESSION I WAS NOT THE MAN TO TOUCH THE COMMONS AND BRING DOWN THE COUNTRY I SUBMISSIVELY EXPRESSED BY MY SILENCE MY ACQUIESCENCE IN ALL I HAD HEARD FROM MY SUPERIOR IN YEARS AND KNOWLEDGE AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE STRANGER AND THE DRAMA AND THE PAIRS OF HORSES UNTIL WE CAME TO MR SPENLOWS GATE THERE WAS A LOVELY GARDEN TO MR SPENLOWS HOUSE AND THOUGH THAT WAS NOT THE BEST TIME OF THE YEAR FOR SEEING A GARDEN IT WAS SO BEAUTIFULLY KEPT THAT I WAS QUITE ENCHANTED THERE WAS A CHARMING LAWN THERE WERE CLUSTERS OF TREES AND THERE WERE PERSPECTIVE WALKS THAT I COULD JUST DISTINGUISH IN THE DARK ARCHED OVER WITH TRELLISWORK ON WHICH SHRUBS AND FLOWERS GREW IN THE GROWING SEASON HERE MISS SPENLOW WALKS BY HERSELF I THOUGHT DEAR ME WE WENT INTO THE HOUSE WHICH WAS CHEERFULLY LIGHTED UP AND INTO A HALL WHERE THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF HATS CAPS GREATCOATS PLAIDS GLOVES WHIPS AND WALKINGSTICKS WHERE IS MISS DORA SAID MR SPENLOW TO THE SERVANT DORA I THOUGHT WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME WE TURNED INTO A ROOM NEAR AT HAND I THINK IT WAS THE IDENTICAL BREAKFASTROOM MADE MEMORABLE BY THE BROWN EAST INDIAN SHERRY AND I HEARD A VOICE SAY MR COPPERFIELD MY DAUGHTER DORA AND MY DAUGHTER DORAS CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND IT WAS NO DOUBT MR SPENLOWS VOICE BUT I DIDNT KNOW IT AND I DIDNT CARE WHOSE IT WAS ALL WAS OVER IN A MOMENT I HAD FULFILLED MY DESTINY I WAS A CAPTIVE AND A SLAVE I LOVED DORA SPENLOW TO DISTRACTION SHE WAS MORE THAN HUMAN TO ME SHE WAS A FAIRY A SYLPH I DONT KNOW WHAT SHE WASANYTHING THAT NO ONE EVER SAW AND EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY EVER WANTED I WAS SWALLOWED UP IN AN ABYSS OF LOVE IN AN INSTANT THERE WAS NO PAUSING ON THE BRINK NO LOOKING DOWN OR LOOKING BACK I WAS GONE HEADLONG BEFORE I HAD SENSE TO SAY A WORD TO HER I OBSERVED A WELLREMEMBERED VOICE WHEN I HAD BOWED AND MURMURED SOMETHING HAVE SEEN MR COPPERFIELD BEFORE THE SPEAKER WAS NOT DORA NO THE CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND MISS MURDSTONE I DONT THINK I WAS MUCH ASTONISHED TO THE BEST OF MY JUDGEMENT NO CAPACITY OF ASTONISHMENT WAS LEFT IN ME THERE WAS NOTHING WORTH MENTIONING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD BUT DORA SPENLOW TO BE ASTONISHED ABOUT I SAID HOW DO YOU DO MISS MURDSTONE I HOPE YOU ARE WELL SHE ANSWERED VERY WELL I SAID HOW IS MR MURDSTONE SHE REPLIED MY BROTHER IS ROBUST I AM OBLIGED TO YOU MR SPENLOW WHO I SUPPOSE HAD BEEN SURPRISED TO SEE US RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER THEN PUT IN HIS WORD I AM GLAD TO FIND HE SAID COPPERFIELD THAT YOU AND MISS MURDSTONE ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED MR COPPERFIELD AND MYSELF SAID MISS MURDSTONE WITH SEVERE COMPOSURE ARE CONNEXIONS WE WERE ONCE SLIGHTLY ACQUAINTED IT WAS IN HIS CHILDISH DAYS CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE SEPARATED US SINCE I SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN HIM I REPLIED THAT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN HER ANYWHERE WHICH WAS TRUE ENOUGH MISS MURDSTONE HAS HAD THE GOODNESS SAID MR SPENLOW TO ME TO ACCEPT THE OFFICEIF I MAY SO DESCRIBE ITOF MY DAUGHTER DORAS CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND MY DAUGHTER DORA HAVING UNHAPPILY NO MOTHER MISS MURDSTONE IS OBLIGING ENOUGH TO BECOME HER COMPANION AND PROTECTOR A PASSING THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME THAT MISS MURDSTONE LIKE THE POCKET INSTRUMENT CALLED A LIFEPRESERVER WAS NOT SO MUCH DESIGNED FOR PURPOSES OF PROTECTION AS OF ASSAULT BUT AS I HAD NONE BUT PASSING THOUGHTS FOR ANY SUBJECT SAVE DORA I GLANCED AT HER DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS AND WAS THINKING THAT I SAW IN HER PRETTILY PETTISH MANNER THAT SHE WAS NOT VERY MUCH INCLINED TO BE PARTICULARLY CONFIDENTIAL TO HER COMPANION AND PROTECTOR WHEN A BELL RANG WHICH MR SPENLOW SAID WAS THE FIRST DINNERBELL AND SO CARRIED ME OFF TO DRESS THE IDEA OF DRESSING ONES SELF OR DOING ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF ACTION IN THAT STATE OF LOVE WAS A LITTLE TOO RIDICULOUS I COULD ONLY SIT DOWN BEFORE MY FIRE BITING THE KEY OF MY CARPETBAG AND THINK OF THE CAPTIVATING GIRLISH BRIGHTEYED LOVELY DORA WHAT A FORM SHE HAD WHAT A FACE SHE HAD WHAT A GRACEFUL VARIABLE ENCHANTING MANNER THE BELL RANG AGAIN SO SOON THAT I MADE A MERE SCRAMBLE OF MY DRESSING INSTEAD OF THE CAREFUL OPERATION I COULD HAVE WISHED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS THERE WAS SOME COMPANY DORA WAS TALKING TO AN OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A GREY HEAD GREY AS HE WASAND A GREATGRANDFATHER INTO THE BARGAIN FOR HE SAID SOI WAS MADLY JEALOUS OF HIM WHAT A STATE OF MIND I WAS IN I WAS JEALOUS OF EVERYBODY I COULDNT BEAR THE IDEA OF ANYBODY KNOWING MR SPENLOW BETTER THAN I DID IT WAS TORTURING TO ME TO HEAR THEM TALK OF OCCURRENCES IN WHICH I HAD HAD NO SHARE WHEN A MOST AMIABLE PERSON WITH A HIGHLY POLISHED BALD HEAD ASKED ME ACROSS THE DINNER TABLE IF THAT WERE THE FIRST OCCASION OF MY SEEING THE GROUNDS I COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO HIM THAT WAS SAVAGE AND REVENGEFUL I DONT REMEMBER WHO WAS THERE EXCEPT DORA I HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA WHAT WE HAD FOR DINNER BESIDES DORA MY IMPRESSION IS THAT I DINED OFF DORA ENTIRELY AND SENT AWAY HALFADOZEN PLATES UNTOUCHED I SAT NEXT TO HER I TALKED TO HER SHE HAD THE MOST DELIGHTFUL LITTLE VOICE THE GAYEST LITTLE LAUGH THE PLEASANTEST AND MOST FASCINATING LITTLE WAYS THAT EVER LED A LOST YOUTH INTO HOPELESS SLAVERY SHE WAS RATHER DIMINUTIVE ALTOGETHER SO MUCH THE MORE PRECIOUS I THOUGHT WHEN SHE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM WITH MISS MURDSTONE NO OTHER LADIES WERE OF THE PARTY I FELL INTO A REVERIE ONLY DISTURBED BY THE CRUEL APPREHENSION THAT MISS MURDSTONE WOULD DISPARAGE ME TO HER THE AMIABLE CREATURE WITH THE POLISHED HEAD TOLD ME A LONG STORY WHICH I THINK WAS ABOUT GARDENING I THINK I HEARD HIM SAY MY GARDENER SEVERAL TIMES I SEEMED TO PAY THE DEEPEST ATTENTION TO HIM BUT I WAS WANDERING IN A GARDEN OF EDEN ALL THE WHILE WITH DORA MY APPREHENSIONS OF BEING DISPARAGED TO THE OBJECT OF MY ENGROSSING AFFECTION WERE REVIVED WHEN WE WENT INTO THE DRAWINGROOM BY THE GRIM AND DISTANT ASPECT OF MISS MURDSTONE BUT I WAS RELIEVED OF THEM IN AN UNEXPECTED MANNER DAVID COPPERFIELD SAID MISS MURDSTONE BECKONING ME ASIDE INTO A WINDOW A WORD I CONFRONTED MISS MURDSTONE ALONE DAVID COPPERFIELD SAID MISS MURDSTONE I NEED NOT ENLARGE UPON FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ARE NOT A TEMPTING SUBJECT FAR FROM IT MAAM I RETURNED FAR FROM IT ASSENTED MISS MURDSTONE I DO NOT WISH TO REVIVE THE MEMORY OF PAST DIFFERENCES OR OF PAST OUTRAGES I HAVE RECEIVED OUTRAGES FROM A PERSONA FEMALE I AM SORRY TO SAY FOR THE CREDIT OF MY SEXWHO IS NOT TO BE MENTIONED WITHOUT SCORN AND DISGUST AND THEREFORE I WOULD RATHER NOT MENTION HER I FELT VERY FIERY ON MY AUNTS ACCOUNT BUT I SAID IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE BETTER IF MISS MURDSTONE PLEASED NOT TO MENTION HER I COULD NOT HEAR HER DISRESPECTFULLY MENTIONED I ADDED WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY OPINION IN A DECIDED TONE MISS MURDSTONE SHUT HER EYES AND DISDAINFULLY INCLINED HER HEAD THEN SLOWLY OPENING HER EYES RESUMED DAVID COPPERFIELD I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DISGUISE THE FACT THAT I FORMED AN UNFAVOURABLE OPINION OF YOU IN YOUR CHILDHOOD IT MAY HAVE BEEN A MISTAKEN ONE OR YOU MAY HAVE CEASED TO JUSTIFY IT THAT IS NOT IN QUESTION BETWEEN US NOW I BELONG TO A FAMILY REMARKABLE I BELIEVE FOR SOME FIRMNESS AND I AM NOT THE CREATURE OF CIRCUMSTANCE OR CHANGE I MAY HAVE MY OPINION OF YOU YOU MAY HAVE YOUR OPINION OF ME I INCLINED MY HEAD IN MY TURN BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARY SAID MISS MURDSTONE THAT THESE OPINIONS SHOULD COME INTO COLLISION HERE UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS AS WELL ON ALL ACCOUNTS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT AS THE CHANCES OF LIFE HAVE BROUGHT US TOGETHER AGAIN AND MAY BRING US TOGETHER ON OTHER OCCASIONS I WOULD SAY LET US MEET HERE AS DISTANT ACQUAINTANCES FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES ARE A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR OUR ONLY MEETING ON THAT FOOTING AND IT IS QUITE UNNECESSARY THAT EITHER OF US SHOULD MAKE THE OTHER THE SUBJECT OF REMARK DO YOU APPROVE OF THIS MISS MURDSTONE I RETURNED I THINK YOU AND MR MURDSTONE USED ME VERY CRUELLY AND TREATED MY MOTHER WITH GREAT UNKINDNESS I SHALL ALWAYS THINK SO AS LONG AS I LIVE BUT I QUITE AGREE IN WHAT YOU PROPOSE MISS MURDSTONE SHUT HER EYES AGAIN AND BENT HER HEAD THEN JUST TOUCHING THE BACK OF MY HAND WITH THE TIPS OF HER COLD STIFF FINGERS SHE WALKED AWAY ARRANGING THE LITTLE FETTERS ON HER WRISTS AND ROUND HER NECK WHICH SEEMED TO BE THE SAME SET IN EXACTLY THE SAME STATE AS WHEN I HAD SEEN HER LAST THESE REMINDED ME IN REFERENCE TO MISS MURDSTONES NATURE OF THE FETTERS OVER A JAIL DOOR SUGGESTING ON THE OUTSIDE TO ALL BEHOLDERS WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED WITHIN ALL I KNOW OF THE REST OF THE EVENING IS THAT I HEARD THE EMPRESS OF MY HEART SING ENCHANTED BALLADS IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE GENERALLY TO THE EFFECT THAT WHATEVER WAS THE MATTER WE OUGHT ALWAYS TO DANCE TA RA LA TA RA LA ACCOMPANYING HERSELF ON A GLORIFIED INSTRUMENT RESEMBLING A GUITAR THAT I WAS LOST IN BLISSFUL DELIRIUM THAT I REFUSED REFRESHMENT THAT MY SOUL RECOILED FROM PUNCH PARTICULARLY THAT WHEN MISS MURDSTONE TOOK HER INTO CUSTODY AND LED HER AWAY SHE SMILED AND GAVE ME HER DELICIOUS HAND THAT I CAUGHT A VIEW OF MYSELF IN A MIRROR LOOKING PERFECTLY IMBECILE AND IDIOTIC THAT I RETIRED TO BED IN A MOST MAUDLIN STATE OF MIND AND GOT UP IN A CRISIS OF FEEBLE INFATUATION IT WAS A FINE MORNING AND EARLY AND I THOUGHT I WOULD GO AND TAKE A STROLL DOWN ONE OF THOSE WIREARCHED WALKS AND INDULGE MY PASSION BY DWELLING ON HER IMAGE ON MY WAY THROUGH THE HALL I ENCOUNTERED HER LITTLE DOG WHO WAS CALLED JIPSHORT FOR GIPSY I APPROACHED HIM TENDERLY FOR I LOVED EVEN HIM BUT HE SHOWED HIS WHOLE SET OF TEETH GOT UNDER A CHAIR EXPRESSLY TO SNARL AND WOULDNT HEAR OF THE LEAST FAMILIARITY THE GARDEN WAS COOL AND SOLITARY I WALKED ABOUT WONDERING WHAT MY FEELINGS OF HAPPINESS WOULD BE IF I COULD EVER BECOME ENGAGED TO THIS DEAR WONDER AS TO MARRIAGE AND FORTUNE AND ALL THAT I BELIEVE I WAS ALMOST AS INNOCENTLY UNDESIGNING THEN AS WHEN I LOVED LITTLE EMLY TO BE ALLOWED TO CALL HER DORA TO WRITE TO HER TO DOTE UPON AND WORSHIP HER TO HAVE REASON TO THINK THAT WHEN SHE WAS WITH OTHER PEOPLE SHE WAS YET MINDFUL OF ME SEEMED TO ME THE SUMMIT OF HUMAN AMBITIONI AM SURE IT WAS THE SUMMIT OF MINE THERE IS NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT I WAS A LACKADAISICAL YOUNG SPOONEY BUT THERE WAS A PURITY OF HEART IN ALL THIS THAT PREVENTS MY HAVING QUITE A CONTEMPTUOUS RECOLLECTION OF IT LET ME LAUGH AS I MAY I HAD NOT BEEN WALKING LONG WHEN I TURNED A CORNER AND MET HER I TINGLE AGAIN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AS MY RECOLLECTION TURNS THAT CORNER AND MY PEN SHAKES IN MY HAND YOUAREOUT EARLY MISS SPENLOW SAID I ITS SO STUPID AT HOME SHE REPLIED AND MISS MURDSTONE IS SO ABSURD SHE TALKS SUCH NONSENSE ABOUT ITS BEING NECESSARY FOR THE DAY TO BE AIRED BEFORE I COME OUT AIRED SHE LAUGHED HERE IN THE MOST MELODIOUS MANNER ON A SUNDAY MORNING WHEN I DONT PRACTISE I MUST DO SOMETHING SO I TOLD PAPA LAST NIGHT I MUST COME OUT BESIDES ITS THE BRIGHTEST TIME OF THE WHOLE DAY DONT YOU THINK SO I HAZARDED A BOLD FLIGHT AND SAID NOT WITHOUT STAMMERING THAT IT WAS VERY BRIGHT TO ME THEN THOUGH IT HAD BEEN VERY DARK TO ME A MINUTE BEFORE DO YOU MEAN A COMPLIMENT SAID DORA OR THAT THE WEATHER HAS REALLY CHANGED I STAMMERED WORSE THAN BEFORE IN REPLYING THAT I MEANT NO COMPLIMENT BUT THE PLAIN TRUTH THOUGH I WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY CHANGE HAVING TAKEN PLACE IN THE WEATHER IT WAS IN THE STATE OF MY OWN FEELINGS I ADDED BASHFULLY TO CLENCH THE EXPLANATION I NEVER SAW SUCH CURLSHOW COULD I FOR THERE NEVER WERE SUCH CURLSAS THOSE SHE SHOOK OUT TO HIDE HER BLUSHES AS TO THE STRAW HAT AND BLUE RIBBONS WHICH WAS ON THE TOP OF THE CURLS IF I COULD ONLY HAVE HUNG IT UP IN MY ROOM IN BUCKINGHAM STREET WHAT A PRICELESS POSSESSION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU HAVE JUST COME HOME FROM PARIS SAID I YES SAID SHE HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE NO OH I HOPE YOULL GO SOON YOU WOULD LIKE IT SO MUCH TRACES OF DEEPSEATED ANGUISH APPEARED IN MY COUNTENANCE THAT SHE SHOULD HOPE I WOULD GO THAT SHE SHOULD THINK IT POSSIBLE I COULD GO WAS INSUPPORTABLE I DEPRECIATED PARIS I DEPRECIATED FRANCE I SAID I WOULDNT LEAVE ENGLAND UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ANY EARTHLY CONSIDERATION NOTHING SHOULD INDUCE ME IN SHORT SHE WAS SHAKING THE CURLS AGAIN WHEN THE LITTLE DOG CAME RUNNING ALONG THE WALK TO OUR RELIEF HE WAS MORTALLY JEALOUS OF ME AND PERSISTED IN BARKING AT ME SHE TOOK HIM UP IN HER ARMSOH MY GOODNESSAND CARESSED HIM BUT HE PERSISTED UPON BARKING STILL HE WOULDNT LET ME TOUCH HIM WHEN I TRIED AND THEN SHE BEAT HIM IT INCREASED MY SUFFERINGS GREATLY TO SEE THE PATS SHE GAVE HIM FOR PUNISHMENT ON THE BRIDGE OF HIS BLUNT NOSE WHILE HE WINKED HIS EYES AND LICKED HER HAND AND STILL GROWLED WITHIN HIMSELF LIKE A LITTLE DOUBLEBASS AT LENGTH HE WAS QUIETWELL HE MIGHT BE WITH HER DIMPLED CHIN UPON HIS HEADAND WE WALKED AWAY TO LOOK AT A GREENHOUSE YOU ARE NOT VERY INTIMATE WITH MISS MURDSTONE ARE YOU SAID DORA MY PET THE TWO LAST WORDS WERE TO THE DOG OH IF THEY HAD ONLY BEEN TO ME NO I REPLIED NOT AT ALL SO SHE IS A TIRESOME CREATURE SAID DORA POUTING I CANT THINK WHAT PAPA CAN HAVE BEEN ABOUT WHEN HE CHOSE SUCH A VEXATIOUS THING TO BE MY COMPANION WHO WANTS A PROTECTOR I AM SURE I DONT WANT A PROTECTOR JIP CAN PROTECT ME A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN MISS MURDSTONECANT YOU JIP DEAR HE ONLY WINKED LAZILY WHEN SHE KISSED HIS BALL OF A HEAD PAPA CALLS HER MY CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND BUT I AM SURE SHE IS NO SUCH THINGIS SHE JIP WE ARE NOT GOING TO CONFIDE IN ANY SUCH CROSS PEOPLE JIP AND I WE MEAN TO BESTOW OUR CONFIDENCE WHERE WE LIKE AND TO FIND OUT OUR OWN FRIENDS INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM FOUND OUT FOR USDONT WE JIP JIP MADE A COMFORTABLE NOISE IN ANSWER A LITTLE LIKE A TEAKETTLE WHEN IT SINGS AS FOR ME EVERY WORD WAS A NEW HEAP OF FETTERS RIVETED ABOVE THE LAST IT IS VERY HARD BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT A KIND MAMA THAT WE ARE TO HAVE INSTEAD A SULKY GLOOMY OLD THING LIKE MISS MURDSTONE ALWAYS FOLLOWING US ABOUTISNT IT JIP NEVER MIND JIP WE WONT BE CONFIDENTIAL AND WELL MAKE OURSELVES AS HAPPY AS WE CAN IN SPITE OF HER AND WELL TEASE HER AND NOT PLEASE HERWONT WE JIP IF IT HAD LASTED ANY LONGER I THINK I MUST HAVE GONE DOWN ON MY KNEES ON THE GRAVEL WITH THE PROBABILITY BEFORE ME OF GRAZING THEM AND OF BEING PRESENTLY EJECTED FROM THE PREMISES BESIDES BUT BY GOOD FORTUNE THE GREENHOUSE WAS NOT FAR OFF AND THESE WORDS BROUGHT US TO IT IT CONTAINED QUITE A SHOW OF BEAUTIFUL GERANIUMS WE LOITERED ALONG IN FRONT OF THEM AND DORA OFTEN STOPPED TO ADMIRE THIS ONE OR THAT ONE AND I STOPPED TO ADMIRE THE SAME ONE AND DORA LAUGHING HELD THE DOG UP CHILDISHLY TO SMELL THE FLOWERS AND IF WE WERE NOT ALL THREE IN FAIRYLAND CERTAINLY I WAS THE SCENT OF A GERANIUM LEAF AT THIS DAY STRIKES ME WITH A HALF COMICAL HALF SERIOUS WONDER AS TO WHAT CHANGE HAS COME OVER ME IN A MOMENT AND THEN I SEE A STRAW HAT AND BLUE RIBBONS AND A QUANTITY OF CURLS AND A LITTLE BLACK DOG BEING HELD UP IN TWO SLENDER ARMS AGAINST A BANK OF BLOSSOMS AND BRIGHT LEAVES MISS MURDSTONE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR US SHE FOUND US HERE AND PRESENTED HER UNCONGENIAL CHEEK THE LITTLE WRINKLES IN IT FILLED WITH HAIR POWDER TO DORA TO BE KISSED THEN SHE TOOK DORAS ARM IN HERS AND MARCHED US INTO BREAKFAST AS IF IT WERE A SOLDIERS FUNERAL HOW MANY CUPS OF TEA I DRANK BECAUSE DORA MADE IT I DONT KNOW BUT I PERFECTLY REMEMBER THAT I SAT SWILLING TEA UNTIL MY WHOLE NERVOUS SYSTEM IF I HAD HAD ANY IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE GONE BY THE BOARD BY AND BY WE WENT TO CHURCH MISS MURDSTONE WAS BETWEEN DORA AND ME IN THE PEW BUT I HEARD HER SING AND THE CONGREGATION VANISHED A SERMON WAS DELIVEREDABOUT DORA OF COURSEAND I AM AFRAID THAT IS ALL I KNOW OF THE SERVICE WE HAD A QUIET DAY NO COMPANY A WALK A FAMILY DINNER OF FOUR AND AN EVENING OF LOOKING OVER BOOKS AND PICTURES MISS MURDSTONE WITH A HOMILY BEFORE HER AND HER EYE UPON US KEEPING GUARD VIGILANTLY AH LITTLE DID MR SPENLOW IMAGINE WHEN HE SAT OPPOSITE TO ME AFTER DINNER THAT DAY WITH HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF OVER HIS HEAD HOW FERVENTLY I WAS EMBRACING HIM IN MY FANCY AS HIS SONINLAW LITTLE DID HE THINK WHEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AT NIGHT THAT HE HAD JUST GIVEN HIS FULL CONSENT TO MY BEING ENGAGED TO DORA AND THAT I WAS INVOKING BLESSINGS ON HIS HEAD WE DEPARTED EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR WE HAD A SALVAGE CASE COMING ON IN THE ADMIRALTY COURT REQUIRING A RATHER ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHOLE SCIENCE OF NAVIGATION IN WHICH AS WE COULDNT BE EXPECTED TO KNOW MUCH ABOUT THOSE MATTERS IN THE COMMONS THE JUDGE HAD ENTREATED TWO OLD TRINITY MASTERS FOR CHARITYS SAKE TO COME AND HELP HIM OUT DORA WAS AT THE BREAKFASTTABLE TO MAKE THE TEA AGAIN HOWEVER AND I HAD THE MELANCHOLY PLEASURE OF TAKING OFF MY HAT TO HER IN THE PHAETON AS SHE STOOD ON THE DOORSTEP WITH JIP IN HER ARMS WHAT THE ADMIRALTY WAS TO ME THAT DAY WHAT NONSENSE I MADE OF OUR CASE IN MY MIND AS I LISTENED TO IT HOW I SAW DORA ENGRAVED UPON THE BLADE OF THE SILVER OAR WHICH THEY LAY UPON THE TABLE AS THE EMBLEM OF THAT HIGH JURISDICTION AND HOW I FELT WHEN MR SPENLOW WENT HOME WITHOUT ME I HAD HAD AN INSANE HOPE THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ME BACK AGAIN AS IF I WERE A MARINER MYSELF AND THE SHIP TO WHICH I BELONGED HAD SAILED AWAY AND LEFT ME ON A DESERT ISLAND I SHALL MAKE NO FRUITLESS EFFORT TO DESCRIBE IF THAT SLEEPY OLD COURT COULD ROUSE ITSELF AND PRESENT IN ANY VISIBLE FORM THE DAYDREAMS I HAVE HAD IN IT ABOUT DORA IT WOULD REVEAL MY TRUTH I DONT MEAN THE DREAMS THAT I DREAMED ON THAT DAY ALONE BUT DAY AFTER DAY FROM WEEK TO WEEK AND TERM TO TERM I WENT THERE NOT TO ATTEND TO WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT TO THINK ABOUT DORA IF EVER I BESTOWED A THOUGHT UPON THE CASES AS THEY DRAGGED THEIR SLOW LENGTH BEFORE ME IT WAS ONLY TO WONDER IN THE MATRIMONIAL CASES REMEMBERING DORA HOW IT WAS THAT MARRIED PEOPLE COULD EVER BE OTHERWISE THAN HAPPY AND IN THE PREROGATIVE CASES TO CONSIDER IF THE MONEY IN QUESTION HAD BEEN LEFT TO ME WHAT WERE THE FOREMOST STEPS I SHOULD IMMEDIATELY HAVE TAKEN IN REGARD TO DORA WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF MY PASSION I BOUGHT FOUR SUMPTUOUS WAISTCOATSNOT FOR MYSELF I HAD NO PRIDE IN THEM FOR DORAAND TOOK TO WEARING STRAWCOLOURED KID GLOVES IN THE STREETS AND LAID THE FOUNDATIONS OF ALL THE CORNS I HAVE EVER HAD IF THE BOOTS I WORE AT THAT PERIOD COULD ONLY BE PRODUCED AND COMPARED WITH THE NATURAL SIZE OF MY FEET THEY WOULD SHOW WHAT THE STATE OF MY HEART WAS IN A MOST AFFECTING MANNER AND YET WRETCHED CRIPPLE AS I MADE MYSELF BY THIS ACT OF HOMAGE TO DORA I WALKED MILES UPON MILES DAILY IN THE HOPE OF SEEING HER NOT ONLY WAS I SOON AS WELL KNOWN ON THE NORWOOD ROAD AS THE POSTMEN ON THAT BEAT BUT I PERVADED LONDON LIKEWISE I WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS WHERE THE BEST SHOPS FOR LADIES WERE I HAUNTED THE BAZAAR LIKE AN UNQUIET SPIRIT I FAGGED THROUGH THE PARK AGAIN AND AGAIN LONG AFTER I WAS QUITE KNOCKED UP SOMETIMES AT LONG INTERVALS AND ON RARE OCCASIONS I SAW HER PERHAPS I SAW HER GLOVE WAVED IN A CARRIAGE WINDOW PERHAPS I MET HER WALKED WITH HER AND MISS MURDSTONE A LITTLE WAY AND SPOKE TO HER IN THE LATTER CASE I WAS ALWAYS VERY MISERABLE AFTERWARDS TO THINK THAT I HAD SAID NOTHING TO THE PURPOSE OR THAT SHE HAD NO IDEA OF THE EXTENT OF MY DEVOTION OR THAT SHE CARED NOTHING ABOUT ME I WAS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT AS MAY BE SUPPOSED FOR ANOTHER INVITATION TO MR SPENLOWS HOUSE I WAS ALWAYS BEING DISAPPOINTED FOR I GOT NONE MRS CRUPP MUST HAVE BEEN A WOMAN OF PENETRATION FOR WHEN THIS ATTACHMENT WAS BUT A FEW WEEKS OLD AND I HAD NOT HAD THE

THAT EARLY STAGE SHE FOUND IT OUT SHE CAME UP TO ME ONE EVENING WHEN I WAS VERY LOW TO ASK SHE BEING THEN AFFLICTED WITH THE DISORDER I HAVE MENTIONED IF I COULD OBLIGE HER WITH A LITTLE TINCTURE OF CARDAMUMS MIXED WITH RHUBARB AND FLAVOURED WITH SEVEN DROPS OF THE ESSENCE OF CLOVES WHICH WAS THE BEST REMEDY FOR HER COMPLAINTOR IF I HAD NOT SUCH A THING BY ME WITH A LITTLE BRANDY WHICH WAS THE NEXT BEST IT WAS NOT SHE REMARKED SO PALATABLE TO HER BUT IT WAS THE NEXT BEST AS I HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THE FIRST REMEDY AND ALWAYS HAD THE SECOND IN THE CLOSET I GAVE MRS CRUPP A GLASS OF THE

PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND IN THE LIGHT OF A SLIGHT LIBERTY ON MRS CRUPPS PART BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WAS CONTENT TO RECEIVE IT IN ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW AS A WORD TO THE WISE AND A WARNING IN FUTURE TO KEEP MY SECRET BETTER CHAPTER TOMMY TRADDLES IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN CONSEQUENCE OF MRS CRUPPS ADVICE AND PERHAPS FOR NO BETTER REASON THAN BECAUSE THERE WAS A CERTAIN SIMILARITY IN THE SOUND OF THE WORD SKITTLES AND TRADDLES THAT IT CAME INTO MY HEAD NEXT DAY TO GO AND LOOK AFTER TRADDLES THE TIME HE HAD MENTIONED WAS MORE THAN OUT AND HE LIVED IN A LITTLE STREET NEAR THE VETERINARY COLLEGE AT CAMDEN TOWN WHICH WAS PRINCIPALLY TENANTED AS ONE OF OUR CLERKS WHO LIVED IN THAT DIRECTION INFORMED ME BY GENTLEMEN STUDENTS WHO BOUGHT LIVE DONKEYS AND MADE EXPERIMENTS ON THOSE QUADRUPEDS IN THEIR PRIVATE APARTMENTS HAVING OBTAINED FROM THIS CLERK A DIRECTION TO THE ACADEMIC GROVE IN QUESTION I SET OUT THE SAME AFTERNOON TO VISIT MY OLD SCHOOLFELLOW I FOUND THAT THE STREET WAS NOT AS DESIRABLE A ONE AS I COULD HAVE WISHED IT TO BE FOR THE SAKE OF TRADDLES THE INHABITANTS APPEARED TO HAVE A PROPENSITY TO THROW ANY LITTLE TRIFLES THEY WERE NOT IN WANT OF INTO THE ROAD WHICH NOT ONLY MADE IT RANK AND SLOPPY BUT UNTIDY TOO ON ACCOUNT OF THE CABBAGELEAVES THE REFUSE WAS NOT WHOLLY VEGETABLE EITHER FOR I MYSELF SAW A SHOE A DOUBLEDUP SAUCEPAN A BLACK BONNET AND AN UMBRELLA IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DECOMPOSITION AS I WAS LOOKING OUT FOR THE NUMBER I WANTED THE GENERAL AIR OF THE PLACE REMINDED ME FORCIBLY OF THE DAYS WHEN I LIVED WITH MR AND MRS MICAWBER AN INDESCRIBABLE CHARACTER OF FADED GENTILITY THAT ATTACHED TO THE HOUSE I SOUGHT AND MADE IT UNLIKE ALL THE OTHER HOUSES IN THE STREETTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL BUILT ON ONE MONOTONOUS PATTERN AND LOOKED LIKE THE EARLY COPIES OF A BLUNDERING BOY WHO WAS LEARNING TO MAKE HOUSES AND HAD NOT YET GOT OUT OF HIS CRAMPED BRICKANDMORTAR POTHOOKSREMINDED ME STILL MORE OF MR AND MRS MICAWBER HAPPENING TO ARRIVE AT THE DOOR AS IT WAS OPENED TO THE

DOWNSTAIRS WHO ARE VERY AGREEABLE PEOPLE INDEED BOTH MR AND MRS MICAWBER HAVE SEEN A GOOD DEAL OF LIFE AND ARE EXCELLENT COMPANY MY DEAR TRADDLES I QUICKLY EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT TRADDLES LOOKED AT ME AS IF HE WONDERED WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT MR AND MRS MICAWBER I REPEATED WHY I AM INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THEM AN OPPORTUNE DOUBLE KNOCK AT THE DOOR WHICH I KNEW WELL FROM OLD EXPERIENCE IN WINDSOR TERRACE AND WHICH NOBODY BUT MR MICAWBER COULD EVER HAVE KNOCKED AT THAT DOOR RESOLVED ANY DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO THEIR BEING MY OLD FRIENDS I BEGGED TRADDLES TO ASK HIS LANDLORD TO WALK UP TRADDLES ACCORDINGLY DID SO OVER THE BANISTER AND MR MICAWBER NOT A BIT CHANGEDHIS TIGHTS HIS STICK HIS SHIRTCOLLAR AND HIS EYEGLASS ALL THE SAME AS EVERCAME INTO THE ROOM WITH A GENTEEL AND YOUTHFUL AIR I BEG YOUR PARDON MR TRADDLES SAID MR MICAWBER WITH THE OLD ROLL IN HIS VOICE AS HE CHECKED HIMSELF IN HUMMING A SOFT TUNE I WAS NOT AWARE THAT THERE WAS ANY INDIVIDUAL ALIEN TO THIS TENEMENT IN YOUR SANCTUM MR MICAWBER SLIGHTLY BOWED TO ME AND PULLED UP HIS SHIRTCOLLAR HOW DO YOU DO MR MICAWBER SAID I SIR SAID MR MICAWBER YOU ARE EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGING I AM IN STATU QUO AND MRS MICAWBER I PURSUED SIR SAID MR MICAWBER SHE IS ALSO THANK GOD IN STATU QUO AND THE CHILDREN MR MICAWBER SIR SAID MR MICAWBER I REJOICE TO REPLY THAT THEY ARE LIKEWISE IN THE ENJOYMENT OF SALUBRITY ALL THIS TIME MR MICAWBER HAD NOT KNOWN ME IN THE LEAST THOUGH HE HAD STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH ME BUT NOW SEEING ME SMILE HE EXAMINED MY FEATURES WITH MORE ATTENTION FELL BACK CRIED IS IT POSSIBLE HAVE I THE PLEASURE OF AGAIN BEHOLDING COPPERFIELD AND SHOOK ME BY BOTH HANDS WITH THE UTMOST FERVOUR GOOD HEAVEN MR TRADDLES SAID MR MICAWBER TO THINK THAT I SHOULD FIND YOU ACQUAINTED WITH THE FRIEND OF MY YOUTH THE COMPANION OF EARLIER DAYS MY DEAR CALLING OVER THE BANISTERS TO MRS MICAWBER WHILE TRADDLES LOOKED WITH REASON NOT A LITTLE AMAZED AT THIS DESCRIPTION OF ME HERE IS A GENTLEMAN IN MR TRADDLESS APARTMENT WHOM HE WISHES TO HAVE THE PLEASURE OF PRESENTING TO YOU MY LOVE MR MICAWBER IMMEDIATELY REAPPEARED AND SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AGAIN AND HOW IS OUR GOOD FRIEND THE DOCTOR COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER AND ALL THE CIRCLE AT CANTERBURY I HAVE NONE BUT GOOD ACCOUNTS OF THEM SAID I I AM MOST DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT SAID MR MICAWBER IT WAS AT CANTERBURY WHERE WE LAST MET WITHIN THE SHADOW I MAY FIGURATIVELY SAY OF THAT RELIGIOUS EDIFICE IMMORTALIZED BY CHAUCER WHICH WAS ANCIENTLY THE RESORT OF PILGRIMS FROM THE REMOTEST CORNERS OFIN SHORT SAID MR MICAWBER IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE CATHEDRAL I REPLIED THAT IT WAS MR MICAWBER CONTINUED TALKING AS VOLUBLY AS HE COULD BUT NOT I THOUGHT WITHOUT SHOWING BY SOME MARKS OF CONCERN IN HIS COUNTENANCE THAT HE WAS SENSIBLE OF SOUNDS IN THE NEXT ROOM AS OF MRS MICAWBER WASHING HER HANDS AND HURRIEDLY OPENING AND SHUTTING DRAWERS THAT WERE UNEASY IN THEIR ACTION YOU FIND US COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER WITH ONE EYE ON TRADDLES AT PRESENT ESTABLISHED ON WHAT MAY BE DESIGNATED AS A SMALL AND UNASSUMING SCALE BUT YOU ARE AWARE THAT I HAVE IN THE COURSE OF MY CAREER SURMOUNTED DIFFICULTIES AND CONQUERED OBSTACLES YOU ARE NO STRANGER TO THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS OF MY LIFE WHEN IT HAS BEEN REQUISITE THAT I SHOULD PAUSE UNTIL CERTAIN EXPECTED EVENTS SHOULD TURN UP WHEN IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD FALL BACK BEFORE MAKING WHAT I TRUST I SHALL NOT BE ACCUSED OF PRESUMPTION IN TERMINGA SPRING THE PRESENT IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTOUS STAGES IN THE LIFE OF MAN YOU FIND ME FALLEN BACK FOR A SPRING AND I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT A VIGOROUS LEAP WILL SHORTLY BE THE RESULT I WAS EXPRESSING MY SATISFACTION WHEN MRS MICAWBER CAME IN A LITTLE MORE SLATTERNLY THAN SHE USED TO BE OR SO SHE SEEMED NOW TO MY UNACCUSTOMED EYES BUT STILL WITH SOME PREPARATION OF HERSELF FOR COMPANY AND WITH A PAIR OF BROWN GLOVES ON MY DEAR SAID MR MICAWBER LEADING HER TOWARDS ME HERE IS A GENTLEMAN OF THE NAME OF COPPERFIELD WHO WISHES TO RENEW HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOU IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AS IT TURNED OUT TO HAVE LED GENTLY UP TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FOR MRS MICAWBER BEING IN A DELICATE STATE OF HEALTH WAS OVERCOME BY IT AND WAS TAKEN SO UNWELL THAT MR MICAWBER WAS OBLIGED IN GREAT TREPIDATION TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATERBUTT IN THE BACKYARD AND DRAW A BASINFUL TO LAVE HER BROW WITH SHE PRESENTLY REVIVED HOWEVER AND WAS REALLY PLEASED TO SEE ME WE HAD HALFANHOURS TALK ALL TOGETHER AND I ASKED HER ABOUT THE TWINS WHO SHE SAID WERE GROWN GREAT CREATURES AND AFTER MASTER AND MISS MICAWBER WHOM SHE DESCRIBED AS ABSOLUTE GIANTS BUT THEY WERE NOT PRODUCED ON THAT OCCASION MR MICAWBER WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT I SHOULD STAY TO DINNER I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AVERSE TO DO SO BUT THAT I IMAGINED I DETECTED TROUBLE AND CALCULATION RELATIVE TO THE EXTENT OF THE COLD MEAT IN MRS MICAWBERS EYE I THEREFORE PLEADED ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT AND OBSERVING THAT MRS MICAWBERS SPIRITS WERE IMMEDIATELY LIGHTENED I RESISTED ALL PERSUASION TO FOREGO IT BUT I TOLD TRADDLES AND MR AND MRS MICAWBER THAT BEFORE I COULD THINK OF LEAVING THEY MUST APPOINT A DAY WHEN THEY WOULD COME AND DINE WITH ME THE OCCUPATIONS TO WHICH TRADDLES STOOD PLEDGED RENDERED IT NECESSARY TO FIX A SOMEWHAT DISTANT ONE BUT AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE FOR THE PURPOSE THAT SUITED US ALL AND THEN I TOOK MY LEAVE MR MICAWBER UNDER PRETENCE OF SHOWING ME A NEARER WAY THAN THAT BY WHICH I HAD COME ACCOMPANIED ME TO THE CORNER OF THE STREET BEING ANXIOUS HE EXPLAINED TO ME TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO AN OLD FRIEND IN CONFIDENCE MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER I NEED HARDLY TELL YOU THAT TO HAVE BENEATH OUR ROOF UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES A MIND LIKE THAT WHICH GLEAMSIF I MAY BE ALLOWED THE EXPRESSIONWHICH GLEAMSIN YOUR FRIEND TRADDLES IS AN UNSPEAKABLE COMFORT WITH A WASHERWOMAN WHO EXPOSES HARDBAKE FOR SALE IN HER PARLOURWINDOW DWELLING NEXT DOOR AND A BOWSTREET OFFICER RESIDING OVER THE WAY YOU MAY IMAGINE THAT HIS SOCIETY IS A SOURCE OF CONSOLATION TO MYSELF AND TO MRS MICAWBER I AM AT PRESENT MY DEAR COPPERFIELD ENGAGED IN THE SALE OF CORN UPON COMMISSION IT IS NOT AN AVOCATION OF A REMUNERATIVE DESCRIPTIONIN OTHER WORDS IT DOES NOT PAYAND SOME TEMPORARY EMBARRASSMENTS OF A PECUNIARY NATURE HAVE BEEN THE CONSEQUENCE I AM HOWEVER DELIGHTED TO ADD THAT I HAVE NOW AN IMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF SOMETHING TURNING UP I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY IN WHAT DIRECTION WHICH I TRUST WILL ENABLE ME TO PROVIDE PERMANENTLY BOTH FOR MYSELF AND FOR YOUR FRIEND TRADDLES IN WHOM I HAVE AN UNAFFECTED INTEREST YOU MAY PERHAPS BE PREPARED TO HEAR THAT MRS MICAWBER IS IN A STATE OF HEALTH WHICH RENDERS IT NOT WHOLLY IMPROBABLE THAT AN ADDITION MAY BE ULTIMATELY MADE TO THOSE PLEDGES OF AFFECTION WHICHIN SHORT TO THE INFANTINE GROUP MRS MICAWBERS FAMILY HAVE BEEN SO GOOD AS TO EXPRESS THEIR DISSATISFACTION AT THIS STATE OF THINGS I HAVE MERELY TO OBSERVE THAT I AM NOT AWARE THAT IT IS ANY BUSINESS OF THEIRS AND THAT I REPEL THAT EXHIBITION OF FEELING WITH SCORN AND WITH DEFIANCE MR MICAWBER THEN SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AGAIN AND LEFT ME CHAPTER MR MICAWBERS GAUNTLET UNTIL THE DAY ARRIVED ON WHICH I WAS TO ENTERTAIN MY NEWLYFOUND OLD FRIENDS I LIVED PRINCIPALLY ON DORA AND COFFEE IN MY LOVELORN CONDITION MY APPETITE LANGUISHED AND I WAS GLAD OF IT FOR I FELT AS THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACT OF PERFIDY TOWARDS DORA TO HAVE A NATURAL RELISH FOR MY DINNER THE QUANTITY OF WALKING EXERCISE I TOOK WAS NOT IN THIS RESPECT ATTENDED WITH ITS USUAL CONSEQUENCE AS THE DISAPPOINTMENT COUNTERACTED THE FRESH AIR I HAVE MY DOUBTS TOO FOUNDED ON THE ACUTE EXPERIENCE ACQUIRED AT THIS PERIOD OF MY LIFE WHETHER A SOUND ENJOYMENT OF ANIMAL FOOD CAN DEVELOP ITSELF FREELY IN ANY HUMAN SUBJECT WHO IS ALWAYS IN TORMENT FROM TIGHT BOOTS I THINK THE EXTREMITIES REQUIRE TO BE AT PEACE BEFORE THE STOMACH WILL CONDUCT ITSELF WITH VIGOUR ON THE OCCASION OF THIS DOMESTIC LITTLE PARTY I DID NOT REPEAT MY FORMER EXTENSIVE PREPARATIONS I MERELY PROVIDED A PAIR OF SOLES A SMALL LEG OF MUTTON AND A PIGEONPIE MRS CRUPP BROKE OUT INTO REBELLION ON MY FIRST BASHFUL HINT IN REFERENCE TO THE COOKING OF THE FISH AND JOINT AND SAID WITH A DIGNIFIED SENSE OF INJURY NO NO SIR YOU WILL NOT ASK ME SICH A THING FOR YOU ARE BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH ME THAN TO SUPPOSE ME CAPABLE OF DOING WHAT I CANNOT DO WITH AMPIAL SATISFACTION TO MY OWN FEELINGS BUT IN THE END A COMPROMISE WAS EFFECTED AND MRS CRUPP CONSENTED TO ACHIEVE THIS FEAT ON CONDITION THAT I DINED FROM HOME FOR A FORTNIGHT AFTERWARDS AND HERE I MAY REMARK THAT WHAT I UNDERWENT FROM MRS CRUPP IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE TYRANNY SHE ESTABLISHED OVER ME WAS DREADFUL I NEVER WAS SO MUCH AFRAID OF ANYONE WE MADE A COMPROMISE OF EVERYTHING IF I HESITATED SHE WAS TAKEN WITH THAT WONDERFUL DISORDER WHICH WAS ALWAYS LYING IN AMBUSH IN HER SYSTEM READY AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE TO PREY UPON HER VITALS IF I RANG THE BELL IMPATIENTLY AFTER HALFADOZEN UNAVAILING MODEST PULLS AND SHE APPEARED AT LASTWHICH WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS TO BE RELIED UPONSHE WOULD APPEAR WITH A REPROACHFUL ASPECT SINK BREATHLESS ON A CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR LAY HER HAND UPON HER NANKEEN BOSOM AND BECOME SO ILL THAT I WAS GLAD AT ANY SACRIFICE OF BRANDY OR ANYTHING ELSE TO GET RID OF HER IF I OBJECTED TO HAVING MY BED MADE AT FIVE OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOONWHICH I DO STILL THINK AN UNCOMFORTABLE ARRANGEMENTONE MOTION OF HER HAND TOWARDS THE SAME NANKEEN REGION OF WOUNDED SENSIBILITY WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME FALTER AN APOLOGY IN SHORT I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING IN AN HONOURABLE WAY RATHER THAN GIVE MRS CRUPP OFFENCE AND SHE WAS THE TERROR OF MY LIFE I BOUGHT A SECONDHAND DUMBWAITER FOR THIS DINNERPARTY IN PREFERENCE TO REENGAGING THE HANDY YOUNG MAN AGAINST WHOM I HAD CONCEIVED A PREJUDICE IN CONSEQUENCE OF MEETING HIM IN THE STRAND ONE SUNDAY MORNING IN A WAISTCOAT REMARKABLY LIKE ONE OF MINE WHICH HAD BEEN MISSING SINCE THE FORMER OCCASION THE YOUNG GAL WAS REENGAGED BUT ON THE STIPULATION THAT SHE SHOULD ONLY BRING IN THE DISHES AND THEN WITHDRAW TO THE LANDINGPLACE BEYOND THE OUTER DOOR WHERE A HABIT OF SNIFFING SHE HAD CONTRACTED WOULD BE LOST UPON THE GUESTS AND WHERE HER RETIRING ON THE PLATES WOULD BE A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY HAVING LAID IN THE MATERIALS FOR A BOWL OF PUNCH TO BE COMPOUNDED BY MR MICAWBER HAVING PROVIDED A BOTTLE OF LAVENDERWATER TWO WAXCANDLES A PAPER OF MIXED PINS AND A PINCUSHION TO ASSIST MRS MICAWBER IN HER TOILETTE AT MY DRESSINGTABLE HAVING ALSO CAUSED THE FIRE IN MY BEDROOM TO BE LIGHTED FOR MRS MICAWBERS CONVENIENCE AND HAVING LAID THE CLOTH WITH MY OWN HANDS I AWAITED THE RESULT WITH COMPOSURE AT THE APPOINTED TIME MY THREE VISITORS ARRIVED TOGETHER MR MICAWBER WITH MORE SHIRTCOLLAR THAN USUAL AND A NEW RIBBON TO HIS EYEGLASS MRS MICAWBER WITH HER CAP IN A WHITEYBROWN PAPER PARCEL TRADDLES CARRYING THE PARCEL AND SUPPORTING MRS MICAWBER ON HIS ARM THEY WERE ALL DELIGHTED WITH MY RESIDENCE WHEN I CONDUCTED MRS MICAWBER TO MY DRESSINGTABLE AND SHE SAW THE SCALE ON WHICH IT WAS PREPARED FOR HER SHE WAS IN SUCH RAPTURES THAT SHE CALLED MR MICAWBER TO COME IN AND LOOK MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER THIS IS LUXURIOUS THIS IS A WAY OF LIFE WHICH REMINDS ME OF THE PERIOD WHEN I WAS MYSELF IN A STATE OF CELIBACY AND MRS MICAWBER HAD NOT YET BEEN SOLICITED TO PLIGHT HER FAITH AT THE HYMENEAL ALTAR HE MEANS SOLICITED BY HIM MR COPPERFIELD SAID MRS MICAWBER ARCHLY HE CANNOT ANSWER FOR OTHERS MY DEAR RETURNED MR MICAWBER WITH SUDDEN SERIOUSNESS I HAVE NO DESIRE TO ANSWER FOR OTHERS I AM TOO WELL AWARE THAT WHEN IN THE INSCRUTABLE DECREES OF FATE YOU WERE RESERVED FOR ME IT IS POSSIBLE YOU MAY HAVE BEEN RESERVED FOR ONE DESTINED AFTER A PROTRACTED STRUGGLE AT LENGTH TO FALL A VICTIM TO PECUNIARY INVOLVEMENTS OF A COMPLICATED NATURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR ALLUSION MY LOVE I REGRET IT BUT I CAN BEAR IT MICAWBER EXCLAIMED MRS MICAWBER IN TEARS HAVE I DESERVED THIS I WHO NEVER HAVE DESERTED YOU WHO NEVER WILL DESERT YOU MICAWBER MY LOVE SAID MR MICAWBER MUCH AFFECTED YOU WILL FORGIVE AND OUR OLD AND TRIED FRIEND COPPERFIELD WILL I AM SURE FORGIVE THE MOMENTARY LACERATION OF A WOUNDED SPIRIT MADE SENSITIVE BY A RECENT COLLISION WITH THE MINION OF POWERIN OTHER WORDS WITH A RIBALD TURNCOCK ATTACHED TO THE WATERWORKSAND WILL PITY NOT CONDEMN ITS EXCESSES MR MICAWBER THEN EMBRACED MRS MICAWBER AND PRESSED MY HAND LEAVING ME TO INFER FROM THIS BROKEN ALLUSION THAT HIS DOMESTIC SUPPLY OF WATER HAD BEEN CUT OFF THAT AFTERNOON IN CONSEQUENCE OF DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF THE COMPANYS RATES TO DIVERT HIS THOUGHTS FROM THIS MELANCHOLY SUBJECT I INFORMED MR MICAWBER THAT I RELIED UPON HIM FOR A BOWL OF PUNCH AND LED HIM TO THE LEMONS HIS RECENT DESPONDENCY NOT TO SAY DESPAIR WAS GONE IN A MOMENT I NEVER SAW A MAN SO THOROUGHLY ENJOY HIMSELF AMID THE FRAGRANCE OF LEMONPEEL AND SUGAR THE ODOUR OF BURNING RUM AND THE STEAM OF BOILING WATER AS MR MICAWBER DID THAT AFTERNOON IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE HIS FACE SHINING AT US OUT OF A THIN CLOUD OF THESE DELICATE FUMES AS HE STIRRED AND MIXED AND TASTED AND LOOKED AS IF HE WERE MAKING INSTEAD OF PUNCH A FORTUNE FOR HIS FAMILY DOWN TO THE LATEST POSTERITY AS TO MRS MICAWBER I DONT KNOW WHETHER IT WAS THE EFFECT OF THE CAP OR THE LAVENDERWATER OR THE PINS OR THE FIRE OR THE WAXCANDLES BUT SHE CAME OUT OF MY ROOM COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING LOVELY AND THE LARK WAS NEVER GAYER THAN THAT EXCELLENT WOMAN I SUPPOSEI NEVER VENTURED TO INQUIRE BUT I SUPPOSETHAT MRS CRUPP AFTER FRYING THE SOLES WAS TAKEN ILL BECAUSE WE BROKE DOWN AT THAT POINT THE LEG OF MUTTON CAME UP VERY RED WITHIN AND VERY PALE WITHOUT BESIDES HAVING A FOREIGN SUBSTANCE OF A GRITTY NATURE SPRINKLED OVER IT AS IF IF HAD HAD A FALL INTO THE ASHES OF THAT REMARKABLE KITCHEN FIREPLACE BUT WE WERE NOT IN CONDITION TO JUDGE OF THIS FACT FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE GRAVY FORASMUCH AS THE YOUNG GAL HAD DROPPED IT ALL UPON THE STAIRSWHERE IT REMAINED BY THE BY IN A LONG TRAIN UNTIL IT WAS WORN OUT THE PIGEONPIE WAS NOT BAD BUT IT WAS A DELUSIVE PIE THE CRUST BEING LIKE A DISAPPOINTING HEAD PHRENOLOGICALLY SPEAKING FULL OF LUMPS AND BUMPS WITH NOTHING PARTICULAR UNDERNEATH IN SHORT THE BANQUET WAS SUCH A FAILURE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE UNHAPPYABOUT THE FAILURE I MEAN FOR I WAS ALWAYS UNHAPPY ABOUT DORAIF I HAD NOT BEEN RELIEVED BY THE GREAT GOOD HUMOUR OF MY COMPANY AND BY A BRIGHT SUGGESTION FROM MR MICAWBER MY DEAR FRIEND COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER ACCIDENTS WILL OCCUR IN THE BESTREGULATED FAMILIES AND IN FAMILIES NOT REGULATED BY THAT PERVADING INFLUENCE WHICH SANCTIFIES WHILE IT ENHANCES THEAI WOULD SAY IN SHORT BY THE INFLUENCE OF WOMAN IN THE LOFTY CHARACTER OF WIFE THEY MAY BE EXPECTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND MUST BE BORNE WITH PHILOSOPHY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO TAKE THE LIBERTY OF REMARKING THAT THERE ARE FEW COMESTIBLES BETTER IN THEIR WAY THAN A DEVIL AND THAT I BELIEVE WITH A LITTLE DIVISION OF LABOUR WE COULD ACCOMPLISH A GOOD ONE IF THE YOUNG PERSON IN ATTENDANCE COULD PRODUCE A GRIDIRON I WOULD PUT IT TO YOU THAT THIS LITTLE MISFORTUNE MAY BE EASILY REPAIRED THERE WAS A GRIDIRON IN THE PANTRY ON WHICH MY MORNING RASHER OF BACON WAS COOKED WE HAD IT IN IN A TWINKLING AND IMMEDIATELY APPLIED OURSELVES TO CARRYING MR MICAWBERS IDEA INTO EFFECT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR TO WHICH HE HAD REFERRED WAS THISTRADDLES CUT THE MUTTON INTO SLICES MR MICAWBER WHO COULD DO ANYTHING OF THIS SORT TO PERFECTION COVERED THEM WITH PEPPER MUSTARD SALT AND CAYENNE I PUT THEM ON THE GRIDIRON TURNED THEM WITH A FORK AND TOOK THEM OFF UNDER MR MICAWBERS DIRECTION AND MRS MICAWBER HEATED AND CONTINUALLY STIRRED SOME MUSHROOM KETCHUP IN A LITTLE SAUCEPAN WHEN WE HAD SLICES ENOUGH DONE TO BEGIN UPON WE FELLTO WITH OUR SLEEVES STILL TUCKED UP AT THE WRIST MORE SLICES SPUTTERING AND BLAZING ON THE FIRE AND OUR ATTENTION DIVIDED BETWEEN THE MUTTON ON OUR PLATES AND THE MUTTON THEN PREPARING WHAT WITH THE NOVELTY OF THIS COOKERY THE EXCELLENCE OF IT THE BUSTLE OF IT THE FREQUENT STARTING UP TO LOOK AFTER IT THE FREQUENT SITTING DOWN TO DISPOSE OF IT AS THE CRISP SLICES CAME OFF THE GRIDIRON HOT AND HOT THE BEING SO BUSY SO FLUSHED WITH THE FIRE SO AMUSED AND IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A TEMPTING NOISE AND SAVOUR WE REDUCED THE LEG OF MUTTON TO THE BONE MY OWN APPETITE CAME BACK MIRACULOUSLY I AM ASHAMED TO RECORD IT BUT I REALLY BELIEVE I FORGOT DORA FOR A LITTLE WHILE I AM SATISFIED THAT MR AND MRS MICAWBER COULD NOT HAVE ENJOYED THE FEAST MORE IF THEY HAD SOLD A BED TO PROVIDE IT TRADDLES LAUGHED AS HEARTILY ALMOST THE WHOLE TIME AS HE ATE AND WORKED INDEED WE ALL DID ALL AT ONCE AND I DARE SAY THERE WAS NEVER A GREATER SUCCESS WE WERE AT THE HEIGHT OF OUR ENJOYMENT AND WERE ALL BUSILY ENGAGED IN OUR SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS ENDEAVOURING TO BRING THE LAST BATCH OF SLICES TO A STATE OF PERFECTION THAT SHOULD CROWN THE FEAST WHEN I WAS AWARE OF A STRANGE PRESENCE IN THE ROOM AND MY EYES ENCOUNTERED THOSE OF THE STAID LITTIMER STANDING HAT IN HAND BEFORE ME WHATS THE MATTER I INVOLUNTARILY ASKED I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR I WAS DIRECTED TO COME IN IS MY MASTER NOT HERE SIR NO HAVE YOU NOT SEEN HIM SIR NO DONT YOU COME FROM HIM NOT IMMEDIATELY SO SIR DID HE TELL YOU YOU WOULD FIND HIM HERE NOT EXACTLY SO SIR BUT I SHOULD THINK HE MIGHT BE HERE TOMORROW AS HE HAS NOT BEEN HERE TODAY IS HE COMING UP FROM OXFORD I BEG SIR HE RETURNED RESPECTFULLY THAT YOU WILL BE SEATED AND ALLOW ME TO DO THIS WITH WHICH HE TOOK THE FORK FROM MY UNRESISTING HAND AND BENT OVER THE GRIDIRON AS IF HIS WHOLE ATTENTION WERE CONCENTRATED ON IT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH DISCOMPOSED I DARE SAY BY THE APPEARANCE OF STEERFORTH HIMSELF BUT WE BECAME IN A MOMENT THE MEEKEST OF THE MEEK BEFORE HIS RESPECTABLE SERVINGMAN MR MICAWBER HUMMING A TUNE TO SHOW THAT HE WAS QUITE AT EASE SUBSIDED INTO HIS CHAIR WITH THE HANDLE OF A HASTILY CONCEALED FORK STICKING OUT OF THE BOSOM OF HIS COAT AS IF HE HAD STABBED HIMSELF MRS MICAWBER PUT ON HER BROWN GLOVES AND ASSUMED A GENTEEL LANGUOR TRADDLES RAN HIS GREASY HANDS THROUGH HIS HAIR AND STOOD IT BOLT UPRIGHT AND STARED IN CONFUSION ON THE TABLECLOTH AS FOR ME I WAS A MERE INFANT AT THE HEAD OF MY OWN TABLE AND HARDLY VENTURED TO GLANCE AT THE RESPECTABLE PHENOMENON WHO HAD COME FROM HEAVEN KNOWS WHERE TO PUT MY ESTABLISHMENT TO RIGHTS MEANWHILE HE TOOK THE MUTTON OFF THE GRIDIRON AND GRAVELY HANDED IT ROUND WE ALL TOOK SOME BUT OUR APPRECIATION OF IT WAS GONE AND WE MERELY MADE A SHOW OF EATING IT AS WE SEVERALLY PUSHED AWAY OUR PLATES HE NOISELESSLY REMOVED THEM AND SET ON THE CHEESE HE TOOK THAT OFF TOO WHEN IT WAS DONE WITH CLEARED THE TABLE PILED EVERYTHING ON THE DUMBWAITER GAVE US OUR WINEGLASSES AND OF HIS OWN ACCORD WHEELED THE DUMBWAITER INTO THE PANTRY ALL THIS WAS DONE IN A PERFECT MANNER AND HE NEVER RAISED HIS EYES FROM WHAT HE WAS ABOUT YET HIS VERY ELBOWS WHEN HE HAD HIS BACK TOWARDS ME SEEMED TO TEEM WITH THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FIXED OPINION THAT I WAS EXTREMELY YOUNG CAN I DO ANYTHING MORE SIR I THANKED HIM AND SAID NO BUT WOULD HE TAKE NO DINNER HIMSELF NONE I AM OBLIGED TO YOU SIR IS MR STEERFORTH COMING FROM OXFORD I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR IS MR STEERFORTH COMING FROM OXFORD I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT HE MIGHT BE HERE TOMORROW SIR I RATHER THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY SIR THE MISTAKE IS MINE NO DOUBT SIR IF YOU SHOULD SEE HIM FIRST SAID I IF YOULL EXCUSE ME SIR I DONT THINK I SHALL SEE HIM FIRST IN CASE YOU DO SAID I PRAY SAY THAT I AM SORRY HE WAS NOT HERE TODAY AS AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS WAS HERE INDEED SIR AND HE DIVIDED A BOW BETWEEN ME AND TRADDLES WITH A GLANCE AT THE LATTER HE WAS MOVING SOFTLY TO THE DOOR WHEN IN A FORLORN HOPE OF SAYING SOMETHING NATURALLYWHICH I NEVER COULD TO THIS MANI SAID OH LITTIMER SIR DID YOU REMAIN LONG AT YARMOUTH THAT TIME NOT PARTICULARLY SO SIR YOU SAW THE BOAT COMPLETED YES SIR I REMAINED BEHIND ON PURPOSE TO SEE THE BOAT COMPLETED I KNOW HE RAISED HIS EYES TO MINE RESPECTFULLY MR STEERFORTH HAS NOT SEEN IT YET I SUPPOSE I REALLY CANT SAY SIR I THINKBUT I REALLY CANT SAY SIR I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SIR HE COMPREHENDED EVERYBODY PRESENT IN THE RESPECTFUL BOW WITH WHICH HE FOLLOWED THESE WORDS AND DISAPPEARED MY VISITORS SEEMED TO BREATHE MORE FREELY WHEN HE WAS GONE BUT MY OWN RELIEF WAS VERY GREAT FOR BESIDES THE CONSTRAINT ARISING FROM THAT EXTRAORDINARY SENSE OF BEING AT A DISADVANTAGE WHICH I ALWAYS HAD IN THIS MANS PRESENCE MY CONSCIENCE HAD EMBARRASSED ME WITH WHISPERS THAT I HAD MISTRUSTED HIS MASTER AND I COULD NOT REPRESS A VAGUE UNEASY DREAD THAT HE MIGHT FIND IT OUT HOW WAS IT HAVING SO LITTLE IN REALITY TO CONCEAL THAT I ALWAYS DID FEEL AS IF THIS MAN WERE FINDING ME OUT MR MICAWBER ROUSED ME FROM THIS REFLECTION WHICH WAS BLENDED WITH A CERTAIN REMORSEFUL APPREHENSION OF SEEING STEERFORTH HIMSELF BY BESTOWING MANY ENCOMIUMS ON THE ABSENT LITTIMER AS A MOST RESPECTABLE FELLOW AND A THOROUGHLY ADMIRABLE SERVANT MR MICAWBER I MAY REMARK HAD TAKEN HIS FULL SHARE OF THE GENERAL BOW AND HAD RECEIVED IT WITH INFINITE CONDESCENSION BUT PUNCH MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER TASTING IT LIKE TIME AND TIDE WAITS FOR NO MAN AH IT IS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IN HIGH FLAVOUR MY LOVE WILL YOU GIVE ME YOUR OPINION MRS MICAWBER PRONOUNCED IT EXCELLENT THEN I WILL DRINK SAID MR MICAWBER IF MY FRIEND COPPERFIELD WILL PERMIT ME TO TAKE THAT SOCIAL LIBERTY TO THE DAYS WHEN MY FRIEND COPPERFIELD AND MYSELF WERE YOUNGER AND FOUGHT OUR WAY IN THE WORLD SIDE BY SIDE I MAY SAY OF MYSELF AND COPPERFIELD IN WORDS WE HAVE SUNG TOGETHER BEFORE NOW THAT WE TWA HAE RUN ABOUT THE BRAES AND PUD THE GOWANS FINE IN A FIGURATIVE POINT OF VIEWON SEVERAL OCCASIONS I AM NOT EXACTLY AWARE SAID MR MICAWBER WITH THE OLD ROLL IN HIS VOICE AND THE OLD INDESCRIBABLE AIR OF SAYING SOMETHING GENTEEL WHAT GOWANS MAY BE BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT COPPERFIELD AND MYSELF WOULD FREQUENTLY HAVE TAKEN A PULL AT THEM IF IT HAD BEEN FEASIBLE MR MICAWBER AT THE THEN PRESENT MOMENT TOOK A PULL AT HIS PUNCH SO WE ALL DID TRADDLES EVIDENTLY LOST IN WONDERING AT WHAT DISTANT TIME MR MICAWBER AND I COULD HAVE BEEN COMRADES IN THE BATTLE OF THE WORLD AHEM SAID MR MICAWBER CLEARING HIS THROAT AND WARMING WITH THE PUNCH AND WITH THE FIRE MY DEAR ANOTHER GLASS MRS MICAWBER SAID IT MUST BE VERY LITTLE BUT WE COULDNT ALLOW THAT SO IT WAS A GLASSFUL AS WE ARE QUITE CONFIDENTIAL HERE MR COPPERFIELD SAID MRS MICAWBER SIPPING HER PUNCH MR TRADDLES BEING A PART OF OUR DOMESTICITY I SHOULD MUCH LIKE TO HAVE YOUR OPINION ON MR MICAWBERS PROSPECTS FOR CORN SAID MRS MICAWBER ARGUMENTATIVELY AS I HAVE REPEATEDLY SAID TO MR MICAWBER MAY BE GENTLEMANLY BUT IT IS NOT REMUNERATIVE COMMISSION TO THE EXTENT OF TWO AND NINEPENCE IN A FORTNIGHT CANNOT HOWEVER LIMITED OUR IDEAS BE CONSIDERED REMUNERATIVE WE WERE ALL AGREED UPON THAT THEN SAID MRS MICAWBER WHO PRIDED HERSELF ON TAKING A CLEAR VIEW OF THINGS AND KEEPING MR MICAWBER STRAIGHT BY HER WOMANS WISDOM WHEN HE MIGHT OTHERWISE GO A LITTLE CROOKED THEN I ASK MYSELF THIS QUESTION IF CORN IS NOT TO BE RELIED UPON WHAT IS ARE COALS TO BE RELIED UPON NOT AT ALL WE HAVE TURNED OUR ATTENTION TO THAT EXPERIMENT ON THE SUGGESTION OF MY FAMILY AND WE FIND IT FALLACIOUS MR MICAWBER LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS EYED US ASIDE AND NODDED HIS HEAD AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT THE CASE WAS VERY CLEARLY PUT THE ARTICLES OF CORN AND COALS SAID MRS MICAWBER STILL MORE ARGUMENTATIVELY BEING EQUALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION MR COPPERFIELD I NATURALLY LOOK ROUND THE WORLD AND SAY WHAT IS THERE IN WHICH A PERSON OF MR MICAWBERS TALENT IS LIKELY TO SUCCEED AND I EXCLUDE THE DOING ANYTHING ON COMMISSION BECAUSE COMMISSION IS NOT A CERTAINTY WHAT IS BEST SUITED TO A PERSON OF MR MICAWBERS PECULIAR TEMPERAMENT IS I AM CONVINCED A CERTAINTY TRADDLES AND I BOTH EXPRESSED BY A FEELING MURMUR THAT THIS GREAT DISCOVERY WAS NO DOUBT TRUE OF MR MICAWBER AND THAT IT DID HIM MUCH CREDIT I WILL NOT CONCEAL FROM YOU MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD SAID MRS MICAWBER THAT I HAVE LONG FELT THE BREWING BUSINESS TO BE PARTICULARLY ADAPTED TO MR MICAWBER LOOK AT BARCLAY AND PERKINS LOOK AT TRUMAN HANBURY AND BUXTON IT IS ON THAT EXTENSIVE FOOTING THAT MR MICAWBER I KNOW FROM MY OWN KNOWLEDGE OF HIM IS CALCULATED TO SHINE AND THE PROFITS I AM TOLD ARE ENORMOUS BUT IF MR MICAWBER CANNOT GET INTO THOSE FIRMSWHICH DECLINE TO ANSWER HIS LETTERS WHEN HE OFFERS HIS SERVICES EVEN IN AN INFERIOR CAPACITYWHAT IS THE USE OF DWELLING UPON THAT IDEA NONE I MAY HAVE A CONVICTION THAT MR MICAWBERS MANNERS HEM REALLY MY DEAR INTERPOSED MR MICAWBER MY LOVE BE SILENT SAID MRS MICAWBER LAYING HER BROWN GLOVE ON HIS HAND I MAY HAVE A CONVICTION MR COPPERFIELD THAT MR MICAWBERS MANNERS PECULIARLY QUALIFY HIM FOR THE BANKING BUSINESS I MAY ARGUE WITHIN MYSELF THAT IF I HAD A DEPOSIT AT A BANKINGHOUSE THE MANNERS OF MR MICAWBER AS REPRESENTING THAT BANKINGHOUSE WOULD INSPIRE CONFIDENCE AND MUST EXTEND THE CONNEXION BUT IF THE VARIOUS BANKINGHOUSES REFUSE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF MR MICAWBERS ABILITIES OR RECEIVE THE OFFER OF THEM WITH CONTUMELY WHAT IS THE USE OF DWELLING UPON THAT IDEA NONE AS TO ORIGINATING A BANKINGBUSINESS I MAY KNOW THAT THERE ARE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY WHO IF THEY CHOSE TO PLACE THEIR MONEY IN MR MICAWBERS HANDS MIGHT FOUND AN ESTABLISHMENT OF THAT DESCRIPTION BUT IF THEY DO NOT CHOOSE TO PLACE THEIR MONEY IN MR MICAWBERS HANDSWHICH THEY DONTWHAT IS THE USE OF THAT AGAIN I CONTEND THAT WE ARE NO FARTHER ADVANCED THAN WE WERE BEFORE I SHOOK MY HEAD AND SAID NOT A BIT TRADDLES ALSO SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID NOT A BIT WHAT DO I DEDUCE FROM THIS MRS MICAWBER WENT ON TO SAY STILL WITH THE SAME AIR OF PUTTING A CASE LUCIDLY WHAT IS THE CONCLUSION MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD TO WHICH I AM IRRESISTIBLY BROUGHT AM I WRONG IN SAYING IT IS CLEAR THAT WE MUST LIVE I ANSWERED NOT AT ALL AND TRADDLES ANSWERED NOT AT ALL AND I FOUND MYSELF AFTERWARDS SAGELY ADDING ALONE THAT A PERSON MUST EITHER LIVE OR DIE JUST SO RETURNED MRS MICAWBER IT IS PRECISELY THAT AND THE FACT IS MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD THAT WE CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT SOMETHING WIDELY DIFFERENT FROM EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES SHORTLY TURNING UP NOW I AM CONVINCED MYSELF AND THIS I HAVE POINTED OUT TO MR MICAWBER SEVERAL TIMES OF LATE THAT THINGS CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO TURN UP OF THEMSELVES WE MUST IN A MEASURE ASSIST TO TURN THEM UP I MAY BE WRONG BUT I HAVE FORMED THAT OPINION BOTH TRADDLES AND I APPLAUDED IT HIGHLY VERY WELL SAID MRS MICAWBER THEN WHAT DO I RECOMMEND HERE IS MR MICAWBER WITH A VARIETY OF QUALIFICATIONSWITH GREAT TALENT REALLY MY LOVE SAID MR MICAWBER PRAY MY DEAR ALLOW ME TO CONCLUDE HERE IS MR MICAWBER WITH A VARIETY OF QUALIFICATIONS WITH GREAT TALENTI SHOULD SAY WITH GENIUS BUT THAT MAY BE THE PARTIALITY OF A WIFE TRADDLES AND I BOTH MURMURED NO AND HERE IS MR MICAWBER WITHOUT ANY SUITABLE POSITION OR EMPLOYMENT WHERE DOES THAT RESPONSIBILITY REST CLEARLY ON SOCIETY THEN I WOULD MAKE A FACT SO DISGRACEFUL KNOWN AND BOLDLY CHALLENGE SOCIETY TO SET IT RIGHT IT APPEARS TO ME MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD SAID MRS MICAWBER FORCIBLY THAT WHAT MR MICAWBER HAS TO DO IS TO THROW DOWN THE GAUNTLET TO SOCIETY AND SAY IN EFFECT SHOW ME WHO WILL TAKE THAT UP LET THE PARTY IMMEDIATELY STEP FORWARD I VENTURED TO ASK MRS MICAWBER HOW THIS WAS TO BE DONE BY ADVERTISING SAID MRS MICAWBERIN ALL THE PAPERS IT APPEARS TO ME THAT WHAT MR MICAWBER HAS TO DO IN JUSTICE TO HIMSELF IN JUSTICE TO HIS FAMILY AND I WILL EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO SAY IN JUSTICE TO SOCIETY BY WHICH HE HAS BEEN HITHERTO OVERLOOKED IS TO ADVERTISE IN ALL THE PAPERS TO DESCRIBE HIMSELF PLAINLY AS SOANDSO WITH SUCH AND SUCH QUALIFICATIONS AND TO PUT IT THUS NOW EMPLOY ME ON REMUNERATIVE TERMS AND ADDRESS POSTPAID TO W M POST OFFICE CAMDEN TOWN THIS IDEA OF MRS MICAWBERS MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER MAKING HIS SHIRTCOLLAR MEET IN FRONT OF HIS CHIN AND GLANCING AT ME SIDEWAYS IS IN FACT THE LEAP TO WHICH I ALLUDED WHEN I LAST HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU ADVERTISING IS RATHER EXPENSIVE I REMARKED DUBIOUSLY EXACTLY SO SAID MRS MICAWBER PRESERVING THE SAME LOGICAL AIR QUITE TRUE MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD I HAVE MADE THE IDENTICAL OBSERVATION TO MR MICAWBER IT IS FOR THAT REASON ESPECIALLY THAT I THINK MR MICAWBER OUGHT AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID IN JUSTICE TO HIMSELF IN JUSTICE TO HIS FAMILY AND IN JUSTICE TO SOCIETY TO RAISE A CERTAIN SUM OF MONEYON A BILL MR MICAWBER LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR TRIFLED WITH HIS EYEGLASS AND CAST HIS EYES UP AT THE CEILING BUT I THOUGHT HIM OBSERVANT OF TRADDLES TOO WHO WAS LOOKING AT THE FIRE IF NO MEMBER OF MY FAMILY SAID MRS MICAWBER IS POSSESSED OF SUFFICIENT NATURAL FEELING TO NEGOTIATE THAT BILLI BELIEVE THERE IS A BETTER BUSINESSTERM TO EXPRESS WHAT I MEAN MR MICAWBER WITH HIS EYES STILL CAST UP AT THE CEILING SUGGESTED DISCOUNT TO DISCOUNT THAT BILL SAID MRS MICAWBER THEN MY OPINION IS THAT MR MICAWBER SHOULD GO INTO THE CITY SHOULD TAKE THAT BILL INTO THE MONEY MARKET AND SHOULD DISPOSE OF IT FOR WHAT HE CAN GET IF THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE MONEY MARKET OBLIGE MR MICAWBER TO SUSTAIN A GREAT SACRIFICE THAT IS BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THEIR CONSCIENCES I VIEW IT STEADILY AS AN INVESTMENT I RECOMMEND MR MICAWBER MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD TO DO THE SAME TO REGARD IT AS AN INVESTMENT WHICH IS SURE OF RETURN AND TO MAKE UP HIS MIND TO ANY SACRIFICE I FELT BUT I AM SURE I DONT KNOW WHY THAT THIS WAS SELFDENYING AND DEVOTED IN MRS MICAWBER AND I UTTERED A MURMUR TO THAT EFFECT TRADDLES WHO TOOK HIS TONE FROM ME DID LIKEWISE STILL LOOKING AT THE FIRE I WILL NOT SAID MRS MICAWBER FINISHING HER PUNCH AND GATHERING HER SCARF ABOUT HER SHOULDERS PREPARATORY TO HER WITHDRAWAL TO MY BEDROOM I WILL NOT PROTRACT THESE REMARKS ON THE SUBJECT OF MR MICAWBERS PECUNIARY AFFAIRS AT YOUR FIRESIDE MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD AND IN THE PRESENCE OF MR TRADDLES WHO THOUGH NOT SO OLD A FRIEND IS QUITE ONE OF OURSELVES I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM MAKING YOU ACQUAINTED WITH THE COURSE I ADVISE MR MICAWBER TO TAKE I FEEL THAT THE TIME IS ARRIVED WHEN MR MICAWBER SHOULD EXERT HIMSELF ANDI WILL ADDASSERT HIMSELF AND IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THESE ARE THE MEANS I AM AWARE THAT I AM MERELY A FEMALE AND THAT A MASCULINE JUDGEMENT IS USUALLY CONSIDERED MORE COMPETENT TO THE DISCUSSION OF SUCH QUESTIONS STILL I MUST NOT FORGET THAT WHEN I LIVED AT HOME WITH MY PAPA AND MAMA MY PAPA WAS IN THE HABIT OF SAYING EMMAS FORM IS FRAGILE BUT HER GRASP OF A SUBJECT IS INFERIOR TO NONE THAT MY PAPA WAS TOO PARTIAL I WELL KNOW BUT THAT HE WAS AN OBSERVER OF CHARACTER IN SOME DEGREE MY DUTY AND MY REASON EQUALLY FORBID ME TO DOUBT WITH THESE WORDS AND RESISTING OUR ENTREATIES THAT SHE WOULD GRACE THE REMAINING CIRCULATION OF THE PUNCH WITH HER PRESENCE MRS MICAWBER RETIRED TO MY BEDROOM AND REALLY I FELT THAT SHE WAS A NOBLE WOMANTHE SORT OF WOMAN WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN A ROMAN MATRON AND DONE ALL MANNER OF HEROIC THINGS IN TIMES OF PUBLIC TROUBLE IN THE FERVOUR OF THIS IMPRESSION I CONGRATULATED MR MICAWBER ON THE TREASURE HE POSSESSED SO DID TRADDLES MR MICAWBER EXTENDED HIS HAND TO EACH OF US IN SUCCESSION AND THEN COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF WHICH I THINK HAD MORE SNUFF UPON IT THAN HE WAS AWARE OF HE THEN RETURNED TO THE PUNCH IN THE HIGHEST STATE OF EXHILARATION HE WAS FULL OF ELOQUENCE HE GAVE US TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN OUR CHILDREN WE LIVED AGAIN AND THAT UNDER THE PRESSURE OF PECUNIARY DIFFICULTIES ANY ACCESSION TO THEIR NUMBER WAS DOUBLY WELCOME HE SAID THAT MRS MICAWBER HAD LATTERLY HAD HER DOUBTS ON THIS POINT BUT THAT HE HAD DISPELLED THEM AND REASSURED HER AS TO HER FAMILY THEY WERE TOTALLY UNWORTHY OF HER AND THEIR SENTIMENTS WERE UTTERLY INDIFFERENT TO HIM AND THEY MIGHTI QUOTE HIS OWN EXPRESSIONGO TO THE DEVIL MR MICAWBER THEN DELIVERED A WARM EULOGY ON TRADDLES HE SAID TRADDLESS WAS A CHARACTER TO THE STEADY VIRTUES OF WHICH HE MR MICAWBER COULD LAY NO CLAIM BUT WHICH HE THANKED HEAVEN HE COULD ADMIRE HE FEELINGLY ALLUDED TO THE YOUNG LADY UNKNOWN WHOM TRADDLES HAD HONOURED WITH HIS AFFECTION AND WHO HAD RECIPROCATED THAT AFFECTION BY HONOURING AND BLESSING TRADDLES WITH HER AFFECTION MR MICAWBER PLEDGED HER SO DID I TRADDLES THANKED US BOTH BY SAYING WITH A SIMPLICITY AND HONESTY I HAD SENSE ENOUGH TO BE QUITE CHARMED WITH I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU INDEED AND I DO ASSURE YOU SHES THE DEAREST GIRL MR MICAWBER TOOK AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY AFTER THAT OF HINTING WITH THE UTMOST DELICACY AND CEREMONY AT THE STATE OF MY AFFECTIONS NOTHING BUT THE SERIOUS ASSURANCE OF HIS FRIEND COPPERFIELD TO THE CONTRARY HE OBSERVED COULD DEPRIVE HIM OF THE IMPRESSION THAT HIS FRIEND COPPERFIELD LOVED AND WAS BELOVED AFTER FEELING VERY HOT AND UNCOMFORTABLE FOR SOME TIME AND AFTER A GOOD DEAL OF BLUSHING STAMMERING AND DENYING I SAID HAVING MY GLASS IN MY HAND WELL I WOULD GIVE THEM D WHICH SO EXCITED AND GRATIFIED MR MICAWBER THAT HE RAN WITH A GLASS OF PUNCH INTO MY BEDROOM IN ORDER THAT MRS MICAWBER MIGHT DRINK D WHO DRANK IT WITH ENTHUSIASM CRYING FROM WITHIN IN A SHRILL VOICE HEAR HEAR MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD I AM DELIGHTED HEAR AND TAPPING AT THE WALL BY WAY OF APPLAUSE OUR CONVERSATION AFTERWARDS TOOK A MORE WORLDLY TURN MR MICAWBER TELLING US THAT HE FOUND CAMDEN TOWN INCONVENIENT AND THAT THE FIRST THING HE CONTEMPLATED DOING WHEN THE ADVERTISEMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF SOMETHING SATISFACTORY TURNING UP WAS TO MOVE HE MENTIONED A TERRACE AT THE WESTERN END OF OXFORD STREET FRONTING HYDE PARK ON WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS HAD HIS EYE BUT WHICH HE DID NOT EXPECT TO ATTAIN IMMEDIATELY AS IT WOULD REQUIRE A LARGE ESTABLISHMENT THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE AN INTERVAL HE EXPLAINED IN WHICH HE SHOULD CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE UPPER PART OF A HOUSE OVER SOME RESPECTABLE PLACE OF BUSINESSSAY IN PICCADILLYWHICH WOULD BE A CHEERFUL SITUATION FOR MRS MICAWBER AND WHERE BY THROWING OUT A BOWWINDOW OR CARRYING UP THE ROOF ANOTHER STORY OR MAKING SOME LITTLE ALTERATION OF THAT SORT THEY MIGHT LIVE COMFORTABLY AND REPUTABLY FOR A FEW YEARS WHATEVER WAS RESERVED FOR HIM HE EXPRESSLY SAID OR WHEREVER HIS ABODE MIGHT BE WE MIGHT RELY ON THISTHERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A ROOM FOR TRADDLES AND A KNIFE AND FORK FOR ME WE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS KINDNESS AND HE BEGGED US TO FORGIVE HIS HAVING LAUNCHED INTO THESE PRACTICAL AND BUSINESSLIKE DETAILS AND TO EXCUSE IT AS NATURAL IN ONE WHO WAS MAKING ENTIRELY NEW ARRANGEMENTS IN LIFE MRS MICAWBER TAPPING AT THE WALL AGAIN TO KNOW IF TEA WERE READY BROKE UP THIS PARTICULAR PHASE OF OUR FRIENDLY CONVERSATION SHE MADE TEA FOR US IN A MOST AGREEABLE MANNER AND WHENEVER I WENT NEAR HER IN HANDING ABOUT THE TEACUPS AND BREADANDBUTTER ASKED ME IN A WHISPER WHETHER D WAS FAIR OR DARK OR WHETHER SHE WAS SHORT OR TALL OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND WHICH I THINK I LIKED AFTER TEA WE DISCUSSED A VARIETY OF TOPICS BEFORE THE FIRE AND MRS MICAWBER WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO SING US IN A SMALL THIN FLAT VOICE WHICH I REMEMBERED TO HAVE CONSIDERED WHEN I FIRST KNEW HER THE VERY TABLEBEER OF ACOUSTICS THE FAVOURITE BALLADS OF THE DASHING WHITE SERGEANT AND LITTLE TAFFLIN FOR BOTH OF THESE SONGS MRS MICAWBER HAD BEEN FAMOUS WHEN SHE LIVED AT HOME WITH HER PAPA AND MAMA MR MICAWBER TOLD US THAT WHEN HE HEARD HER SING THE FIRST ONE ON THE FIRST OCCASION OF HIS SEEING HER BENEATH THE PARENTAL ROOF SHE HAD ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION IN AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE BUT THAT WHEN IT CAME TO LITTLE TAFFLIN HE HAD RESOLVED TO WIN THAT WOMAN OR PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT IT WAS BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN OCLOCK WHEN MRS MICAWBER ROSE TO REPLACE HER CAP IN THE WHITEYBROWN PAPER PARCEL AND TO PUT ON HER BONNET MR MICAWBER TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRADDLES PUTTING ON HIS GREATCOAT TO SLIP A LETTER INTO MY HAND WITH A WHISPERED REQUEST THAT I WOULD READ IT AT MY LEISURE I ALSO TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF MY HOLDING A CANDLE OVER THE BANISTERS TO LIGHT THEM DOWN WHEN MR MICAWBER WAS GOING FIRST LEADING MRS MICAWBER AND TRADDLES WAS FOLLOWING WITH THE CAP TO DETAIN TRADDLES FOR A MOMENT ON THE TOP OF THE STAIRS TRADDLES SAID I MR MICAWBER DONT MEAN ANY HARM POOR FELLOW BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULDNT LEND HIM ANYTHING MY DEAR COPPERFIELD RETURNED TRADDLES SMILING I HAVENT GOT ANYTHING TO LEND YOU HAVE GOT A NAME YOU KNOW SAID I OH YOU CALL THAT SOMETHING TO LEND RETURNED TRADDLES WITH A THOUGHTFUL LOOK CERTAINLY OH SAID TRADDLES YES TO BE SURE I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU COPPERFIELD BUTI AM AFRAID I HAVE LENT HIM THAT ALREADY FOR THE BILL THAT IS TO BE A CERTAIN INVESTMENT I INQUIRED NO SAID TRADDLES NOT FOR THAT ONE THIS IS THE FIRST I HAVE HEARD OF THAT ONE I HAVE BEEN THINKING THAT HE WILL MOST LIKELY PROPOSE THAT ONE ON THE WAY HOME MINES ANOTHER I HOPE THERE WILL BE NOTHING WRONG ABOUT IT SAID I I HOPE NOT SAID TRADDLES I SHOULD THINK NOT THOUGH BECAUSE HE TOLD ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY THAT IT WAS PROVIDED FOR THAT WAS MR MICAWBERS EXPRESSION PROVIDED FOR MR MICAWBER LOOKING UP AT THIS JUNCTURE TO WHERE WE WERE STANDING I HAD ONLY TIME TO REPEAT MY CAUTION TRADDLES THANKED ME AND DESCENDED BUT I WAS MUCH AFRAID WHEN I OBSERVED THE GOODNATURED MANNER IN WHICH HE WENT DOWN WITH THE CAP IN HIS HAND AND GAVE MRS MICAWBER HIS ARM THAT HE WOULD BE CARRIED INTO THE MONEY MARKET NECK AND HEELS I RETURNED TO MY FIRESIDE AND WAS MUSING HALF GRAVELY AND HALF LAUGHING ON THE CHARACTER OF MR MICAWBER AND THE OLD RELATIONS BETWEEN US WHEN I HEARD A QUICK STEP ASCENDING THE STAIRS AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS TRADDLES COMING BACK FOR SOMETHING MRS MICAWBER HAD LEFT BEHIND BUT AS THE STEP APPROACHED I KNEW IT AND FELT MY HEART BEAT HIGH AND THE BLOOD RUSH TO MY FACE FOR IT WAS STEERFORTHS I WAS NEVER UNMINDFUL OF AGNES AND SHE NEVER LEFT THAT SANCTUARY IN MY THOUGHTSIF I MAY CALL IT SOWHERE I HAD PLACED HER FROM THE FIRST BUT WHEN HE ENTERED AND STOOD BEFORE ME WITH HIS HAND OUT THE DARKNESS THAT HAD FALLEN ON HIM CHANGED TO LIGHT AND I FELT CONFOUNDED AND ASHAMED OF HAVING DOUBTED ONE I LOVED SO HEARTILY I LOVED HER NONE THE LESS I THOUGHT OF HER AS THE SAME BENIGNANT GENTLE ANGEL IN MY LIFE I REPROACHED MYSELF NOT HER WITH HAVING DONE HIM AN INJURY AND I WOULD HAVE MADE HIM ANY ATONEMENT IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT TO MAKE AND HOW TO MAKE IT WHY DAISY OLD BOY DUMBFOUNDERED LAUGHED STEERFORTH SHAKING MY HAND HEARTILY AND THROWING IT GAILY AWAY HAVE I DETECTED YOU IN ANOTHER FEAST YOU SYBARITE THESE DOCTORS COMMONS FELLOWS ARE THE GAYEST MEN IN TOWN I BELIEVE AND BEAT US SOBER OXFORD PEOPLE ALL TO NOTHING HIS BRIGHT GLANCE WENT MERRILY ROUND THE ROOM AS HE TOOK THE SEAT ON THE SOFA OPPOSITE TO ME WHICH MRS MICAWBER HAD RECENTLY VACATED AND STIRRED THE FIRE INTO A BLAZE I WAS SO SURPRISED AT FIRST SAID I GIVING HIM WELCOME WITH ALL THE CORDIALITY I FELT THAT I HAD HARDLY BREATH TO GREET YOU WITH STEERFORTH WELL THE SIGHT OF ME IS GOOD FOR SORE EYES AS THE SCOTCH SAY REPLIED STEERFORTH AND SO IS THE SIGHT OF YOU DAISY IN FULL BLOOM HOW ARE YOU MY BACCHANAL I AM VERY WELL SAID I AND NOT AT ALL BACCHANALIAN TONIGHT THOUGH I CONFESS TO ANOTHER PARTY OF THREE ALL OF WHOM I MET IN THE STREET TALKING LOUD IN YOUR PRAISE RETURNED STEERFORTH WHOS OUR FRIEND IN THE TIGHTS I GAVE HIM THE BEST IDEA I COULD IN A FEW WORDS OF MR MICAWBER HE LAUGHED HEARTILY AT MY FEEBLE PORTRAIT OF THAT GENTLEMAN AND SAID HE WAS A MAN TO KNOW AND HE MUST KNOW HIM BUT WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE OUR OTHER FRIEND IS SAID I IN MY TURN HEAVEN KNOWS SAID STEERFORTH NOT A BORE I HOPE I THOUGHT HE LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE ONE TRADDLES I REPLIED TRIUMPHANTLY WHOS HE ASKED STEERFORTH IN HIS CARELESS WAY DONT YOU REMEMBER TRADDLES TRADDLES IN OUR ROOM AT SALEM HOUSE OH THAT FELLOW SAID STEERFORTH BEATING A LUMP OF COAL ON THE TOP OF THE FIRE WITH THE POKER IS HE AS SOFT AS EVER AND WHERE THE DEUCE DID YOU PICK HIM UP I EXTOLLED TRADDLES IN REPLY AS HIGHLY AS I COULD FOR I FELT THAT STEERFORTH RATHER SLIGHTED HIM STEERFORTH DISMISSING THE SUBJECT WITH A LIGHT NOD AND A SMILE AND THE REMARK THAT HE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE THE OLD FELLOW TOO FOR HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN AN ODD FISH INQUIRED IF I COULD GIVE HIM ANYTHING TO EAT DURING MOST OF THIS SHORT DIALOGUE WHEN HE HAD NOT BEEN SPEAKING IN A WILD VIVACIOUS MANNER HE HAD SAT IDLY BEATING ON THE LUMP OF COAL WITH THE POKER I OBSERVED THAT HE DID THE SAME THING WHILE I WAS GETTING OUT THE REMAINS OF THE PIGEONPIE AND SO FORTH WHY DAISY HERES A SUPPER FOR A KING HE EXCLAIMED STARTING OUT OF HIS SILENCE WITH A BURST AND TAKING HIS SEAT AT THE TABLE I SHALL DO IT JUSTICE FOR I HAVE COME FROM YARMOUTH I THOUGHT YOU CAME FROM OXFORD I RETURNED NOT I SAID STEERFORTH I HAVE BEEN SEAFARINGBETTER EMPLOYED LITTIMER WAS HERE TODAY TO INQUIRE FOR YOU I REMARKED AND I UNDERSTOOD HIM THAT YOU WERE AT OXFORD THOUGH NOW I THINK OF IT HE CERTAINLY DID NOT SAY SO LITTIMER IS A GREATER FOOL THAN I THOUGHT HIM TO HAVE BEEN INQUIRING FOR ME AT ALL SAID STEERFORTH JOVIALLY POURING OUT A GLASS OF WINE AND DRINKING TO ME AS TO UNDERSTANDING HIM YOU ARE A CLEVERER FELLOW THAN MOST OF US DAISY IF YOU CAN DO THAT THATS TRUE INDEED SAID I MOVING MY CHAIR TO THE TABLE SO YOU HAVE BEEN AT YARMOUTH STEERFORTH INTERESTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT HAVE YOU BEEN THERE LONG NO HE RETURNED AN ESCAPADE OF A WEEK OR SO AND HOW ARE THEY ALL OF COURSE LITTLE EMILY IS NOT MARRIED YET NOT YET GOING TO BE I BELIEVEIN SO MANY WEEKS OR MONTHS OR SOMETHING OR OTHER I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF EM BY THE BY HE LAID DOWN HIS KNIFE AND FORK WHICH HE HAD BEEN USING WITH GREAT DILIGENCE AND BEGAN FEELING IN HIS POCKETS I HAVE A LETTER FOR YOU FROM WHOM WHY FROM YOUR OLD NURSE HE RETURNED TAKING SOME PAPERS OUT OF HIS BREAST POCKET J STEERFORTH ESQUIRE DEBTOR TO THE WILLING MIND THATS NOT IT PATIENCE AND WELL FIND IT PRESENTLY OLD WHATSHISNAMES IN A BAD WAY AND ITS ABOUT THAT I BELIEVE BARKIS DO YOU MEAN YES STILL FEELING IN HIS POCKETS AND LOOKING OVER THEIR CONTENTS ITS ALL OVER WITH POOR BARKIS I AM AFRAID I SAW A LITTLE APOTHECARY THERESURGEON OR WHATEVER HE ISWHO BROUGHT YOUR WORSHIP INTO THE WORLD HE WAS MIGHTY LEARNED ABOUT THE CASE TO ME BUT THE UPSHOT OF HIS OPINION WAS THAT THE CARRIER WAS MAKING HIS LAST JOURNEY RATHER FASTPUT YOUR HAND INTO THE BREAST POCKET OF MY GREATCOAT ON THE CHAIR YONDER AND I THINK YOULL FIND THE LETTER IS IT THERE HERE IT IS SAID I THATS RIGHT IT WAS FROM PEGGOTTY SOMETHING LESS LEGIBLE THAN USUAL AND BRIEF IT INFORMED ME OF HER HUSBANDS HOPELESS STATE AND HINTED AT HIS BEING A LITTLE NEARER THAN HERETOFORE AND CONSEQUENTLY MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE FOR HIS OWN COMFORT IT SAID NOTHING OF HER WEARINESS AND WATCHING AND PRAISED HIM HIGHLY IT WAS WRITTEN WITH A PLAIN UNAFFECTED HOMELY PIETY THAT I KNEW TO BE GENUINE AND ENDED WITH MY DUTY TO MY EVER DARLINGMEANING MYSELF WHILE I DECIPHERED IT STEERFORTH CONTINUED TO EAT AND DRINK ITS A BAD JOB HE SAID WHEN I HAD DONE BUT THE SUN SETS EVERY DAY AND PEOPLE DIE EVERY MINUTE AND WE MUSTNT BE SCARED BY THE COMMON LOT IF WE FAILED TO HOLD OUR OWN BECAUSE THAT EQUAL FOOT AT ALL MENS DOORS WAS HEARD KNOCKING SOMEWHERE EVERY OBJECT IN THIS WORLD WOULD SLIP FROM US NO RIDE ON ROUGHSHOD IF NEED BE SMOOTHSHOD IF THAT WILL DO BUT RIDE ON RIDE ON OVER ALL OBSTACLES AND WIN THE RACE AND WIN WHAT RACE SAID I THE RACE THAT ONE HAS STARTED IN SAID HE RIDE ON I NOTICED I REMEMBER AS HE PAUSED LOOKING AT ME WITH HIS HANDSOME HEAD A LITTLE THROWN BACK AND HIS GLASS RAISED IN HIS HAND THAT THOUGH THE FRESHNESS OF THE SEAWIND WAS ON HIS FACE AND IT WAS RUDDY THERE WERE TRACES IN IT MADE SINCE I LAST SAW IT AS IF HE HAD APPLIED HIMSELF TO SOME HABITUAL STRAIN OF THE FERVENT ENERGY WHICH WHEN ROUSED WAS SO PASSIONATELY ROUSED WITHIN HIM I HAD IT IN MY THOUGHTS TO REMONSTRATE WITH HIM UPON HIS DESPERATE WAY OF PURSUING ANY FANCY THAT HE TOOKSUCH AS THIS BUFFETING OF ROUGH SEAS AND BRAVING OF HARD WEATHER FOR EXAMPLEWHEN MY MIND GLANCED OFF TO THE IMMEDIATE SUBJECT OF OUR CONVERSATION AGAIN AND PURSUED THAT INSTEAD I TELL YOU WHAT STEERFORTH SAID I IF YOUR HIGH SPIRITS WILL LISTEN TO ME THEY ARE POTENT SPIRITS AND WILL DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE HE ANSWERED MOVING FROM THE TABLE TO THE FIRESIDE AGAIN THEN I TELL YOU WHAT STEERFORTH I THINK I WILL GO DOWN AND SEE MY OLD NURSE IT IS NOT THAT I CAN DO HER ANY GOOD OR RENDER HER ANY REAL SERVICE BUT SHE IS SO ATTACHED TO ME THAT MY VISIT WILL HAVE AS MUCH EFFECT ON HER AS IF I COULD DO BOTH SHE WILL TAKE IT SO KINDLY THAT IT WILL BE A COMFORT AND SUPPORT TO HER IT IS NO GREAT EFFORT TO MAKE I AM SURE FOR SUCH A FRIEND AS SHE HAS BEEN TO ME WOULDNT YOU GO A DAYS JOURNEY IF YOU WERE IN MY PLACE HIS FACE WAS THOUGHTFUL AND HE SAT CONSIDERING A LITTLE BEFORE HE ANSWERED IN A LOW VOICE WELL GO YOU CAN DO NO HARM YOU HAVE JUST COME BACK SAID I AND IT WOULD BE IN VAIN TO ASK YOU TO GO WITH ME QUITE HE RETURNED I AM FOR HIGHGATE TONIGHT I HAVE NOT SEEN MY MOTHER THIS LONG TIME AND IT LIES UPON MY CONSCIENCE FOR ITS SOMETHING TO BE LOVED AS SHE LOVES HER PRODIGAL SONBAH NONSENSEYOU MEAN TO GO TOMORROW I SUPPOSE HE SAID HOLDING ME OUT AT ARMS LENGTH WITH A HAND ON EACH OF MY SHOULDERS YES I THINK SO WELL THEN DONT GO TILL NEXT DAY I WANTED YOU TO COME AND STAY A FEW DAYS WITH US HERE I AM ON PURPOSE TO BID YOU AND YOU FLY OFF TO YARMOUTH YOU ARE A NICE FELLOW TO TALK OF FLYING OFF STEERFORTH WHO ARE ALWAYS RUNNING WILD ON SOME UNKNOWN EXPEDITION OR OTHER HE LOOKED AT ME FOR A MOMENT WITHOUT SPEAKING AND THEN REJOINED STILL HOLDING ME AS BEFORE AND GIVING ME A SHAKE COME SAY THE NEXT DAY AND PASS AS MUCH OF TOMORROW AS YOU CAN WITH US WHO KNOWS WHEN WE MAY MEET AGAIN ELSE COME SAY THE NEXT DAY I WANT YOU TO STAND BETWEEN ROSA DARTLE AND ME AND KEEP US ASUNDER WOULD YOU LOVE EACH OTHER TOO MUCH WITHOUT ME YES OR HATE LAUGHED STEERFORTH NO MATTER WHICH COME SAY THE NEXT DAY I SAID THE NEXT DAY AND HE PUT ON HIS GREATCOAT AND LIGHTED HIS CIGAR AND SET OFF TO WALK HOME FINDING HIM IN THIS INTENTION I PUT ON MY OWN GREATCOAT BUT DID NOT LIGHT MY OWN CIGAR HAVING HAD ENOUGH OF THAT FOR ONE WHILE AND WALKED WITH HIM AS FAR AS THE OPEN ROAD A DULL ROAD THEN AT NIGHT HE WAS IN GREAT SPIRITS ALL THE WAY AND WHEN WE PARTED AND I LOOKED AFTER HIM GOING SO GALLANTLY AND AIRILY HOMEWARD I THOUGHT OF HIS SAYING RIDE ON OVER ALL OBSTACLES AND WIN THE RACE AND WISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HE HAD SOME WORTHY RACE TO RUN I WAS UNDRESSING IN MY OWN ROOM WHEN MR MICAWBERS LETTER TUMBLED ON THE FLOOR THUS REMINDED OF IT I BROKE THE SEAL AND READ AS FOLLOWS IT WAS DATED AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE DINNER I AM NOT SURE WHETHER I HAVE MENTIONED THAT WHEN MR MICAWBER WAS AT ANY PARTICULARLY DESPERATE CRISIS HE USED A SORT OF LEGAL PHRASEOLOGY WHICH HE SEEMED TO THINK EQUIVALENT TO WINDING UP HIS AFFAIRS SIRFOR I DARE NOT SAY MY DEAR COPPERFIELD IT IS EXPEDIENT THAT I SHOULD INFORM YOU THAT THE UNDERSIGNED IS CRUSHED SOME FLICKERING EFFORTS TO SPARE YOU THE PREMATURE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS CALAMITOUS POSITION YOU MAY OBSERVE IN HIM THIS DAY BUT HOPE HAS SUNK BENEATH THE HORIZON AND THE UNDERSIGNED IS CRUSHED THE PRESENT COMMUNICATION IS PENNED WITHIN THE PERSONAL RANGE I CANNOT CALL IT THE SOCIETY OF AN INDIVIDUAL IN A STATE CLOSELY BORDERING ON INTOXICATION EMPLOYED BY A BROKER THAT INDIVIDUAL IS IN LEGAL POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES UNDER A DISTRESS FOR RENT HIS INVENTORY INCLUDES NOT ONLY THE CHATTELS AND EFFECTS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION BELONGING TO THE UNDERSIGNED AS YEARLY TENANT OF THIS HABITATION BUT ALSO THOSE APPERTAINING TO MR THOMAS TRADDLES LODGER A MEMBER OF THE HONOURABLE SOCIETY OF THE INNER TEMPLE IF ANY DROP OF GLOOM WERE WANTING IN THE OVERFLOWING CUP WHICH IS NOW COMMENDED IN THE LANGUAGE OF AN IMMORTAL WRITER TO THE LIPS OF THE UNDERSIGNED IT WOULD BE FOUND IN THE FACT THAT A FRIENDLY ACCEPTANCE GRANTED TO THE UNDERSIGNED BY THE BEFOREMENTIONED MR THOMAS TRADDLES FOR THE SUM OF L S D IS OVER DUE AND IS NOT PROVIDED FOR ALSO IN THE FACT THAT THE LIVING RESPONSIBILITIES CLINGING TO THE UNDERSIGNED WILL IN THE COURSE OF NATURE BE INCREASED BY THE SUM OF ONE MORE HELPLESS VICTIM WHOSE MISERABLE APPEARANCE MAY BE LOOKED FORIN ROUND NUMBERSAT THE EXPIRATION OF A PERIOD NOT EXCEEDING SIX LUNAR MONTHS FROM THE PRESENT DATE AFTER PREMISING THUS MUCH IT WOULD BE A WORK OF SUPEREROGATION TO ADD THAT DUST AND ASHES ARE FOR EVER SCATTERED ON THE HEAD OF WILKINS MICAWBER POOR TRADDLES I KNEW ENOUGH OF MR MICAWBER BY THIS TIME TO FORESEE THAT HE MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO RECOVER THE BLOW BUT MY NIGHTS REST WAS SORELY DISTRESSED BY THOUGHTS OF TRADDLES AND OF THE CURATES DAUGHTER WHO WAS ONE OF TEN DOWN IN DEVONSHIRE AND WHO WAS SUCH A DEAR GIRL AND WHO WOULD WAIT FOR TRADDLES OMINOUS PRAISE UNTIL SHE WAS SIXTY OR ANY AGE THAT COULD BE MENTIONED CHAPTER I VISIT STEERFORTH AT HIS HOME AGAIN I MENTIONED TO MR SPENLOW IN THE MORNING THAT I WANTED LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR A SHORT TIME AND AS I WAS NOT IN THE RECEIPT OF ANY SALARY AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS NOT OBNOXIOUS TO THE IMPLACABLE JORKINS THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT IT I TOOK THAT OPPORTUNITY WITH MY VOICE STICKING IN MY THROAT AND MY SIGHT FAILING AS I UTTERED THE WORDS TO EXPRESS MY HOPE THAT MISS SPENLOW WAS QUITE WELL TO WHICH MR SPENLOW REPLIED WITH NO MORE EMOTION THAN IF HE HAD BEEN SPEAKING OF AN ORDINARY HUMAN BEING THAT HE WAS MUCH OBLIGED TO ME AND SHE WAS VERY WELL WE ARTICLED CLERKS AS GERMS OF THE PATRICIAN ORDER OF PROCTORS WERE TREATED WITH SO MUCH CONSIDERATION THAT I WAS ALMOST MY OWN MASTER AT ALL TIMES AS I DID NOT CARE HOWEVER TO GET TO HIGHGATE BEFORE ONE OR TWO OCLOCK IN THE DAY AND AS WE HAD ANOTHER LITTLE EXCOMMUNICATION CASE IN COURT THAT MORNING WHICH WAS CALLED THE OFFICE OF THE JUDGE PROMOTED BY TIPKINS AGAINST BULLOCK FOR HIS SOULS CORRECTION I PASSED AN HOUR OR TWO IN ATTENDANCE ON IT WITH MR SPENLOW VERY AGREEABLY IT AROSE OUT OF A SCUFFLE BETWEEN TWO CHURCHWARDENS ONE OF WHOM WAS ALLEGED TO HAVE PUSHED THE OTHER AGAINST A PUMP THE HANDLE OF WHICH PUMP PROJECTING INTO A SCHOOLHOUSE WHICH SCHOOLHOUSE WAS UNDER A GABLE OF THE CHURCHROOF MADE THE PUSH AN ECCLESIASTICAL OFFENCE IT WAS AN AMUSING CASE AND SENT ME UP TO HIGHGATE ON THE BOX OF THE STAGECOACH THINKING ABOUT THE COMMONS AND WHAT MR SPENLOW HAD SAID ABOUT TOUCHING THE COMMONS AND BRINGING DOWN THE COUNTRY MRS STEERFORTH WAS PLEASED TO SEE ME AND SO WAS ROSA DARTLE I WAS AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO FIND THAT LITTIMER WAS NOT THERE AND THAT WE WERE ATTENDED BY A MODEST LITTLE PARLOURMAID WITH BLUE RIBBONS IN HER CAP WHOSE EYE IT WAS MUCH MORE PLEASANT AND MUCH LESS DISCONCERTING TO CATCH BY ACCIDENT THAN THE EYE OF THAT RESPECTABLE MAN BUT WHAT I PARTICULARLY OBSERVED BEFORE I HAD BEEN HALFANHOUR IN THE HOUSE WAS THE CLOSE AND ATTENTIVE WATCH MISS DARTLE KEPT UPON ME AND THE LURKING MANNER IN WHICH SHE SEEMED TO COMPARE MY FACE WITH STEERFORTHS AND STEERFORTHS WITH MINE AND TO LIE IN WAIT FOR SOMETHING TO COME OUT BETWEEN THE TWO SO SURELY AS I LOOKED TOWARDS HER DID I SEE THAT EAGER VISAGE WITH ITS GAUNT BLACK EYES AND SEARCHING BROW INTENT ON MINE OR PASSING SUDDENLY FROM MINE TO STEERFORTHS OR COMPREHENDING BOTH OF US AT ONCE IN THIS LYNXLIKE SCRUTINY SHE WAS SO FAR FROM FALTERING WHEN SHE SAW I OBSERVED IT THAT AT SUCH A TIME SHE ONLY FIXED HER PIERCING LOOK UPON ME WITH A MORE INTENT EXPRESSION STILL BLAMELESS AS I WAS AND KNEW THAT I WAS IN REFERENCE TO ANY WRONG SHE COULD POSSIBLY SUSPECT ME OF I SHRUNK BEFORE HER STRANGE EYES QUITE UNABLE TO ENDURE THEIR HUNGRY LUSTRE ALL DAY SHE SEEMED TO PERVADE THE WHOLE HOUSE IF I TALKED TO STEERFORTH IN HIS ROOM I HEARD HER DRESS RUSTLE IN THE LITTLE GALLERY OUTSIDE WHEN HE AND I ENGAGED IN SOME OF OUR OLD EXERCISES ON THE LAWN BEHIND THE HOUSE I SAW HER FACE PASS FROM WINDOW TO WINDOW LIKE A WANDERING LIGHT UNTIL IT FIXED ITSELF IN ONE AND WATCHED US WHEN WE ALL FOUR WENT OUT WALKING IN THE AFTERNOON SHE CLOSED HER THIN HAND ON MY ARM LIKE A SPRING TO KEEP ME BACK WHILE STEERFORTH AND HIS MOTHER WENT ON OUT OF HEARING AND THEN SPOKE TO ME YOU HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME SHE SAID WITHOUT COMING HERE IS YOUR PROFESSION REALLY SO ENGAGING AND INTERESTING AS TO ABSORB YOUR WHOLE ATTENTION I ASK BECAUSE I ALWAYS WANT TO BE INFORMED WHEN I AM IGNORANT IS IT REALLY THOUGH I REPLIED THAT I LIKED IT WELL ENOUGH BUT THAT I CERTAINLY COULD NOT CLAIM SO MUCH FOR IT OH I AM GLAD TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE I ALWAYS LIKE TO BE PUT RIGHT WHEN I AM WRONG SAID ROSA DARTLE YOU MEAN IT IS A LITTLE DRY PERHAPS WELL I REPLIED PERHAPS IT WAS A LITTLE DRY OH AND THATS A REASON WHY YOU WANT RELIEF AND CHANGEEXCITEMENT AND ALL THAT SAID SHE AH VERY TRUE BUT ISNT IT A LITTLEEHFOR HIM I DONT MEAN YOU A QUICK GLANCE OF HER EYE TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE STEERFORTH WAS WALKING WITH HIS MOTHER LEANING ON HIS ARM SHOWED ME WHOM SHE MEANT BUT BEYOND THAT I WAS QUITE LOST AND I LOOKED SO I HAVE NO DOUBT DONT ITI DONT SAY THAT IT DOES MIND I WANT TO KNOWDONT IT RATHER ENGROSS HIM DONT IT MAKE HIM PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE REMISS THAN USUAL IN HIS VISITS TO HIS BLINDLYDOTINGEH WITH ANOTHER QUICK GLANCE AT THEM AND SUCH A GLANCE AT ME AS SEEMED TO LOOK INTO MY INNERMOST THOUGHTS MISS DARTLE I RETURNED PRAY DO NOT THINK I DONT SHE SAID OH DEAR ME DONT SUPPOSE THAT I THINK ANYTHING I AM NOT SUSPICIOUS I ONLY ASK A QUESTION I DONT STATE ANY OPINION I WANT TO FOUND AN OPINION ON WHAT YOU TELL ME THEN ITS NOT SO WELL I AM VERY GLAD TO KNOW IT IT CERTAINLY IS NOT THE FACT SAID I PERPLEXED THAT I AM ACCOUNTABLE FOR STEERFORTHS HAVING BEEN AWAY FROM HOME LONGER THAN USUALIF HE HAS BEEN WHICH I REALLY DONT KNOW AT THIS MOMENT UNLESS I UNDERSTAND IT FROM YOU I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM THIS LONG WHILE UNTIL LAST NIGHT NO INDEED MISS DARTLE NO AS SHE LOOKED FULL AT ME I SAW HER FACE GROW SHARPER AND PALER AND THE MARKS OF THE OLD WOUND LENGTHEN OUT UNTIL IT CUT THROUGH THE DISFIGURED LIP AND DEEP INTO THE NETHER LIP AND SLANTED DOWN THE FACE THERE WAS SOMETHING POSITIVELY AWFUL TO ME IN THIS AND IN THE BRIGHTNESS OF HER EYES AS SHE SAID LOOKING FIXEDLY AT ME WHAT IS HE DOING I REPEATED THE WORDS MORE TO MYSELF THAN HER BEING SO AMAZED WHAT IS HE DOING SHE SAID WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT SEEMED ENOUGH TO CONSUME HER LIKE A FIRE IN WHAT IS THAT MAN ASSISTING HIM WHO NEVER LOOKS AT ME WITHOUT AN INSCRUTABLE FALSEHOOD IN HIS EYES IF YOU ARE HONOURABLE AND FAITHFUL I DONT ASK YOU TO BETRAY YOUR FRIEND I ASK YOU ONLY TO TELL ME IS IT ANGER IS IT HATRED IS IT PRIDE IS IT RESTLESSNESS IS IT SOME WILD FANCY IS IT LOVE WHAT IS IT THAT IS LEADING HIM MISS DARTLE I RETURNED HOW SHALL I TELL YOU SO THAT YOU WILL BELIEVE ME THAT I KNOW OF NOTHING IN STEERFORTH DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THERE WAS WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE I CAN THINK OF NOTHING I FIRMLY BELIEVE THERE IS NOTHING I HARDLY UNDERSTAND EVEN WHAT YOU MEAN AS SHE STILL STOOD LOOKING FIXEDLY AT ME A TWITCHING OR THROBBING FROM WHICH I COULD NOT DISSOCIATE THE IDEA OF PAIN CAME INTO THAT CRUEL MARK AND LIFTED UP THE CORNER OF HER LIP AS IF WITH SCORN OR WITH A PITY THAT DESPISED ITS OBJECT SHE PUT HER HAND UPON IT HURRIEDLYA HAND SO THIN AND DELICATE THAT WHEN I HAD SEEN HER HOLD IT UP BEFORE THE FIRE TO SHADE HER FACE I HAD COMPARED IT IN MY THOUGHTS TO FINE PORCELAINAND SAYING IN A QUICK FIERCE PASSIONATE WAY I SWEAR YOU TO SECRECY ABOUT THIS SAID NOT A WORD MORE MRS STEERFORTH WAS PARTICULARLY HAPPY IN HER SONS SOCIETY AND STEERFORTH WAS ON THIS OCCASION PARTICULARLY ATTENTIVE AND RESPECTFUL TO HER IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO ME TO SEE THEM TOGETHER NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR MUTUAL AFFECTION BUT BECAUSE OF THE STRONG PERSONAL RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THEM AND THE MANNER IN WHICH WHAT WAS HAUGHTY OR IMPETUOUS IN HIM WAS SOFTENED BY AGE AND SEX IN HER TO A GRACIOUS DIGNITY I THOUGHT MORE THAN ONCE THAT IT WAS WELL NO SERIOUS CAUSE OF DIVISION HAD EVER COME BETWEEN THEM OR TWO SUCH NATURESI OUGHT RATHER TO EXPRESS IT TWO SUCH SHADES OF THE SAME NATUREMIGHT HAVE BEEN HARDER TO RECONCILE THAN THE TWO EXTREMEST OPPOSITES IN CREATION THE IDEA DID NOT ORIGINATE IN MY OWN DISCERNMENT I AM BOUND TO CONFESS BUT IN A SPEECH OF ROSA DARTLES SHE SAID AT DINNER OH BUT DO TELL ME THOUGH SOMEBODY BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT ALL DAY AND I WANT TO KNOW YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT ROSA RETURNED MRS STEERFORTH PRAY PRAY ROSA DO NOT BE MYSTERIOUS MYSTERIOUS SHE CRIED OH REALLY DO YOU CONSIDER ME SO DO I CONSTANTLY

AM SURE OF SHE ANSWERED WITH UNCOMMON FERVOUR IF I AM SURE OF ANYTHING OF COURSE YOU KNOW I AM SURE OF THAT MRS STEERFORTH APPEARED TO ME TO REGRET HAVING BEEN A LITTLE NETTLED FOR SHE PRESENTLY SAID IN A KIND TONE WELL MY DEAR ROSA WE HAVE NOT HEARD WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT TO BE SATISFIED ABOUT THAT I WANT TO BE SATISFIED ABOUT SHE REPLIED WITH PROVOKING COLDNESS OH IT WAS ONLY WHETHER PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE EACH OTHER IN THEIR MORAL CONSTITUTIONIS THAT THE PHRASE ITS AS GOOD A PHRASE AS ANOTHER SAID STEERFORTH THANK YOUWHETHER PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE EACH OTHER IN THEIR MORAL CONSTITUTION ARE IN GREATER DANGER THAN PEOPLE NOT SO CIRCUMSTANCED SUPPOSING ANY SERIOUS CAUSE OF VARIANCE TO ARISE BETWEEN THEM OF BEING DIVIDED ANGRILY AND DEEPLY I SHOULD SAY YES SAID STEERFORTH SHOULD YOU SHE

CIRCUMSTANCE CONNECTED WITH MISS DARTLE I MUST NOT OMIT FOR I HAD REASON TO REMEMBER IT THEREAFTER WHEN ALL THE IRREMEDIABLE PAST WAS RENDERED PLAIN DURING THE WHOLE OF THIS DAY BUT ESPECIALLY FROM THIS PERIOD OF IT STEERFORTH EXERTED HIMSELF WITH HIS UTMOST SKILL AND THAT WAS WITH HIS UTMOST EASE TO CHARM THIS SINGULAR CREATURE INTO A PLEASANT AND PLEASED COMPANION THAT HE SHOULD SUCCEED WAS NO MATTER OF SURPRISE TO ME THAT SHE SHOULD STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FASCINATING INFLUENCE OF HIS DELIGHTFUL ARTDELIGHTFUL NATURE I THOUGHT IT THENDID NOT SURPRISE ME EITHER FOR I KNEW THAT SHE WAS SOMETIMES JAUNDICED AND PERVERSE I SAW HER FEATURES AND HER MANNER SLOWLY CHANGE I SAW HER LOOK AT HIM WITH GROWING ADMIRATION I SAW HER TRY MORE AND MORE FAINTLY BUT ALWAYS ANGRILY AS IF SHE CONDEMNED A WEAKNESS IN HERSELF TO RESIST THE CAPTIVATING POWER THAT HE POSSESSED AND FINALLY I SAW HER SHARP GLANCE SOFTEN AND HER SMILE BECOME QUITE GENTLE AND I CEASED TO BE AFRAID OF HER AS I HAD REALLY BEEN ALL DAY AND WE ALL SAT ABOUT THE FIRE TALKING AND LAUGHING TOGETHER WITH AS LITTLE RESERVE AS IF WE HAD BEEN CHILDREN WHETHER IT WAS BECAUSE WE HAD SAT THERE SO LONG OR BECAUSE STEERFORTH WAS RESOLVED NOT TO LOSE THE ADVANTAGE HE HAD GAINED I DO NOT KNOW BUT WE DID NOT REMAIN IN THE DININGROOM MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES AFTER HER DEPARTURE SHE IS PLAYING HER HARP SAID STEERFORTH SOFTLY AT THE DRAWINGROOM DOOR AND NOBODY BUT MY MOTHER HAS HEARD HER DO THAT I BELIEVE THESE THREE YEARS HE SAID IT WITH A CURIOUS SMILE WHICH WAS GONE DIRECTLY AND WE WENT INTO THE ROOM AND FOUND HER ALONE DONT GET UP SAID STEERFORTH WHICH SHE HAD ALREADY DONE MY DEAR ROSA DONT BE KIND FOR ONCE AND SING US AN IRISH SONG WHAT DO YOU CARE FOR AN IRISH SONG SHE RETURNED MUCH SAID STEERFORTH MUCH MORE THAN FOR ANY OTHER HERE IS DAISY TOO LOVES MUSIC FROM HIS SOUL SING US AN IRISH SONG ROSA AND LET ME SIT AND LISTEN AS I USED TO DO HE DID NOT TOUCH HER OR THE CHAIR FROM WHICH SHE HAD RISEN BUT SAT HIMSELF NEAR THE HARP SHE STOOD BESIDE IT FOR SOME LITTLE WHILE IN A CURIOUS WAY GOING THROUGH THE MOTION OF PLAYING IT WITH HER RIGHT HAND BUT NOT SOUNDING IT AT LENGTH SHE SAT DOWN AND DREW IT TO HER WITH ONE SUDDEN ACTION AND PLAYED AND SANG I DONT KNOW WHAT IT WAS IN HER TOUCH OR VOICE THAT MADE THAT SONG THE MOST UNEARTHLY I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE OR CAN IMAGINE THERE WAS SOMETHING FEARFUL IN THE REALITY OF IT IT WAS AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN WRITTEN OR SET TO MUSIC BUT SPRUNG OUT OF PASSION WITHIN HER WHICH FOUND IMPERFECT UTTERANCE IN THE LOW SOUNDS OF HER VOICE AND CROUCHED AGAIN WHEN ALL WAS STILL I WAS DUMB WHEN SHE LEANED BESIDE THE HARP AGAIN PLAYING IT BUT NOT SOUNDING IT WITH HER RIGHT HAND A MINUTE MORE AND THIS HAD ROUSED ME FROM MY TRANCESTEERFORTH HAD LEFT HIS SEAT AND GONE TO HER AND HAD PUT HIS ARM LAUGHINGLY ABOUT HER AND HAD SAID COME ROSA FOR THE FUTURE WE WILL LOVE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH AND SHE HAD STRUCK HIM AND HAD THROWN HIM OFF WITH THE FURY OF A WILD CAT AND HAD BURST OUT OF THE ROOM WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ROSA SAID MRS STEERFORTH COMING IN SHE HAS BEEN AN ANGEL MOTHER RETURNED STEERFORTH FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND HAS RUN INTO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME SINCE BY WAY OF COMPENSATION YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO IRRITATE HER JAMES HER TEMPER HAS BEEN SOURED REMEMBER AND OUGHT NOT TO BE TRIED ROSA DID NOT COME BACK AND NO OTHER MENTION WAS MADE OF HER UNTIL I WENT WITH STEERFORTH INTO HIS ROOM TO SAY GOOD NIGHT THEN HE LAUGHED ABOUT HER AND ASKED ME IF I HAD EVER SEEN SUCH A FIERCE LITTLE PIECE OF INCOMPREHENSIBILITY I EXPRESSED AS MUCH OF MY ASTONISHMENT AS WAS THEN CAPABLE OF EXPRESSION AND ASKED IF HE COULD GUESS WHAT IT WAS THAT SHE HAD TAKEN SO MUCH AMISS SO SUDDENLY OH HEAVEN KNOWS SAID STEERFORTH ANYTHING YOU LIKEOR NOTHING I TOLD YOU SHE TOOK EVERYTHING HERSELF INCLUDED TO A GRINDSTONE AND SHARPENED IT SHE IS AN EDGETOOL AND REQUIRES GREAT CARE IN DEALING WITH SHE IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT SAID I MY DEAR STEERFORTH I SHALL BE GONE BEFORE YOU WAKE IN THE MORNING GOOD NIGHT HE WAS UNWILLING TO LET ME GO AND STOOD HOLDING ME OUT WITH A HAND ON EACH OF MY SHOULDERS AS HE HAD DONE IN MY OWN ROOM DAISY HE SAID WITH A SMILEFOR THOUGH THATS NOT THE NAME YOUR GODFATHERS AND GODMOTHERS GAVE YOU ITS THE NAME I LIKE BEST TO CALL YOU BYAND I WISH I WISH I WISH YOU COULD GIVE IT TO ME WHY SO I CAN IF I CHOOSE SAID I DAISY IF ANYTHING SHOULD EVER SEPARATE US YOU MUST THINK OF ME AT MY BEST OLD BOY COME LET US MAKE THAT BARGAIN THINK OF ME AT MY BEST IF CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD EVER PART US YOU HAVE NO BEST TO ME STEERFORTH SAID I AND NO WORST YOU ARE ALWAYS EQUALLY LOVED AND CHERISHED IN MY HEART SO MUCH COMPUNCTION FOR HAVING EVER WRONGED HIM EVEN BY A SHAPELESS THOUGHT DID I FEEL WITHIN ME THAT THE CONFESSION OF HAVING DONE SO WAS RISING TO MY LIPS BUT FOR THE RELUCTANCE I HAD TO BETRAY THE CONFIDENCE OF AGNES BUT FOR MY UNCERTAINTY HOW TO APPROACH THE SUBJECT WITH NO RISK OF DOING SO IT WOULD HAVE REACHED THEM BEFORE HE SAID GOD BLESS YOU DAISY AND GOOD NIGHT IN MY DOUBT IT DID NOT REACH THEM AND WE SHOOK HANDS AND WE PARTED I WAS UP WITH THE DULL DAWN AND HAVING DRESSED AS QUIETLY AS I COULD LOOKED INTO HIS ROOM HE WAS FAST ASLEEP LYING EASILY WITH HIS HEAD UPON HIS ARM AS I HAD OFTEN SEEN HIM LIE AT SCHOOL THE TIME CAME IN ITS SEASON AND THAT WAS VERY SOON WHEN I ALMOST WONDERED THAT NOTHING TROUBLED HIS REPOSE AS I LOOKED AT HIM BUT HE SLEPTLET ME THINK OF HIM SO AGAINAS I HAD OFTEN SEEN HIM SLEEP AT SCHOOL AND THUS IN THIS SILENT HOUR I LEFT HIM NEVER MORE OH GOD FORGIVE YOU STEERFORTH TO TOUCH THAT PASSIVE HAND IN LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP NEVER NEVER MORE CHAPTER A LOSS I GOT DOWN TO YARMOUTH IN THE EVENING AND WENT TO THE INN I KNEW THAT PEGGOTTYS SPARE ROOMMY ROOMWAS LIKELY TO HAVE OCCUPATION ENOUGH IN A LITTLE WHILE IF THAT GREAT VISITOR BEFORE WHOSE PRESENCE ALL THE LIVING MUST GIVE PLACE WERE NOT ALREADY IN THE HOUSE SO I BETOOK MYSELF TO THE INN AND DINED THERE AND ENGAGED MY BED IT WAS TEN OCLOCK WHEN I WENT OUT MANY OF THE SHOPS WERE SHUT AND THE TOWN WAS DULL WHEN I CAME TO OMER AND JORAMS I FOUND THE SHUTTERS UP BUT THE SHOP DOOR STANDING OPEN AS I COULD OBTAIN A

IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS THEIR REPORT WAS THAT MR BARKIS WAS AS BAD AS BAD COULD BE THAT HE WAS QUITE UNCONSCIOUS AND THAT MR CHILLIP HAD MOURNFULLY SAID IN THE KITCHEN ON GOING AWAY JUST NOW THAT THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS THE COLLEGE OF SURGEONS AND APOTHECARIES HALL IF THEY WERE ALL CALLED IN TOGETHER COULDNT HELP HIM HE WAS PAST BOTH COLLEGES MR CHILLIP SAID AND THE HALL COULD ONLY POISON HIM

DOOR OF MY LITTLE CHAMBER WHICH WAS DARK I HAD AN INDISTINCT IMPRESSION OF HER BEING WITHIN IT CAST DOWN UPON THE FLOOR BUT WHETHER IT WAS REALLY SHE OR WHETHER IT WAS A CONFUSION OF THE SHADOWS IN THE ROOM I DONT KNOW NOW I HAD LEISURE TO THINK BEFORE THE KITCHEN FIRE OF PRETTY LITTLE EMILYS DREAD OF DEATHWHICH ADDED TO WHAT MR OMER HAD TOLD ME I TOOK TO BE THE CAUSE OF HER BEING SO UNLIKE HERSELFAND I HAD LEISURE BEFORE PEGGOTTY CAME DOWN EVEN TO THINK MORE LENIENTLY OF THE WEAKNESS OF IT AS I SAT COUNTING THE TICKING OF THE CLOCK AND DEEPENING MY SENSE OF THE SOLEMN HUSH AROUND ME PEGGOTTY TOOK ME IN HER ARMS AND BLESSED AND THANKED ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR BEING SUCH A COMFORT TO HER THAT WAS WHAT SHE SAID IN HER DISTRESS SHE THEN ENTREATED ME TO COME UPSTAIRS SOBBING THAT MR BARKIS HAD ALWAYS LIKED ME AND ADMIRED ME THAT HE HAD OFTEN TALKED OF ME BEFORE HE FELL INTO A STUPOR AND THAT SHE BELIEVED IN CASE OF HIS COMING TO HIMSELF AGAIN HE WOULD BRIGHTEN UP AT SIGHT OF ME IF HE COULD BRIGHTEN UP AT ANY EARTHLY THING THE PROBABILITY OF HIS EVER DOING SO APPEARED TO ME WHEN I SAW HIM TO BE VERY SMALL HE WAS LYING WITH HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS OUT OF BED IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE ATTITUDE HALF RESTING ON THE BOX WHICH HAD COST HIM SO MUCH PAIN AND TROUBLE I LEARNED THAT WHEN HE WAS PAST CREEPING OUT OF BED TO OPEN IT AND PAST ASSURING HIMSELF OF ITS SAFETY BY MEANS OF THE DIVINING ROD I HAD SEEN HIM USE HE HAD REQUIRED TO HAVE IT PLACED ON THE CHAIR AT THE BEDSIDE WHERE HE HAD EVER SINCE EMBRACED IT NIGHT AND DAY HIS ARM LAY ON IT NOW TIME AND THE WORLD WERE SLIPPING FROM BENEATH HIM BUT THE BOX WAS THERE AND THE LAST WORDS HE HAD UTTERED WERE IN AN EXPLANATORY TONE OLD CLOTHES BARKIS MY DEAR SAID PEGGOTTY ALMOST CHEERFULLY BENDING OVER HIM WHILE HER BROTHER AND I STOOD AT THE BEDS FOOT HERES MY DEAR BOYMY DEAR BOY MASTER DAVY WHO BROUGHT US TOGETHER BARKIS THAT YOU SENT MESSAGES BY YOU KNOW WONT YOU SPEAK TO MASTER DAVY HE WAS AS MUTE AND SENSELESS AS THE BOX FROM WHICH HIS FORM DERIVED THE ONLY EXPRESSION IT HAD HES A GOING OUT WITH THE TIDE SAID MR PEGGOTTY TO ME BEHIND HIS HAND MY EYES WERE DIM AND SO WERE MR PEGGOTTYS BUT I REPEATED IN A WHISPER WITH THE TIDE PEOPLE CANT DIE ALONG THE COAST SAID MR PEGGOTTY EXCEPT WHEN THE TIDES PRETTY NIGH OUT THEY CANT BE BORN UNLESS ITS PRETTY NIGH INNOT PROPERLY BORN TILL FLOOD HES A GOING OUT WITH THE TIDE ITS EBB AT HALFARTER THREE SLACK WATER HALF AN HOUR IF HE LIVES TILL IT TURNS HELL HOLD HIS OWN TILL PAST THE FLOOD AND GO OUT WITH THE NEXT TIDE WE REMAINED THERE WATCHING HIM A LONG TIMEHOURS WHAT MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE MY PRESENCE HAD UPON HIM IN THAT STATE OF HIS SENSES I SHALL NOT PRETEND TO SAY BUT WHEN HE AT LAST BEGAN TO WANDER FEEBLY IT IS CERTAIN HE WAS MUTTERING ABOUT DRIVING ME TO SCHOOL HES COMING TO HIMSELF SAID PEGGOTTY MR PEGGOTTY TOUCHED ME AND WHISPERED WITH MUCH AWE AND REVERENCE THEY ARE BOTH AGOING OUT FAST BARKIS MY DEAR SAID PEGGOTTY C P BARKIS HE CRIED FAINTLY NO BETTER WOMAN ANYWHERE LOOK HERES MASTER DAVY SAID PEGGOTTY FOR HE NOW OPENED HIS EYES I WAS ON THE POINT OF ASKING HIM IF HE KNEW ME WHEN HE TRIED TO STRETCH OUT HIS ARM AND SAID TO ME DISTINCTLY WITH A PLEASANT SMILE BARKIS IS WILLIN AND IT BEING LOW WATER HE WENT OUT WITH THE TIDE CHAPTER A GREATER LOSS IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ME ON PEGGOTTYS SOLICITATION TO RESOLVE TO STAY WHERE I WAS UNTIL AFTER THE REMAINS OF THE POOR CARRIER SHOULD HAVE MADE THEIR LAST JOURNEY TO BLUNDERSTONE SHE HAD LONG AGO BOUGHT OUT OF HER OWN SAVINGS A LITTLE PIECE OF GROUND IN OUR OLD CHURCHYARD NEAR THE GRAVE OF HER SWEET GIRL AS SHE ALWAYS CALLED MY MOTHER AND THERE THEY WERE TO REST IN KEEPING PEGGOTTY COMPANY AND DOING ALL I COULD FOR HER LITTLE ENOUGH AT THE UTMOST I WAS AS GRATEFUL I REJOICE TO THINK AS EVEN NOW I COULD WISH MYSELF TO HAVE BEEN BUT I AM AFRAID I HAD A SUPREME SATISFACTION OF A PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL NATURE IN TAKING CHARGE OF MR BARKISS WILL AND EXPOUNDING ITS CONTENTS I MAY CLAIM THE MERIT OF HAVING ORIGINATED THE SUGGESTION THAT THE WILL SHOULD BE LOOKED FOR IN THE BOX AFTER SOME SEARCH IT WAS FOUND IN THE BOX AT THE BOTTOM OF A HORSES NOSEBAG WHEREIN BESIDES HAY THERE WAS DISCOVERED AN OLD GOLD WATCH WITH CHAIN AND SEALS WHICH MR BARKIS HAD WORN ON HIS WEDDINGDAY AND WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE OR SINCE A SILVER TOBACCOSTOPPER IN THE FORM OF A LEG AN IMITATION LEMON FULL OF MINUTE CUPS AND SAUCERS WHICH I HAVE SOME IDEA MR BARKIS MUST HAVE PURCHASED TO PRESENT TO ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND AFTERWARDS FOUND HIMSELF UNABLE TO PART WITH EIGHTYSEVEN GUINEAS AND A HALF IN GUINEAS AND HALFGUINEAS TWO HUNDRED AND TEN POUNDS IN PERFECTLY CLEAN BANK NOTES CERTAIN RECEIPTS FOR BANK OF ENGLAND STOCK AN OLD HORSESHOE A BAD SHILLING A PIECE OF CAMPHOR AND AN OYSTERSHELL FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE LATTER ARTICLE HAVING BEEN MUCH POLISHED AND DISPLAYING PRISMATIC COLOURS ON THE INSIDE I CONCLUDE THAT MR BARKIS HAD SOME GENERAL IDEAS ABOUT PEARLS WHICH NEVER RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO ANYTHING DEFINITE FOR YEARS AND YEARS MR BARKIS HAD CARRIED THIS BOX ON ALL HIS JOURNEYS EVERY DAY THAT IT MIGHT THE BETTER ESCAPE NOTICE HE HAD INVENTED A FICTION THAT IT BELONGED TO MR BLACKBOY AND WAS TO BE LEFT WITH BARKIS TILL CALLED FOR A FABLE HE HAD ELABORATELY WRITTEN ON THE LID IN CHARACTERS NOW SCARCELY LEGIBLE HE HAD HOARDED ALL THESE YEARS I FOUND TO GOOD PURPOSE HIS PROPERTY IN MONEY AMOUNTED TO NEARLY THREE THOUSAND POUNDS OF THIS HE BEQUEATHED THE INTEREST OF ONE THOUSAND TO MR PEGGOTTY FOR HIS LIFE ON HIS DECEASE THE PRINCIPAL TO BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN PEGGOTTY LITTLE EMILY AND ME OR THE SURVIVOR OR SURVIVORS OF US SHARE AND SHARE ALIKE ALL THE REST HE DIED POSSESSED OF HE BEQUEATHED TO PEGGOTTY WHOM HE LEFT RESIDUARY LEGATEE AND SOLE EXECUTRIX OF THAT HIS LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT I FELT MYSELF QUITE A PROCTOR WHEN I READ THIS DOCUMENT ALOUD WITH ALL POSSIBLE CEREMONY AND SET FORTH ITS PROVISIONS ANY NUMBER OF TIMES TO THOSE WHOM THEY CONCERNED I BEGAN TO THINK THERE WAS MORE IN THE COMMONS THAN I HAD SUPPOSED I EXAMINED THE WILL WITH THE DEEPEST ATTENTION PRONOUNCED IT PERFECTLY FORMAL IN ALL RESPECTS MADE A PENCILMARK OR SO IN THE MARGIN AND THOUGHT IT RATHER EXTRAORDINARY THAT I KNEW SO MUCH IN THIS ABSTRUSE PURSUIT IN MAKING AN ACCOUNT FOR PEGGOTTY OF ALL THE PROPERTY INTO WHICH SHE HAD COME IN ARRANGING ALL THE AFFAIRS IN AN ORDERLY MANNER AND IN BEING HER REFEREE AND ADVISER ON EVERY POINT TO OUR JOINT DELIGHT I PASSED THE WEEK BEFORE THE FUNERAL I DID NOT SEE LITTLE EMILY IN THAT INTERVAL BUT THEY TOLD ME SHE WAS TO BE QUIETLY MARRIED IN A FORTNIGHT I DID NOT ATTEND THE FUNERAL IN CHARACTER IF I MAY VENTURE TO SAY SO I MEAN I WAS NOT DRESSED UP IN A BLACK COAT AND A STREAMER TO FRIGHTEN THE BIRDS BUT I WALKED OVER TO BLUNDERSTONE EARLY IN THE MORNING AND WAS IN THE CHURCHYARD WHEN IT CAME ATTENDED ONLY BY PEGGOTTY AND HER BROTHER THE MAD GENTLEMAN LOOKED ON OUT OF MY LITTLE WINDOW MR CHILLIPS BABY WAGGED ITS HEAVY HEAD AND ROLLED ITS GOGGLE EYES AT THE CLERGYMAN OVER ITS NURSES SHOULDER MR OMER BREATHED SHORT IN THE BACKGROUND NO ONE ELSE WAS THERE AND IT WAS VERY QUIET WE WALKED ABOUT THE CHURCHYARD FOR AN HOUR AFTER ALL WAS OVER AND PULLED SOME YOUNG LEAVES FROM THE TREE ABOVE MY MOTHERS GRAVE A DREAD FALLS ON ME HERE A CLOUD IS LOWERING ON THE DISTANT TOWN TOWARDS WHICH I RETRACED MY SOLITARY STEPS I FEAR TO APPROACH IT I CANNOT BEAR TO THINK OF WHAT DID COME UPON THAT MEMORABLE NIGHT OF WHAT MUST COME AGAIN IF I GO ON IT IS NO WORSE BECAUSE I WRITE OF IT IT WOULD BE NO BETTER IF I STOPPED MY MOST UNWILLING HAND IT IS DONE NOTHING CAN UNDO IT NOTHING CAN MAKE IT OTHERWISE THAN AS IT WAS MY OLD NURSE WAS TO GO TO LONDON WITH ME NEXT DAY ON THE BUSINESS OF THE WILL LITTLE EMILY WAS PASSING THAT DAY AT MR OMERS WE WERE ALL TO MEET IN THE OLD BOATHOUSE THAT NIGHT HAM WOULD BRING EMILY AT THE USUAL HOUR I WOULD WALK BACK AT MY LEISURE THE BROTHER AND SISTER WOULD RETURN AS THEY HAD COME AND BE EXPECTING US WHEN THE DAY CLOSED IN AT THE FIRESIDE I PARTED FROM THEM AT THE WICKETGATE WHERE VISIONARY STRAP HAD RESTED WITH RODERICK RANDOMS KNAPSACK IN THE DAYS OF YORE AND INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT BACK WALKED A LITTLE DISTANCE ON THE ROAD TO LOWESTOFT THEN I TURNED AND WALKED BACK TOWARDS YARMOUTH I STAYED TO DINE AT A DECENT ALEHOUSE SOME MILE OR TWO FROM THE FERRY I HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE AND THUS THE DAY WORE AWAY AND IT WAS EVENING WHEN I REACHED IT RAIN WAS FALLING HEAVILY BY THAT TIME AND IT WAS A WILD NIGHT BUT THERE WAS A MOON BEHIND THE CLOUDS AND IT WAS NOT DARK I WAS SOON WITHIN SIGHT OF MR PEGGOTTYS HOUSE AND OF THE LIGHT WITHIN IT SHINING THROUGH THE WINDOW A LITTLE FLOUNDERING ACROSS THE SAND WHICH WAS HEAVY BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR AND I WENT IN IT LOOKED VERY COMFORTABLE INDEED MR PEGGOTTY HAD SMOKED HIS EVENING PIPE AND THERE WERE PREPARATIONS FOR SOME SUPPER BY AND BY THE FIRE WAS BRIGHT THE ASHES WERE THROWN UP THE LOCKER WAS READY FOR LITTLE EMILY IN HER OLD PLACE IN HER OWN OLD PLACE SAT PEGGOTTY ONCE MORE LOOKING BUT FOR HER DRESS AS IF SHE HAD NEVER LEFT IT SHE HAD FALLEN BACK ALREADY ON THE

QUALITIES THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM A MAN OF A NOBLE NATURE AND A GREAT NAME THAN EVER I HAD DONE IN THE HEIGHT OF MY DEVOTION TO HIM DEEPLY AS I FELT MY OWN UNCONSCIOUS PART IN HIS POLLUTION OF AN HONEST HOME I BELIEVED THAT IF I HAD BEEN BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH HIM I COULD NOT HAVE UTTERED ONE REPROACH I SHOULD HAVE LOVED HIM SO WELL STILLTHOUGH HE FASCINATED ME NO LONGERI SHOULD HAVE HELD IN SO MUCH TENDERNESS THE MEMORY OF MY AFFECTION FOR HIM THAT I THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN AS WEAK AS A SPIRITWOUNDED CHILD IN ALL BUT THE ENTERTAINMENT OF A THOUGHT THAT WE COULD EVER BE REUNITED THAT THOUGHT I NEVER HAD I FELT AS HE HAD FELT THAT ALL WAS AT AN END BETWEEN US WHAT HIS REMEMBRANCES OF ME WERE I HAVE NEVER KNOWNTHEY WERE LIGHT ENOUGH PERHAPS AND EASILY DISMISSEDBUT MINE OF HIM WERE

OF IT AT THEIR DOORS MANY WERE HARD UPON HER SOME FEW WERE HARD UPON HIM BUT TOWARDS HER SECOND FATHER AND HER LOVER THERE WAS BUT ONE SENTIMENT AMONG ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE A RESPECT FOR THEM IN THEIR DISTRESS PREVAILED WHICH WAS FULL OF GENTLENESS AND DELICACY THE SEAFARING MEN KEPT APART WHEN THOSE TWO WERE SEEN EARLY WALKING WITH SLOW STEPS ON THE BEACH AND STOOD IN KNOTS TALKING COMPASSIONATELY AMONG THEMSELVES IT WAS ON THE BEACH CLOSE DOWN BY THE SEA THAT I FOUND THEM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT SLEPT ALL LAST NIGHT EVEN IF PEGGOTTY HAD FAILED TO TELL ME OF THEIR STILL SITTING JUST AS I LEFT THEM WHEN IT WAS BROAD DAY THEY LOOKED WORN AND I THOUGHT MR PEGGOTTYS HEAD WAS BOWED IN ONE NIGHT MORE THAN IN ALL THE YEARS I HAD KNOWN HIM BUT THEY WERE BOTH AS GRAVE

WHAT A CHANGE IN MRS GUMMIDGE IN A LITTLE TIME SHE WAS ANOTHER WOMAN SHE WAS SO DEVOTED SHE HAD SUCH A QUICK PERCEPTION OF WHAT IT WOULD BE WELL TO SAY AND WHAT IT WOULD BE WELL TO LEAVE UNSAID SHE WAS SO FORGETFUL OF HERSELF AND SO REGARDFUL OF THE SORROW ABOUT HER THAT I HELD HER IN A SORT OF VENERATION THE WORK SHE DID THAT DAY THERE WERE MANY THINGS TO BE BROUGHT UP FROM THE BEACH AND STORED IN THE OUTHOUSEAS OARS NETS SAILS CORDAGE SPARS LOBSTERPOTS BAGS OF BALLAST AND THE LIKE AND THOUGH THERE WAS ABUNDANCE OF ASSISTANCE RENDERED THERE BEING NOT A PAIR OF WORKING HANDS ON ALL THAT SHORE BUT WOULD HAVE LABOURED HARD FOR MR PEGGOTTY AND BEEN WELL PAID IN BEING ASKED TO DO IT YET SHE PERSISTED ALL DAY LONG IN TOILING UNDER WEIGHTS THAT SHE WAS QUITE UNEQUAL TO AND FAGGING TO AND FRO ON ALL SORTS OF UNNECESSARY ERRANDS AS TO DEPLORING HER MISFORTUNES SHE APPEARED TO HAVE ENTIRELY LOST THE RECOLLECTION OF EVER HAVING HAD ANY SHE PRESERVED AN EQUABLE CHEERFULNESS IN THE MIDST OF HER SYMPATHY WHICH WAS NOT THE LEAST ASTONISHING PART OF THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME OVER HER QUERULOUSNESS WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION I DID NOT EVEN OBSERVE HER VOICE TO FALTER OR A TEAR TO ESCAPE FROM HER EYES THE WHOLE DAY THROUGH UNTIL TWILIGHT WHEN SHE AND I AND MR PEGGOTTY BEING ALONE TOGETHER AND HE HAVING FALLEN ASLEEP IN PERFECT EXHAUSTION SHE BROKE INTO A HALFSUPPRESSED FIT OF SOBBING AND CRYING AND TAKING ME TO THE DOOR SAID EVER BLESS YOU MASR DAVY BE A FRIEND TO HIM POOR DEAR THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE TO WASH HER FACE IN ORDER THAT SHE MIGHT SIT QUIETLY BESIDE HIM AND BE FOUND AT WORK THERE WHEN HE SHOULD AWAKE IN SHORT I LEFT HER WHEN I WENT AWAY AT NIGHT THE PROP AND STAFF OF MR PEGGOTTYS AFFLICTION AND I COULD NOT MEDITATE ENOUGH UPON THE LESSON THAT I READ IN MRS GUMMIDGE AND THE NEW EXPERIENCE SHE UNFOLDED TO ME IT WAS BETWEEN NINE AND TEN OCLOCK WHEN STROLLING IN A MELANCHOLY MANNER THROUGH THE TOWN I STOPPED AT MR OMERS DOOR MR OMER HAD TAKEN IT SO MUCH TO HEART HIS DAUGHTER TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY LOW AND POORLY ALL DAY AND HAD GONE TO BED WITHOUT HIS PIPE A DECEITFUL BADHEARTED GIRL SAID MRS JORAM THERE WAS NO GOOD IN HER EVER DONT SAY SO I RETURNED YOU DONT THINK SO YES I DO CRIED MRS JORAM ANGRILY NO NO SAID I MRS JORAM TOSSED HER HEAD ENDEAVOURING TO BE VERY STERN AND CROSS BUT SHE COULD NOT COMMAND HER SOFTER SELF AND BEGAN TO CRY I WAS YOUNG TO BE SURE BUT I THOUGHT MUCH THE BETTER OF HER FOR THIS SYMPATHY AND FANCIED IT BECAME HER AS A VIRTUOUS WIFE AND MOTHER VERY WELL INDEED WHAT WILL SHE EVER DO SOBBED MINNIE WHERE WILL SHE GO WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER OH HOW COULD SHE BE SO CRUEL TO HERSELF AND HIM I REMEMBERED THE TIME WHEN MINNIE WAS A YOUNG AND PRETTY GIRL AND I WAS GLAD SHE REMEMBERED IT TOO SO FEELINGLY MY LITTLE MINNIE SAID MRS JORAM HAS ONLY JUST NOW BEEN GOT TO SLEEP EVEN IN HER SLEEP SHE IS SOBBING FOR EMLY ALL DAY LONG LITTLE MINNIE HAS CRIED FOR HER AND ASKED ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHETHER EMLY WAS WICKED WHAT CAN I SAY TO HER WHEN EMLY TIED A RIBBON OFF HER OWN NECK ROUND LITTLE MINNIES THE LAST NIGHT SHE WAS HERE AND LAID HER HEAD DOWN ON THE PILLOW BESIDE HER TILL SHE WAS FAST ASLEEP THE RIBBONS ROUND MY LITTLE MINNIES NECK NOW IT OUGHT NOT TO BE PERHAPS BUT WHAT CAN I DO EMLY IS VERY BAD BUT THEY WERE FOND OF ONE ANOTHER AND THE CHILD KNOWS NOTHING MRS JORAM WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT HER HUSBAND CAME OUT TO TAKE CARE OF HER LEAVING THEM TOGETHER I WENT HOME TO PEGGOTTYS MORE MELANCHOLY MYSELF IF POSSIBLE THAN I HAD BEEN YET THAT GOOD CREATUREI MEAN PEGGOTTYALL UNTIRED BY HER LATE ANXIETIES AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS WAS AT HER BROTHERS WHERE SHE MEANT TO STAY TILL MORNING AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR SOME WEEKS PAST WHILE PEGGOTTY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEND TO IT WAS THE HOUSES ONLY OTHER OCCUPANT BESIDES MYSELF AS I HAD NO OCCASION FOR HER SERVICES I SENT HER TO BED BY NO MEANS AGAINST HER WILL AND SAT DOWN BEFORE THE KITCHEN FIRE A LITTLE WHILE TO THINK ABOUT ALL THIS I WAS BLENDING IT WITH THE DEATHBED OF THE LATE MR BARKIS AND WAS DRIVING OUT WITH THE TIDE TOWARDS THE DISTANCE AT WHICH HAM HAD LOOKED SO SINGULARLY IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAS RECALLED FROM MY WANDERINGS BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR THERE WAS A KNOCKER UPON THE DOOR BUT IT WAS NOT THAT WHICH MADE THE SOUND THE TAP WAS FROM A HAND AND LOW DOWN UPON THE DOOR AS IF IT WERE GIVEN BY A CHILD IT MADE ME START AS MUCH AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE KNOCK OF A FOOTMAN TO A PERSON OF DISTINCTION I OPENED THE DOOR AND AT FIRST LOOKED DOWN TO MY AMAZEMENT ON NOTHING BUT A GREAT UMBRELLA THAT APPEARED TO BE WALKING ABOUT OF ITSELF BUT PRESENTLY I DISCOVERED UNDERNEATH IT MISS MOWCHER I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO GIVE THE LITTLE CREATURE A VERY KIND RECEPTION IF ON HER REMOVING THE UMBRELLA WHICH HER UTMOST EFFORTS WERE UNABLE TO SHUT UP SHE HAD SHOWN ME THE VOLATILE EXPRESSION OF FACE WHICH HAD MADE SO GREAT AN IMPRESSION ON ME AT OUR FIRST AND LAST MEETING BUT HER FACE AS SHE TURNED IT UP TO MINE WAS SO EARNEST AND WHEN I RELIEVED HER OF THE UMBRELLA WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN AN INCONVENIENT ONE FOR THE IRISH GIANT SHE WRUNG HER LITTLE HANDS IN SUCH AN AFFLICTED MANNER THAT I RATHER INCLINED TOWARDS HER MISS MOWCHER SAID I AFTER GLANCING UP AND DOWN THE EMPTY STREET WITHOUT DISTINCTLY KNOWING WHAT I EXPECTED TO SEE BESIDES HOW DO YOU COME HERE WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE MOTIONED TO ME WITH HER SHORT RIGHT ARM TO SHUT THE UMBRELLA FOR HER AND PASSING ME HURRIEDLY WENT INTO THE KITCHEN WHEN I HAD CLOSED THE DOOR AND FOLLOWED WITH THE UMBRELLA IN MY HAND I FOUND HER SITTING ON THE CORNER OF THE FENDERIT WAS A LOW IRON ONE WITH TWO FLAT BARS AT TOP TO STAND PLATES UPONIN THE SHADOW OF THE BOILER SWAYING HERSELF BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND CHAFING HER HANDS UPON HER KNEES LIKE A PERSON IN PAIN QUITE ALARMED AT BEING THE ONLY RECIPIENT OF THIS UNTIMELY VISIT AND THE ONLY SPECTATOR OF THIS PORTENTOUS BEHAVIOUR I EXCLAIMED AGAIN PRAY TELL ME MISS MOWCHER WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE YOU ILL MY DEAR YOUNG SOUL RETURNED MISS MOWCHER SQUEEZING HER HANDS UPON HER HEART ONE OVER THE OTHER I AM ILL HERE I AM VERY ILL TO THINK THAT IT SHOULD COME TO THIS WHEN I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN IT AND PERHAPS PREVENTED IT IF I HADNT BEEN A THOUGHTLESS FOOL AGAIN HER LARGE BONNET VERY DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE FIGURE WENT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN HER SWAYING OF HER LITTLE BODY TO AND FRO WHILE A MOST GIGANTIC BONNET ROCKED IN UNISON WITH IT UPON THE WALL I AM SURPRISED I BEGAN TO SEE YOU SO DISTRESSED AND SERIOUSWHEN SHE INTERRUPTED ME YES ITS ALWAYS SO SHE SAID THEY ARE ALL SURPRISED THESE INCONSIDERATE YOUNG PEOPLE FAIRLY AND FULL GROWN TO SEE ANY NATURAL FEELING IN A LITTLE THING LIKE ME THEY MAKE A PLAYTHING OF ME USE ME FOR THEIR AMUSEMENT THROW ME AWAY WHEN THEY ARE TIRED AND WONDER THAT I FEEL MORE THAN A TOY HORSE OR A WOODEN SOLDIER YES YES THATS THE WAY THE OLD WAY IT MAY BE WITH OTHERS I RETURNED BUT I DO ASSURE YOU IT IS NOT WITH ME PERHAPS I OUGHT NOT TO BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO SEE YOU AS YOU ARE NOW I KNOW SO LITTLE OF YOU I SAID WITHOUT CONSIDERATION WHAT I THOUGHT WHAT CAN I DO RETURNED THE LITTLE WOMAN STANDING UP AND HOLDING OUT HER ARMS TO SHOW HERSELF SEE WHAT I AM MY FATHER WAS AND MY SISTER IS AND MY BROTHER IS I HAVE WORKED FOR SISTER AND BROTHER THESE MANY YEARSHARD MR COPPERFIELDALL DAY I MUST LIVE I DO NO HARM IF THERE ARE PEOPLE SO UNREFLECTING

HAD SHOWN MYSELF A SENSITIVE DWARF TO YOUR FALSE FRIEND PURSUED THE LITTLE WOMAN SHAKING HER HEAD AT ME WITH REPROACHFUL EARNESTNESS HOW MUCH OF HIS HELP OR GOOD WILL DO YOU THINK I SHOULD EVER HAVE HAD IF LITTLE MOWCHER WHO HAD NO HAND YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN THE MAKING OF HERSELF ADDRESSED HERSELF TO HIM OR THE LIKE OF HIM BECAUSE OF HER MISFORTUNES WHEN DO YOU SUPPOSE HER SMALL VOICE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARD LITTLE MOWCHER WOULD HAVE AS MUCH NEED TO LIVE IF SHE WAS THE BITTEREST AND DULLEST OF PIGMIES BUT SHE COULDNT DO IT NO SHE MIGHT WHISTLE FOR HER BREAD AND BUTTER TILL SHE DIED OF AIR MISS MOWCHER SAT DOWN ON THE FENDER AGAIN AND TOOK OUT HER HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HER EYES BE THANKFUL FOR ME IF YOU HAVE A KIND HEART AS I THINK YOU HAVE SHE SAID THAT WHILE I KNOW WELL WHAT I AM I CAN BE CHEERFUL AND ENDURE IT ALL I AM THANKFUL FOR MYSELF AT ANY RATE THAT I CAN FIND MY TINY WAY THROUGH THE WORLD WITHOUT BEING BEHOLDEN TO ANYONE AND THAT IN RETURN FOR ALL THAT IS THROWN AT ME IN FOLLY

SEEING NOTHING BUT MR PEGGOTTY ON THE ROOF THROUGH THE TEARS SHE TRIED TO REPRESS AND DASHING HERSELF AGAINST THE PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION I SHOULD ENTER ON A TASK OF SOME DIFFICULTY THEREFORE I HAD BETTER LEAVE HER SITTING ON A BAKERS DOORSTEP OUT OF BREATH WITH NO SHAPE AT ALL REMAINING IN HER BONNET AND ONE OF HER SHOES OFF LYING ON THE PAVEMENT AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE WHEN WE GOT TO OUR JOURNEYS END OUR FIRST PURSUIT WAS TO LOOK ABOUT FOR A LITTLE LODGING FOR PEGGOTTY WHERE HER BROTHER COULD HAVE A BED WE WERE SO FORTUNATE AS TO FIND ONE OF A VERY CLEAN AND CHEAP DESCRIPTION OVER A CHANDLERS SHOP ONLY TWO STREETS REMOVED FROM ME WHEN WE HAD ENGAGED THIS DOMICILE I BOUGHT SOME COLD MEAT AT AN EATINGHOUSE AND TOOK MY FELLOWTRAVELLERS HOME TO TEA A PROCEEDING I REGRET TO STATE WHICH DID NOT MEET WITH MRS CRUPPS APPROVAL BUT QUITE THE CONTRARY I OUGHT TO OBSERVE HOWEVER IN EXPLANATION OF THAT LADYS STATE OF MIND THAT SHE WAS MUCH OFFENDED BY PEGGOTTYS TUCKING UP HER WIDOWS GOWN BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN TEN MINUTES IN THE PLACE AND SETTING TO WORK TO DUST MY BEDROOM THIS MRS CRUPP REGARDED IN THE LIGHT OF A LIBERTY AND A LIBERTY SHE SAID WAS A THING SHE NEVER ALLOWED MR PEGGOTTY HAD MADE A COMMUNICATION TO ME ON THE WAY TO LONDON FOR WHICH I WAS NOT UNPREPARED IT WAS THAT HE PURPOSED FIRST SEEING MRS STEERFORTH AS I FELT BOUND TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS AND ALSO TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THEM WITH THE VIEW OF SPARING THE MOTHERS FEELINGS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I WROTE TO HER THAT NIGHT I TOLD HER AS MILDLY AS I COULD WHAT HIS WRONG WAS AND WHAT MY OWN SHARE IN HIS INJURY I SAID HE WAS A MAN IN VERY COMMON LIFE BUT OF A MOST GENTLE AND UPRIGHT CHARACTER AND THAT I VENTURED TO EXPRESS A HOPE THAT SHE WOULD NOT REFUSE TO SEE HIM IN HIS HEAVY TROUBLE I MENTIONED TWO OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AS THE HOUR OF OUR COMING AND I SENT THE LETTER MYSELF BY THE FIRST COACH IN THE MORNING AT THE APPOINTED TIME WE STOOD AT THE DOORTHE DOOR OF THAT HOUSE WHERE I HAD BEEN A FEW DAYS SINCE SO HAPPY WHERE MY YOUTHFUL CONFIDENCE AND WARMTH OF HEART HAD BEEN YIELDED UP SO FREELY WHICH WAS CLOSED AGAINST ME HENCEFORTH WHICH WAS NOW A WASTE A RUIN NO LITTIMER

AS WE WENT IN FROM ANOTHER PART OF THE ROOM AND STOOD BEHIND HER CHAIR I SAW DIRECTLY IN HIS MOTHERS FACE THAT SHE KNEW FROM HIMSELF WHAT HE HAD DONE IT WAS VERY PALE AND BORE THE TRACES OF DEEPER EMOTION THAN MY LETTER ALONE WEAKENED BY THE DOUBTS HER FONDNESS WOULD HAVE RAISED UPON IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO CREATE I THOUGHT HER MORE LIKE HIM THAN EVER I HAD THOUGHT HER AND I FELT RATHER THAN SAW THAT THE RESEMBLANCE WAS NOT LOST ON MY COMPANION SHE SAT UPRIGHT IN HER ARMCHAIR WITH A STATELY IMMOVABLE PASSIONLESS AIR THAT IT SEEMED AS IF NOTHING COULD DISTURB SHE LOOKED VERY STEADFASTLY AT MR PEGGOTTY WHEN HE STOOD BEFORE HER AND HE LOOKED QUITE AS STEADFASTLY AT HER ROSA DARTLES KEEN GLANCE COMPREHENDED ALL OF US FOR SOME MOMENTS NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN SHE MOTIONED TO MR PEGGOTTY TO BE SEATED HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE I SHOULDNT FEEL IT NATRAL MAAM TO SIT DOWN IN THIS HOUSE ID SOONER STAND AND THIS WAS SUCCEEDED BY ANOTHER SILENCE WHICH SHE BROKE THUS I KNOW WITH DEEP

SPOKE WAS NOT DEVOID OF ALL EFFECT SHE STILL PRESERVED HER PROUD MANNER BUT THERE WAS A TOUCH OF SOFTNESS IN HER VOICE AS SHE ANSWERED I JUSTIFY NOTHING I MAKE NO COUNTERACCUSATIONS BUT I AM SORRY TO REPEAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE SUCH A MARRIAGE WOULD IRRETRIEVABLY BLIGHT MY SONS CAREER AND RUIN HIS PROSPECTS NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT IT NEVER CAN TAKE PLACE AND NEVER WILL IF THERE IS ANY OTHER COMPENSATION I AM LOOKING AT THE LIKENESS OF THE FACE INTERRUPTED MR PEGGOTTY WITH A STEADY BUT A KINDLING EYE THAT HAS LOOKED AT ME IN MY HOME AT MY FIRESIDE IN MY BOATWHEER NOTSMILING AND FRIENDLY WHEN IT WAS SO TREACHEROUS THAT I GO HALF WILD WHEN I THINK OF IT IF THE LIKENESS OF THAT FACE DONT TURN TO BURNING FIRE AT THE THOUGHT OF OFFERING MONEY TO ME FOR MY CHILDS BLIGHT AND RUIN ITS AS BAD I DOENT KNOW BEING A LADYS BUT WHAT ITS WORSE SHE CHANGED NOW IN A MOMENT AN ANGRY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FEATURES AND SHE SAID IN AN INTOLERANT MANNER GRASPING THE ARMCHAIR TIGHTLY WITH HER HANDS WHAT COMPENSATION CAN YOU MAKE TO ME FOR OPENING SUCH A PIT BETWEEN ME AND MY SON WHAT IS YOUR LOVE TO MINE WHAT IS YOUR SEPARATION TO OURS MISS DARTLE SOFTLY TOUCHED HER AND BENT DOWN HER HEAD TO WHISPER BUT SHE WOULD NOT HEAR A WORD NO ROSA NOT A WORD LET THE MAN LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY MY SON WHO HAS BEEN THE OBJECT OF MY LIFE TO WHOM ITS EVERY THOUGHT HAS BEEN DEVOTED WHOM I HAVE GRATIFIED FROM A CHILD IN EVERY WISH FROM WHOM I HAVE HAD NO SEPARATE EXISTENCE SINCE HIS BIRTHTO TAKE UP IN A MOMENT WITH A MISERABLE GIRL AND AVOID ME TO REPAY MY CONFIDENCE WITH SYSTEMATIC DECEPTION FOR HER SAKE AND QUIT ME FOR HER TO SET THIS WRETCHED FANCY AGAINST HIS MOTHERS CLAIMS UPON HIS DUTY LOVE RESPECT GRATITUDECLAIMS THAT EVERY DAY AND HOUR OF HIS LIFE SHOULD HAVE STRENGTHENED INTO TIES THAT NOTHING COULD BE PROOF AGAINST IS THIS NO INJURY AGAIN ROSA DARTLE TRIED TO SOOTHE HER AGAIN INEFFECTUALLY I SAY ROSA NOT A WORD IF HE CAN STAKE HIS ALL UPON THE LIGHTEST OBJECT I CAN STAKE MY ALL UPON A GREATER PURPOSE LET HIM GO WHERE HE WILL WITH THE MEANS THAT MY LOVE HAS SECURED TO HIM DOES HE THINK TO REDUCE ME BY LONG ABSENCE HE KNOWS HIS MOTHER VERY LITTLE IF HE DOES LET HIM PUT AWAY HIS WHIM NOW AND HE IS WELCOME BACK LET HIM NOT PUT HER AWAY NOW AND HE NEVER SHALL COME NEAR ME LIVING OR DYING WHILE I CAN RAISE MY HAND TO MAKE A SIGN AGAINST IT UNLESS BEING RID OF HER FOR EVER HE COMES HUMBLY TO ME AND BEGS FOR MY FORGIVENESS THIS IS MY RIGHT THIS IS THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT I WILL HAVE THIS IS THE SEPARATION THAT THERE IS BETWEEN US AND IS THIS SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HER VISITOR WITH THE PROUD INTOLERANT AIR WITH WHICH SHE HAD BEGUN NO INJURY WHILE I HEARD AND SAW THE MOTHER AS SHE SAID THESE WORDS I SEEMED TO HEAR AND SEE THE SON DEFYING THEM ALL THAT I HAD EVER SEEN IN HIM OF AN UNYIELDING WILFUL SPIRIT I SAW IN HER ALL THE UNDERSTANDING THAT I HAD NOW OF HIS MISDIRECTED ENERGY BECAME AN UNDERSTANDING OF HER CHARACTER TOO AND A PERCEPTION THAT IT WAS IN ITS STRONGEST SPRINGS THE SAME SHE NOW OBSERVED TO ME ALOUD RESUMING HER FORMER RESTRAINT THAT IT WAS USELESS TO HEAR MORE OR TO SAY MORE AND THAT SHE BEGGED TO PUT AN END TO THE INTERVIEW SHE ROSE WITH AN AIR OF DIGNITY TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHEN MR PEGGOTTY SIGNIFIED THAT IT WAS NEEDLESS DOENT FEAR ME BEING ANY HINDRANCE TO YOU I HAVE NO MORE TO SAY MAAM HE REMARKED AS HE MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR I COME HEER WITH NO HOPE AND I TAKE AWAY NO HOPE I HAVE DONE WHAT I THOWT SHOULD BE DONE BUT I NEVER LOOKED FUR ANY GOOD TO COME OF MY STANNING WHERE I DO THIS HAS BEEN TOO EVIL A HOUSE FUR ME AND MINE FUR ME TO BE IN MY RIGHT SENSES AND EXPECT IT WITH THIS WE DEPARTED LEAVING HER STANDING BY HER ELBOWCHAIR A PICTURE OF A NOBLE PRESENCE AND A HANDSOME FACE WE HAD ON OUR WAY OUT TO CROSS A PAVED HALL WITH GLASS SIDES AND ROOF OVER WHICH A VINE WAS TRAINED ITS LEAVES AND SHOOTS WERE GREEN THEN AND THE DAY BEING SUNNY A PAIR OF GLASS DOORS LEADING TO THE GARDEN WERE THROWN OPEN ROSA DARTLE ENTERING THIS WAY WITH A NOISELESS STEP WHEN WE WERE CLOSE TO THEM ADDRESSED HERSELF TO ME YOU DO WELL SHE SAID INDEED TO BRING THIS FELLOW HERE SUCH A CONCENTRATION OF RAGE AND SCORN AS DARKENED HER FACE AND FLASHED IN HER JETBLACK EYES I COULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT COMPRESSIBLE EVEN INTO THAT FACE THE SCAR MADE BY THE HAMMER WAS AS USUAL IN THIS EXCITED STATE OF HER FEATURES STRONGLY MARKED WHEN THE THROBBING I HAD SEEN BEFORE CAME INTO IT AS I LOOKED AT HER SHE ABSOLUTELY LIFTED UP HER HAND AND STRUCK IT THIS IS A FELLOW SHE SAID TO CHAMPION AND BRING HERE IS HE NOT YOU ARE A TRUE MAN MISS DARTLE I RETURNED YOU ARE SURELY NOT SO UNJUST AS TO CONDEMN ME WHY DO YOU BRING DIVISION BETWEEN THESE TWO MAD CREATURES SHE RETURNED DONT YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE BOTH MAD WITH THEIR OWN SELFWILL AND PRIDE IS IT MY DOING I RETURNED IS IT YOUR DOING SHE RETORTED WHY DO YOU BRING THIS MAN HERE HE IS A DEEPLYINJURED MAN MISS DARTLE I REPLIED YOU MAY NOT KNOW IT I KNOW THAT JAMES STEERFORTH SHE SAID WITH HER HAND ON HER BOSOM AS IF TO PREVENT THE STORM THAT WAS RAGING THERE FROM BEING LOUD HAS A FALSE CORRUPT HEART AND IS A TRAITOR BUT WHAT NEED I KNOW OR CARE ABOUT THIS FELLOW AND HIS COMMON NIECE MISS DARTLE I RETURNED YOU DEEPEN THE INJURY IT IS SUFFICIENT ALREADY I WILL ONLY SAY AT PARTING THAT YOU DO HIM A GREAT WRONG I DO HIM NO WRONG SHE RETURNED THEY ARE A DEPRAVED WORTHLESS SET I WOULD HAVE HER WHIPPED MR PEGGOTTY PASSED ON WITHOUT A WORD AND WENT OUT AT THE DOOR OH SHAME MISS DARTLE SHAME I SAID INDIGNANTLY HOW CAN YOU BEAR TO TRAMPLE ON HIS UNDESERVED AFFLICTION I WOULD TRAMPLE ON THEM ALL SHE ANSWERED I WOULD HAVE HIS HOUSE PULLED DOWN I WOULD HAVE HER BRANDED ON THE FACE DRESSED IN RAGS AND CAST OUT IN THE STREETS TO STARVE IF I HAD THE POWER TO SIT IN JUDGEMENT ON HER I WOULD SEE IT DONE SEE IT DONE I WOULD DO IT I DETEST HER IF I EVER COULD REPROACH HER WITH HER INFAMOUS CONDITION I WOULD GO ANYWHERE TO DO SO IF I COULD HUNT HER TO HER GRAVE I WOULD IF THERE WAS ANY WORD OF COMFORT THAT WOULD BE A SOLACE TO HER IN HER DYING HOUR AND ONLY I POSSESSED IT I WOULDNT PART WITH IT FOR LIFE ITSELF THE MERE VEHEMENCE OF HER WORDS CAN CONVEY I AM SENSIBLE BUT A WEAK IMPRESSION OF THE PASSION BY WHICH SHE WAS POSSESSED AND WHICH MADE ITSELF ARTICULATE IN HER WHOLE FIGURE THOUGH HER VOICE INSTEAD OF BEING RAISED WAS LOWER THAN USUAL NO DESCRIPTION I COULD GIVE OF HER WOULD DO JUSTICE TO MY RECOLLECTION OF HER OR TO HER ENTIRE DELIVERANCE OF HERSELF TO HER ANGER I HAVE SEEN PASSION IN MANY FORMS BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IN SUCH A FORM AS THAT WHEN I JOINED MR PEGGOTTY HE WAS WALKING SLOWLY AND THOUGHTFULLY DOWN THE HILL HE TOLD ME AS SOON AS I CAME UP WITH HIM THAT HAVING NOW DISCHARGED HIS MIND OF WHAT HE HAD PURPOSED DOING IN LONDON HE MEANT TO SET OUT ON HIS TRAVELS THAT NIGHT I ASKED HIM WHERE HE MEANT TO GO HE ONLY ANSWERED IM A GOING SIR TO SEEK MY NIECE WE WENT BACK TO THE LITTLE LODGING OVER THE CHANDLERS SHOP AND THERE I FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY OF REPEATING TO PEGGOTTY WHAT HE HAD SAID TO ME SHE INFORMED ME IN RETURN THAT HE HAD SAID THE SAME TO HER THAT MORNING SHE KNEW NO MORE THAN I DID WHERE HE WAS GOING BUT SHE THOUGHT HE HAD SOME PROJECT SHAPED OUT IN HIS MIND I DID NOT LIKE TO LEAVE HIM UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE ALL THREE DINED TOGETHER OFF A BEEFSTEAK PIEWHICH WAS ONE OF THE MANY GOOD THINGS FOR WHICH PEGGOTTY WAS FAMOUSAND WHICH WAS CURIOUSLY FLAVOURED ON THIS OCCASION I RECOLLECT WELL BY A MISCELLANEOUS TASTE OF TEA COFFEE BUTTER BACON CHEESE NEW LOAVES FIREWOOD CANDLES AND WALNUT KETCHUP CONTINUALLY ASCENDING FROM THE SHOP AFTER DINNER WE SAT FOR AN HOUR OR SO NEAR THE WINDOW WITHOUT TALKING MUCH AND THEN MR PEGGOTTY GOT UP AND BROUGHT HIS OILSKIN BAG AND HIS STOUT STICK AND LAID THEM ON THE TABLE HE ACCEPTED FROM HIS SISTERS STOCK OF READY MONEY A SMALL SUM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LEGACY BARELY ENOUGH I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO KEEP HIM FOR A MONTH HE PROMISED TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME WHEN ANYTHING BEFELL HIM AND HE SLUNG HIS BAG ABOUT HIM TOOK HIS HAT AND STICK AND BADE US BOTH GOODBYE ALL GOOD ATTEND YOU DEAR OLD WOMAN HE SAID EMBRACING PEGGOTTY AND YOU TOO MASR DAVY SHAKING HANDS WITH ME IM AGOING TO SEEK HER FUR AND WIDE IF SHE SHOULD COME HOME WHILE IM AWAYBUT AH THAT AINT LIKE TO BEOR IF I SHOULD BRING HER BACK MY MEANING IS THAT SHE AND ME SHALL LIVE AND DIE WHERE NO ONE CANT REPROACH HER IF ANY HURT SHOULD COME TO ME REMEMBER THAT THE LAST WORDS I LEFT FOR HER WAS MY UNCHANGED LOVE IS WITH MY DARLING CHILD AND I FORGIVE HER HE SAID THIS SOLEMNLY BAREHEADED THEN PUTTING ON HIS HAT HE WENT DOWN THE STAIRS AND AWAY WE FOLLOWED TO THE DOOR IT WAS A WARM DUSTY EVENING JUST THE TIME WHEN IN THE GREAT MAIN THOROUGHFARE OUT OF WHICH THAT BYWAY TURNED THERE WAS A TEMPORARY LULL IN THE ETERNAL TREAD OF FEET UPON THE PAVEMENT AND A STRONG RED SUNSHINE HE TURNED ALONE AT THE CORNER OF OUR SHADY STREET INTO A GLOW OF LIGHT IN WHICH WE LOST HIM RARELY DID THAT HOUR OF THE EVENING COME RARELY DID I WAKE AT NIGHT RARELY DID I LOOK UP AT THE MOON OR STARS OR WATCH THE FALLING RAIN OR HEAR THE WIND BUT I THOUGHT OF HIS SOLITARY FIGURE TOILING ON POOR PILGRIM AND RECALLED THE WORDS IM A GOING TO SEEK HER FUR AND WIDE IF ANY HURT SHOULD COME TO ME REMEMBER THAT THE LAST WORDS I LEFT FOR HER WAS MY UNCHANGED LOVE IS WITH MY DARLING CHILD AND I FORGIVE HER CHAPTER BLISSFUL ALL THIS TIME I HAD GONE ON LOVING DORA HARDER THAN EVER HER IDEA WAS MY REFUGE IN DISAPPOINTMENT AND DISTRESS AND MADE SOME AMENDS TO ME EVEN FOR THE LOSS OF MY FRIEND THE MORE I PITIED MYSELF OR PITIED OTHERS THE MORE I SOUGHT FOR CONSOLATION IN THE IMAGE OF DORA THE GREATER THE ACCUMULATION OF DECEIT AND TROUBLE IN THE WORLD THE BRIGHTER AND THE PURER SHONE THE STAR OF DORA HIGH ABOVE THE WORLD I DONT THINK I HAD ANY DEFINITE IDEA WHERE DORA CAME FROM OR IN WHAT DEGREE SHE WAS RELATED TO A HIGHER ORDER OF BEINGS BUT I AM QUITE SURE I SHOULD HAVE SCOUTED THE NOTION OF HER BEING SIMPLY HUMAN LIKE ANY OTHER YOUNG LADY WITH INDIGNATION AND CONTEMPT IF I MAY SO EXPRESS IT I WAS STEEPED IN DORA I WAS NOT MERELY OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH HER BUT I WAS SATURATED THROUGH AND THROUGH ENOUGH LOVE MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRUNG OUT OF ME METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING TO DROWN ANYBODY IN AND YET THERE WOULD HAVE REMAINED ENOUGH WITHIN ME AND ALL OVER ME TO PERVADE MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE THE FIRST THING I DID ON MY OWN ACCOUNT WHEN I CAME BACK WAS TO TAKE A NIGHTWALK TO NORWOOD AND LIKE THE SUBJECT OF A VENERABLE RIDDLE OF MY CHILDHOOD TO GO ROUND AND ROUND THE HOUSE WITHOUT EVER TOUCHING THE HOUSE THINKING ABOUT DORA I BELIEVE THE THEME OF THIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE CONUNDRUM WAS THE MOON NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS I THE MOONSTRUCK SLAVE OF DORA PERAMBULATED ROUND AND ROUND THE HOUSE AND GARDEN FOR TWO HOURS LOOKING THROUGH CREVICES IN THE PALINGS GETTING MY CHIN BY DINT OF VIOLENT EXERTION ABOVE THE RUSTY NAILS ON THE TOP BLOWING KISSES AT THE LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS AND ROMANTICALLY CALLING ON THE NIGHT AT INTERVALS TO SHIELD MY DORAI DONT EXACTLY KNOW WHAT FROM I SUPPOSE FROM FIRE PERHAPS FROM MICE TO WHICH SHE HAD A GREAT OBJECTION MY LOVE WAS SO MUCH IN MY MIND AND IT WAS SO NATURAL TO ME TO CONFIDE IN PEGGOTTY WHEN I FOUND HER AGAIN BY MY SIDE OF AN EVENING WITH THE OLD SET OF INDUSTRIAL IMPLEMENTS BUSILY MAKING THE TOUR OF MY WARDROBE THAT I IMPARTED TO HER IN A SUFFICIENTLY ROUNDABOUT WAY MY GREAT SECRET PEGGOTTY WAS STRONGLY INTERESTED BUT I COULD NOT GET HER INTO MY VIEW OF THE CASE AT ALL SHE WAS AUDACIOUSLY PREJUDICED IN MY FAVOUR AND QUITE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY I SHOULD HAVE ANY MISGIVINGS OR BE LOWSPIRITED ABOUT IT THE YOUNG LADY MIGHT THINK HERSELF WELL OFF SHE OBSERVED TO HAVE SUCH A BEAU AND AS TO HER PA SHE SAID WHAT DID THE GENTLEMAN EXPECT FOR GRACIOUS SAKE I OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT MR SPENLOWS PROCTORIAL GOWN AND STIFF CRAVAT TOOK PEGGOTTY DOWN A LITTLE AND INSPIRED HER WITH A GREATER REVERENCE FOR THE MAN WHO WAS GRADUALLY BECOMING MORE AND MORE ETHEREALIZED IN MY EYES EVERY DAY AND ABOUT WHOM A REFLECTED RADIANCE SEEMED TO ME TO BEAM WHEN HE SAT ERECT IN COURT AMONG HIS PAPERS LIKE A LITTLE LIGHTHOUSE IN A SEA OF STATIONERY AND BY THE BY IT USED TO BE UNCOMMONLY STRANGE TO ME TO CONSIDER I REMEMBER AS I SAT IN COURT TOO HOW THOSE DIM OLD JUDGES AND DOCTORS WOULDNT HAVE CARED FOR DORA IF THEY HAD KNOWN HER HOW THEY WOULDNT HAVE GONE OUT OF THEIR SENSES WITH RAPTURE IF MARRIAGE WITH DORA HAD BEEN PROPOSED TO THEM HOW DORA MIGHT HAVE SUNG AND PLAYED UPON THAT GLORIFIED GUITAR UNTIL SHE LED ME TO THE VERGE OF MADNESS YET NOT HAVE TEMPTED ONE OF THOSE SLOWGOERS AN INCH OUT OF HIS ROAD I DESPISED THEM TO A MAN FROZENOUT OLD GARDENERS IN THE FLOWERBEDS OF THE HEART I TOOK A PERSONAL OFFENCE AGAINST THEM ALL THE BENCH WAS NOTHING TO ME BUT AN INSENSIBLE BLUNDERER THE BAR HAD NO MORE TENDERNESS OR POETRY IN IT THAN THE BAR OF A PUBLICHOUSE TAKING THE MANAGEMENT OF PEGGOTTYS AFFAIRS INTO MY OWN HANDS WITH NO LITTLE PRIDE I PROVED THE WILL AND CAME TO A SETTLEMENT WITH THE LEGACY DUTYOFFICE AND TOOK HER TO THE BANK AND SOON GOT EVERYTHING INTO AN ORDERLY TRAIN WE VARIED THE LEGAL CHARACTER OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BY GOING TO SEE SOME PERSPIRING WAXWORK IN FLEET STREET MELTED I SHOULD HOPE THESE TWENTY YEARS AND BY VISITING MISS LINWOODS EXHIBITION WHICH I REMEMBER AS A MAUSOLEUM OF NEEDLEWORK FAVOURABLE TO SELFEXAMINATION AND REPENTANCE AND BY INSPECTING THE TOWER OF LONDON AND GOING TO THE TOP OF ST PAULS ALL THESE WONDERS AFFORDED PEGGOTTY AS MUCH PLEASURE AS SHE WAS ABLE TO ENJOY UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEPT I THINK ST PAULS WHICH FROM HER LONG ATTACHMENT TO HER WORKBOX BECAME A RIVAL OF THE PICTURE ON THE LID AND WAS IN SOME PARTICULARS VANQUISHED SHE CONSIDERED BY THAT WORK OF ART PEGGOTTYS BUSINESS WHICH WAS WHAT WE USED TO CALL COMMONFORM BUSINESS IN THE COMMONS AND VERY LIGHT AND LUCRATIVE THE COMMONFORM BUSINESS WAS BEING SETTLED I TOOK HER DOWN TO THE OFFICE ONE MORNING TO PAY HER BILL MR SPENLOW HAD STEPPED OUT OLD TIFFEY SAID TO GET A GENTLEMAN SWORN FOR A MARRIAGE LICENCE BUT AS I KNEW HE WOULD BE BACK DIRECTLY OUR PLACE LYING CLOSE TO THE SURROGATES AND TO THE VICARGENERALS OFFICE TOO I TOLD PEGGOTTY TO WAIT WE WERE A LITTLE LIKE UNDERTAKERS IN THE COMMONS AS REGARDED PROBATE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY MAKING IT A RULE TO LOOK MORE OR LESS CUT UP WHEN WE HAD TO DEAL WITH CLIENTS IN MOURNING IN A SIMILAR FEELING OF DELICACY WE WERE ALWAYS BLITHE AND LIGHTHEARTED WITH THE LICENCE CLIENTS THEREFORE I HINTED TO PEGGOTTY THAT SHE WOULD FIND MR SPENLOW MUCH RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK OF MR BARKISS DECEASE AND INDEED HE CAME IN LIKE A BRIDEGROOM BUT NEITHER PEGGOTTY NOR I HAD EYES FOR HIM WHEN WE SAW IN COMPANY WITH HIM MR MURDSTONE HE WAS VERY LITTLE CHANGED HIS HAIR LOOKED AS THICK AND WAS CERTAINLY AS BLACK AS EVER AND HIS GLANCE WAS AS LITTLE TO BE TRUSTED AS OF OLD AH COPPERFIELD SAID MR SPENLOW YOU KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN I BELIEVE I MADE MY GENTLEMAN A DISTANT BOW AND PEGGOTTY BARELY RECOGNIZED HIM HE WAS AT FIRST SOMEWHAT DISCONCERTED TO MEET US TWO TOGETHER BUT QUICKLY DECIDED WHAT TO DO AND CAME UP TO ME I HOPE HE SAID THAT YOU ARE DOING WELL IT CAN HARDLY BE INTERESTING TO YOU SAID I YES IF YOU WISH TO KNOW WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO PEGGOTTY AND YOU SAID HE I AM SORRY TO OBSERVE THAT YOU HAVE LOST YOUR HUSBAND ITS NOT THE FIRST LOSS I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE MR MURDSTONE REPLIED PEGGOTTY TREMBLING FROM HEAD TO FOOT I AM GLAD TO HOPE THAT THERE IS NOBODY TO BLAME FOR THIS ONENOBODY TO ANSWER FOR IT HA SAID HE THATS A COMFORTABLE REFLECTION YOU HAVE DONE YOUR DUTY I HAVE NOT WORN ANYBODYS LIFE AWAY SAID PEGGOTTY I AM THANKFUL TO THINK NO MR MURDSTONE I HAVE NOT WORRITED AND FRIGHTENED ANY SWEET CREETUR TO AN EARLY GRAVE HE EYED HER GLOOMILYREMORSEFULLY I THOUGHTFOR AN INSTANT AND SAID TURNING HIS HEAD TOWARDS ME BUT LOOKING AT MY FEET INSTEAD OF MY FACE WE ARE NOT LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER SOON AGAINA SOURCE OF SATISFACTION TO US BOTH NO DOUBT FOR SUCH MEETINGS AS THIS CAN NEVER BE AGREEABLE I DO NOT EXPECT THAT YOU WHO ALWAYS REBELLED AGAINST MY JUST AUTHORITY EXERTED FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND REFORMATION SHOULD OWE ME ANY GOODWILL NOW THERE IS AN ANTIPATHY BETWEEN US AN OLD ONE I BELIEVE SAID I INTERRUPTING HIM HE SMILED AND SHOT AS EVIL A GLANCE AT ME AS COULD COME FROM HIS DARK EYES IT RANKLED IN YOUR BABY BREAST HE SAID IT EMBITTERED THE LIFE OF YOUR POOR MOTHER YOU ARE RIGHT I HOPE YOU MAY DO BETTER YET I HOPE YOU MAY CORRECT YOURSELF HERE HE ENDED THE DIALOGUE WHICH HAD BEEN CARRIED ON IN A LOW VOICE IN A CORNER OF THE OUTER OFFICE BY PASSING INTO MR SPENLOWS ROOM AND SAYING ALOUD IN HIS SMOOTHEST MANNER GENTLEMEN OF MR SPENLOWS PROFESSION ARE ACCUSTOMED TO FAMILY DIFFERENCES AND KNOW HOW COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT THEY ALWAYS ARE WITH THAT HE PAID THE MONEY FOR HIS LICENCE AND RECEIVING IT NEATLY FOLDED FROM MR SPENLOW TOGETHER WITH A SHAKE OF THE HAND AND A POLITE WISH FOR HIS HAPPINESS AND THE LADYS WENT OUT OF THE OFFICE I MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE DIFFICULTY IN CONSTRAINING MYSELF TO BE SILENT UNDER HIS WORDS IF I HAD HAD LESS DIFFICULTY IN IMPRESSING UPON PEGGOTTY WHO WAS ONLY ANGRY ON MY ACCOUNT GOOD CREATURE THAT WE WERE NOT IN A PLACE FOR RECRIMINATION AND THAT I BESOUGHT HER TO HOLD HER PEACE SHE WAS SO UNUSUALLY ROUSED THAT I WAS GLAD TO COMPOUND FOR AN AFFECTIONATE HUG ELICITED BY THIS REVIVAL IN HER MIND OF OUR OLD INJURIES AND TO MAKE THE BEST I COULD OF IT BEFORE MR SPENLOW AND THE CLERKS MR SPENLOW DID NOT APPEAR TO KNOW WHAT THE CONNEXION BETWEEN MR MURDSTONE AND MYSELF WAS WHICH I WAS GLAD OF FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM EVEN IN MY OWN BREAST REMEMBERING WHAT I DID OF THE HISTORY OF MY POOR MOTHER MR SPENLOW SEEMED TO THINK IF HE THOUGHT ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER THAT MY AUNT WAS THE LEADER OF THE STATE PARTY IN OUR FAMILY AND THAT THERE WAS A REBEL PARTY COMMANDED BY SOMEBODY ELSESO I GATHERED AT LEAST FROM WHAT HE SAID WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR MR TIFFEY TO MAKE OUT PEGGOTTYS BILL OF COSTS MISS TROTWOOD HE REMARKED IS VERY FIRM NO DOUBT AND NOT LIKELY TO GIVE WAY TO OPPOSITION I HAVE AN ADMIRATION FOR HER CHARACTER AND I MAY CONGRATULATE YOU COPPERFIELD ON BEING ON THE RIGHT SIDE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RELATIONS ARE MUCH TO BE DEPLOREDBUT THEY ARE EXTREMELY GENERALAND THE GREAT THING IS TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE MEANING I TAKE IT ON THE SIDE OF THE MONEYED INTEREST RATHER A GOOD MARRIAGE THIS I BELIEVE SAID MR SPENLOW I EXPLAINED THAT I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT INDEED HE SAID SPEAKING FROM THE FEW WORDS MR MURDSTONE DROPPEDAS A MAN FREQUENTLY DOES ON THESE OCCASIONSAND FROM WHAT MISS MURDSTONE LET FALL I SHOULD SAY IT WAS RATHER A GOOD MARRIAGE DO YOU MEAN THAT THERE IS MONEY SIR I ASKED YES SAID MR SPENLOW I UNDERSTAND THERES MONEY BEAUTY TOO I AM TOLD INDEED IS HIS NEW WIFE YOUNG JUST OF AGE SAID MR SPENLOW SO LATELY THAT I SHOULD THINK THEY HAD BEEN WAITING FOR THAT LORD DELIVER HER SAID PEGGOTTY SO VERY EMPHATICALLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY THAT WE WERE ALL THREE DISCOMPOSED UNTIL TIFFEY CAME IN WITH THE BILL OLD TIFFEY SOON APPEARED HOWEVER AND HANDED IT TO MR SPENLOW TO LOOK OVER MR SPENLOW SETTLING HIS CHIN IN HIS CRAVAT AND RUBBING IT SOFTLY WENT OVER THE ITEMS WITH A DEPRECATORY AIRAS IF IT WERE ALL JORKINSS DOINGAND HANDED IT BACK TO TIFFEY WITH A BLAND SIGH YES HE SAID THATS RIGHT QUITE RIGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY HAPPY COPPERFIELD TO HAVE LIMITED THESE CHARGES TO THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURE OUT OF POCKET BUT IT IS AN IRKSOME INCIDENT IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE THAT I AM NOT AT LIBERTY TO CONSULT MY OWN WISHES I HAVE A PARTNERMR JORKINS AS HE SAID THIS WITH A GENTLE MELANCHOLY WHICH WAS THE NEXT THING TO MAKING NO CHARGE AT ALL I EXPRESSED MY ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ON PEGGOTTYS BEHALF AND PAID TIFFEY IN BANKNOTES PEGGOTTY THEN RETIRED TO HER LODGING AND MR SPENLOW AND I WENT INTO COURT WHERE WE HAD A DIVORCESUIT COMING ON UNDER AN INGENIOUS LITTLE STATUTE REPEALED NOW I BELIEVE BUT IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL MARRIAGES ANNULLED OF WHICH THE MERITS WERE THESE THE HUSBAND WHOSE NAME WAS THOMAS BENJAMIN HAD TAKEN OUT HIS MARRIAGE LICENCE AS THOMAS ONLY SUPPRESSING THE BENJAMIN IN CASE HE SHOULD NOT FIND HIMSELF AS COMFORTABLE AS HE EXPECTED NOT FINDING HIMSELF AS COMFORTABLE AS HE EXPECTED OR BEING A LITTLE FATIGUED WITH HIS WIFE POOR FELLOW HE NOW CAME FORWARD BY A FRIEND AFTER BEING MARRIED A YEAR OR TWO AND DECLARED THAT HIS NAME WAS THOMAS BENJAMIN AND THEREFORE HE WAS NOT MARRIED AT ALL WHICH THE COURT CONFIRMED TO HIS GREAT SATISFACTION I MUST SAY THAT I HAD MY DOUBTS ABOUT THE STRICT JUSTICE OF THIS AND WAS NOT EVEN FRIGHTENED OUT OF THEM BY THE BUSHEL OF WHEAT WHICH RECONCILES ALL ANOMALIES BUT MR SPENLOW ARGUED THE MATTER WITH ME HE SAID LOOK AT THE WORLD THERE WAS GOOD AND EVIL IN THAT LOOK AT THE ECCLESIASTICAL LAW THERE WAS GOOD AND EVIL IN THAT IT WAS ALL PART OF A SYSTEM VERY GOOD THERE YOU WERE I HAD NOT THE HARDIHOOD TO SUGGEST TO DORAS FATHER THAT POSSIBLY WE MIGHT EVEN IMPROVE THE WORLD A LITTLE IF WE GOT UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND TOOK OFF OUR COATS TO THE WORK BUT I CONFESSED THAT I THOUGHT WE MIGHT IMPROVE THE COMMONS MR SPENLOW REPLIED THAT HE WOULD PARTICULARLY ADVISE ME TO DISMISS THAT IDEA FROM MY MIND AS NOT BEING WORTHY OF MY GENTLEMANLY CHARACTER BUT THAT HE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR FROM ME OF WHAT IMPROVEMENT I THOUGHT THE COMMONS SUSCEPTIBLE TAKING THAT PART OF THE COMMONS WHICH HAPPENED TO BE NEAREST TO USFOR OUR MAN WAS UNMARRIED BY THIS TIME AND WE WERE OUT OF COURT AND STROLLING PAST THE PREROGATIVE OFFICEI SUBMITTED THAT I THOUGHT THE PREROGATIVE OFFICE RATHER A QUEERLY MANAGED INSTITUTION MR SPENLOW INQUIRED IN WHAT RESPECT I REPLIED WITH ALL DUE DEFERENCE TO HIS EXPERIENCE BUT WITH MORE DEFERENCE I AM AFRAID TO HIS BEING DORAS FATHER THAT PERHAPS IT WAS A LITTLE NONSENSICAL THAT THE REGISTRY OF THAT COURT CONTAINING THE ORIGINAL WILLS OF ALL PERSONS LEAVING EFFECTS WITHIN THE IMMENSE PROVINCE OF CANTERBURY FOR THREE WHOLE CENTURIES SHOULD BE AN ACCIDENTAL BUILDING NEVER DESIGNED FOR THE PURPOSE LEASED BY THE REGISTRARS FOR THEIR OWN PRIVATE EMOLUMENT UNSAFE NOT EVEN ASCERTAINED TO BE FIREPROOF CHOKED WITH THE IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IT HELD AND POSITIVELY FROM THE ROOF TO THE BASEMENT A MERCENARY SPECULATION OF THE REGISTRARS WHO TOOK GREAT FEES FROM THE PUBLIC AND CRAMMED THE PUBLICS WILLS AWAY ANYHOW AND ANYWHERE HAVING NO OTHER OBJECT THAN TO GET RID OF THEM CHEAPLY THAT PERHAPS IT WAS A LITTLE UNREASONABLE THAT THESE REGISTRARS IN THE RECEIPT OF PROFITS AMOUNTING TO EIGHT OR NINE THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR TO SAY NOTHING OF THE PROFITS OF THE DEPUTY REGISTRARS AND CLERKS OF SEATS SHOULD NOT BE OBLIGED TO SPEND A LITTLE OF THAT MONEY IN FINDING A REASONABLY SAFE PLACE FOR THE IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS WHICH ALL CLASSES OF PEOPLE WERE COMPELLED TO HAND OVER TO THEM WHETHER THEY WOULD OR NO THAT PERHAPS IT WAS A LITTLE UNJUST THAT ALL THE GREAT OFFICES IN THIS GREAT OFFICE SHOULD BE MAGNIFICENT SINECURES WHILE THE UNFORTUNATE WORKINGCLERKS IN THE COLD DARK ROOM UPSTAIRS WERE THE WORST REWARDED AND THE LEAST CONSIDERED MEN DOING IMPORTANT SERVICES IN LONDON THAT PERHAPS IT WAS A LITTLE INDECENT THAT THE PRINCIPAL REGISTRAR OF ALL WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO FIND THE PUBLIC CONSTANTLY RESORTING TO THIS PLACE ALL NEEDFUL ACCOMMODATION SHOULD BE AN ENORMOUS SINECURIST IN VIRTUE OF THAT POST AND MIGHT BE BESIDES A CLERGYMAN A PLURALIST THE HOLDER OF A STAFF IN A CATHEDRAL AND WHAT NOTWHILE THE PUBLIC WAS PUT TO THE INCONVENIENCE OF WHICH WE HAD A SPECIMEN EVERY AFTERNOON WHEN THE OFFICE WAS BUSY AND WHICH WE KNEW TO BE QUITE MONSTROUS THAT PERHAPS IN SHORT THIS PREROGATIVE OFFICE OF THE DIOCESE OF CANTERBURY WAS ALTOGETHER SUCH A PESTILENT JOB AND SUCH A PERNICIOUS ABSURDITY THAT BUT FOR ITS BEING SQUEEZED AWAY IN A CORNER OF ST PAULS CHURCHYARD WHICH FEW PEOPLE KNEW IT MUST HAVE BEEN TURNED COMPLETELY INSIDE OUT AND UPSIDE DOWN LONG AGO MR SPENLOW SMILED AS I BECAME MODESTLY WARM ON THE SUBJECT AND THEN ARGUED THIS QUESTION WITH ME AS HE HAD ARGUED THE OTHER HE SAID WHAT WAS IT AFTER ALL IT WAS A QUESTION OF FEELING IF THE PUBLIC FELT THAT THEIR WILLS WERE IN SAFE KEEPING AND TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE OFFICE WAS NOT TO BE MADE BETTER WHO WAS THE WORSE FOR IT NOBODY WHO WAS THE BETTER FOR IT ALL THE SINECURISTS VERY WELL THEN THE GOOD PREDOMINATED IT MIGHT NOT BE A PERFECT SYSTEM NOTHING WAS PERFECT BUT WHAT HE OBJECTED TO WAS THE INSERTION OF THE WEDGE UNDER THE PREROGATIVE OFFICE THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN GLORIOUS INSERT THE WEDGE INTO THE PREROGATIVE OFFICE AND THE COUNTRY WOULD CEASE TO BE GLORIOUS HE CONSIDERED IT THE PRINCIPLE OF A GENTLEMAN TO TAKE THINGS AS HE FOUND THEM AND HE HAD NO DOUBT THE PREROGATIVE OFFICE WOULD LAST OUR TIME I DEFERRED TO HIS OPINION THOUGH I HAD GREAT DOUBTS OF IT MYSELF I FIND HE WAS RIGHT HOWEVER FOR IT HAS NOT ONLY LASTED TO THE PRESENT MOMENT BUT HAS DONE SO IN THE TEETH OF A GREAT PARLIAMENTARY REPORT MADE NOT TOO WILLINGLY EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN ALL THESE OBJECTIONS OF MINE WERE SET FORTH IN DETAIL AND WHEN THE EXISTING STOWAGE FOR WILLS WAS DESCRIBED AS EQUAL TO THE ACCUMULATION OF ONLY TWO YEARS AND A HALF MORE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE WITH THEM SINCE WHETHER THEY HAVE LOST MANY OR WHETHER THEY SELL ANY NOW AND THEN TO THE BUTTER SHOPS I DONT KNOW I AM GLAD MINE IS NOT THERE AND I HOPE IT MAY NOT GO THERE YET AWHILE I HAVE SET ALL THIS DOWN IN MY PRESENT BLISSFUL CHAPTER BECAUSE HERE IT COMES INTO ITS NATURAL PLACE MR SPENLOW AND I FALLING INTO THIS CONVERSATION PROLONGED IT AND OUR SAUNTER TO AND FRO UNTIL WE DIVERGED INTO GENERAL TOPICS AND SO IT CAME ABOUT IN THE END THAT MR SPENLOW TOLD ME THIS DAY WEEK WAS DORAS BIRTHDAY AND HE WOULD BE GLAD IF I WOULD COME DOWN AND JOIN A LITTLE PICNIC ON THE OCCASION I WENT OUT OF MY SENSES IMMEDIATELY BECAME A MERE DRIVELLER NEXT DAY ON RECEIPT OF A LITTLE LACEEDGED SHEET OF NOTEPAPER FAVOURED BY PAPA TO REMIND AND PASSED THE INTERVENING PERIOD IN A STATE OF DOTAGE I THINK I COMMITTED EVERY POSSIBLE ABSURDITY IN THE WAY OF PREPARATION FOR THIS BLESSED EVENT I TURN HOT WHEN I REMEMBER THE CRAVAT I BOUGHT MY BOOTS MIGHT BE PLACED IN ANY COLLECTION OF INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE I PROVIDED AND SENT DOWN BY THE NORWOOD COACH THE NIGHT BEFORE A DELICATE LITTLE HAMPER AMOUNTING IN ITSELF I THOUGHT ALMOST TO A DECLARATION THERE WERE CRACKERS IN IT WITH THE TENDEREST MOTTOES THAT COULD BE GOT FOR MONEY AT SIX IN THE MORNING I WAS IN COVENT GARDEN MARKET BUYING A BOUQUET FOR DORA AT TEN I WAS ON HORSEBACK I HIRED A GALLANT GREY FOR THE OCCASION WITH THE BOUQUET IN MY HAT TO KEEP IT FRESH TROTTING DOWN TO NORWOOD I SUPPOSE THAT WHEN I SAW DORA IN THE GARDEN AND PRETENDED NOT TO SEE HER AND RODE PAST THE HOUSE PRETENDING TO BE ANXIOUSLY LOOKING FOR IT I COMMITTED TWO SMALL FOOLERIES WHICH OTHER YOUNG GENTLEMEN IN MY CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT HAVE COMMITTEDBECAUSE THEY CAME SO VERY NATURAL TO ME BUT OH WHEN I DID FIND THE HOUSE AND DID DISMOUNT AT THE GARDENGATE AND DRAG THOSE STONYHEARTED BOOTS ACROSS THE LAWN TO DORA SITTING ON A GARDENSEAT UNDER A LILAC TREE WHAT A SPECTACLE SHE WAS UPON THAT BEAUTIFUL MORNING AMONG THE BUTTERFLIES IN A WHITE CHIP BONNET AND A DRESS OF CELESTIAL BLUE THERE WAS A YOUNG LADY WITH HERCOMPARATIVELY STRICKEN IN YEARSALMOST TWENTY I SHOULD SAY HER NAME WAS MISS MILLS AND DORA CALLED HER JULIA SHE WAS THE BOSOM FRIEND OF DORA HAPPY MISS MILLS JIP WAS THERE AND JIP WOULD BARK AT ME AGAIN WHEN I PRESENTED MY BOUQUET HE GNASHED HIS TEETH WITH JEALOUSY WELL HE MIGHT IF HE HAD THE LEAST IDEA HOW I ADORED HIS MISTRESS WELL HE MIGHT OH THANK YOU MR COPPERFIELD WHAT DEAR FLOWERS SAID DORA I HAD HAD AN INTENTION OF SAYING AND HAD BEEN STUDYING THE BEST FORM OF WORDS FOR THREE MILES THAT I THOUGHT THEM BEAUTIFUL BEFORE I SAW THEM SO NEAR HER BUT I COULDNT MANAGE IT SHE WAS TOO BEWILDERING TO SEE HER LAY THE FLOWERS AGAINST HER LITTLE DIMPLED CHIN WAS TO LOSE ALL PRESENCE OF MIND AND POWER OF LANGUAGE IN A FEEBLE ECSTASY I WONDER I DIDNT SAY KILL ME IF YOU HAVE A HEART MISS MILLS LET ME DIE HERE THEN DORA HELD MY FLOWERS TO JIP TO SMELL THEN JIP GROWLED AND WOULDNT SMELL THEM THEN DORA LAUGHED AND HELD THEM A LITTLE CLOSER TO JIP TO MAKE HIM THEN JIP LAID HOLD OF A BIT OF GERANIUM WITH HIS TEETH AND WORRIED IMAGINARY CATS IN IT THEN DORA BEAT HIM AND POUTED AND SAID MY POOR BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AS COMPASSIONATELY I THOUGHT AS IF JIP HAD LAID HOLD OF ME I WISHED HE HAD YOULL BE SO GLAD TO HEAR MR COPPERFIELD SAID DORA THAT THAT CROSS MISS MURDSTONE IS NOT HERE SHE HAS GONE TO HER BROTHERS MARRIAGE AND WILL BE AWAY AT LEAST THREE WEEKS ISNT THAT DELIGHTFUL I SAID I WAS SURE IT MUST BE DELIGHTFUL TO HER AND ALL THAT WAS DELIGHTFUL TO HER WAS DELIGHTFUL TO ME MISS MILLS WITH AN AIR OF SUPERIOR WISDOM AND BENEVOLENCE SMILED UPON US SHE IS THE MOST DISAGREEABLE THING I EVER SAW SAID DORA YOU CANT BELIEVE HOW ILLTEMPERED AND SHOCKING SHE IS JULIA YES I CAN MY DEAR SAID JULIA YOU CAN PERHAPS LOVE RETURNED DORA WITH HER HAND ON JULIAS FORGIVE MY NOT EXCEPTING YOU MY DEAR AT FIRST I LEARNT FROM THIS THAT MISS MILLS HAD HAD HER TRIALS IN THE COURSE OF A CHEQUERED EXISTENCE AND THAT TO THESE PERHAPS I MIGHT REFER THAT WISE BENIGNITY OF MANNER WHICH I HAD ALREADY NOTICED I FOUND IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY THAT THIS WAS THE CASE MISS MILLS HAVING BEEN UNHAPPY IN A MISPLACED AFFECTION AND BEING UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE RETIRED FROM THE WORLD ON HER AWFUL STOCK OF EXPERIENCE BUT STILL TO TAKE A CALM INTEREST IN THE UNBLIGHTED HOPES AND LOVES OF YOUTH BUT NOW MR SPENLOW CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND DORA WENT TO HIM SAYING LOOK PAPA WHAT BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND MISS MILLS SMILED THOUGHTFULLY AS WHO SHOULD SAY YE MAYFLIES ENJOY YOUR BRIEF EXISTENCE IN THE BRIGHT MORNING OF LIFE AND WE ALL WALKED FROM THE LAWN TOWARDS THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS GETTING READY I SHALL NEVER HAVE SUCH A RIDE AGAIN I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH ANOTHER THERE WERE ONLY THOSE THREE THEIR HAMPER MY HAMPER AND THE GUITARCASE IN THE PHAETON AND OF COURSE THE PHAETON WAS OPEN AND I RODE BEHIND IT AND DORA SAT WITH HER BACK TO THE HORSES LOOKING TOWARDS ME SHE KEPT THE BOUQUET CLOSE TO HER ON THE CUSHION AND WOULDNT ALLOW JIP TO SIT ON THAT SIDE OF HER AT ALL FOR FEAR HE SHOULD CRUSH IT SHE OFTEN CARRIED IT IN HER HAND OFTEN REFRESHED HERSELF WITH ITS FRAGRANCE OUR EYES AT THOSE TIMES OFTEN MET AND MY GREAT ASTONISHMENT IS THAT I DIDNT GO OVER THE HEAD OF MY GALLANT GREY INTO THE CARRIAGE THERE WAS DUST I BELIEVE THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF DUST I BELIEVE I HAVE A FAINT IMPRESSION THAT MR SPENLOW REMONSTRATED WITH ME FOR RIDING IN IT BUT I KNEW OF NONE I WAS SENSIBLE OF A MIST OF LOVE AND BEAUTY ABOUT DORA BUT OF NOTHING ELSE HE STOOD UP SOMETIMES AND ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT OF THE PROSPECT I SAID IT WAS DELIGHTFUL AND I DARE SAY IT WAS BUT IT WAS ALL DORA TO ME THE SUN SHONE DORA AND THE BIRDS SANG DORA THE SOUTH WIND BLEW DORA AND THE WILD FLOWERS IN THE HEDGES WERE ALL DORAS TO A BUD MY COMFORT IS MISS MILLS UNDERSTOOD ME MISS MILLS ALONE COULD ENTER INTO MY FEELINGS THOROUGHLY I DONT KNOW HOW LONG WE WERE GOING AND TO THIS HOUR I KNOW AS LITTLE WHERE WE WENT PERHAPS IT WAS NEAR GUILDFORD PERHAPS SOME ARABIANNIGHT MAGICIAN OPENED UP THE PLACE FOR THE DAY AND SHUT IT UP FOR EVER WHEN WE CAME AWAY IT WAS A GREEN SPOT ON A HILL CARPETED WITH SOFT TURF THERE WERE SHADY TREES AND HEATHER AND AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE A RICH LANDSCAPE IT WAS A TRYING THING TO FIND PEOPLE HERE WAITING FOR US AND MY JEALOUSY EVEN OF THE LADIES KNEW NO BOUNDS BUT ALL OF MY OWN SEXESPECIALLY ONE IMPOSTOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS MY ELDER WITH A RED WHISKER ON WHICH HE ESTABLISHED AN AMOUNT OF PRESUMPTION NOT TO BE ENDUREDWERE MY MORTAL FOES WE ALL UNPACKED OUR BASKETS AND EMPLOYED OURSELVES IN GETTING DINNER READY RED WHISKER PRETENDED HE COULD MAKE A SALAD WHICH I DONT BELIEVE AND OBTRUDED HIMSELF ON PUBLIC NOTICE SOME OF THE YOUNG LADIES WASHED THE LETTUCES FOR HIM AND SLICED THEM UNDER HIS DIRECTIONS DORA WAS AMONG THESE I FELT THAT FATE HAD PITTED ME AGAINST THIS MAN AND ONE OF US MUST FALL RED WHISKER MADE HIS SALAD I WONDERED HOW THEY COULD EAT IT NOTHING SHOULD HAVE INDUCED ME TO TOUCH IT AND VOTED HIMSELF INTO THE CHARGE OF THE WINECELLAR WHICH HE CONSTRUCTED BEING AN INGENIOUS BEAST IN THE HOLLOW TRUNK OF A TREE BY AND BY I SAW HIM WITH THE MAJORITY OF A LOBSTER ON HIS PLATE EATING HIS DINNER AT THE FEET OF DORA I HAVE BUT AN INDISTINCT IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENED FOR SOME TIME AFTER THIS BALEFUL OBJECT PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY VIEW I WAS VERY MERRY I KNOW BUT IT WAS HOLLOW MERRIMENT I ATTACHED MYSELF TO A YOUNG CREATURE IN PINK WITH LITTLE EYES AND FLIRTED WITH HER DESPERATELY SHE RECEIVED MY ATTENTIONS WITH FAVOUR BUT WHETHER ON MY ACCOUNT SOLELY OR BECAUSE SHE HAD ANY DESIGNS ON RED WHISKER I CANT SAY DORAS HEALTH WAS DRUNK WHEN I DRANK IT I AFFECTED TO INTERRUPT MY CONVERSATION FOR THAT PURPOSE AND TO RESUME IT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS I CAUGHT DORAS EYE AS I BOWED TO HER AND I THOUGHT IT LOOKED APPEALING BUT IT LOOKED AT ME OVER THE HEAD OF RED WHISKER AND I WAS ADAMANT THE YOUNG CREATURE IN PINK HAD A MOTHER IN GREEN AND I RATHER THINK THE LATTER SEPARATED US FROM MOTIVES OF POLICY HOWBEIT THERE WAS A GENERAL BREAKING UP OF THE PARTY WHILE THE REMNANTS OF THE DINNER WERE BEING PUT AWAY AND I STROLLED OFF BY MYSELF AMONG THE TREES IN A RAGING AND REMORSEFUL STATE I WAS DEBATING WHETHER I SHOULD PRETEND THAT I WAS NOT WELL AND FLYI DONT KNOW WHEREUPON MY GALLANT GREY WHEN DORA AND MISS MILLS MET ME MR COPPERFIELD SAID MISS MILLS YOU ARE DULL I BEGGED HER PARDON NOT AT ALL AND DORA SAID MISS MILLS YOU ARE DULL OH DEAR NO NOT IN THE LEAST MR COPPERFIELD AND DORA SAID MISS MILLS WITH AN ALMOST VENERABLE AIR ENOUGH OF THIS DO NOT ALLOW A TRIVIAL MISUNDERSTANDING TO WITHER THE BLOSSOMS OF SPRING WHICH ONCE PUT FORTH AND BLIGHTED CANNOT BE RENEWED I SPEAK SAID MISS MILLS FROM EXPERIENCE OF THE PASTTHE REMOTE IRREVOCABLE PAST THE GUSHING FOUNTAINS WHICH SPARKLE IN THE SUN MUST NOT BE STOPPED IN MERE CAPRICE THE OASIS IN THE DESERT OF SAHARA MUST NOT BE PLUCKED UP IDLY I HARDLY KNEW WHAT I DID I WAS BURNING ALL OVER TO THAT EXTRAORDINARY EXTENT BUT I TOOK DORAS LITTLE HAND AND KISSED ITAND SHE LET ME I KISSED MISS MILLSS HAND AND WE ALL SEEMED TO MY THINKING TO GO STRAIGHT UP TO THE SEVENTH HEAVEN WE DID NOT COME DOWN AGAIN WE STAYED UP THERE ALL THE EVENING AT FIRST WE STRAYED TO AND FRO AMONG THE TREES I WITH DORAS SHY ARM DRAWN THROUGH MINE AND HEAVEN KNOWS FOLLY AS IT ALL WAS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HAPPY FATE TO HAVE BEEN STRUCK IMMORTAL WITH THOSE FOOLISH FEELINGS AND HAVE STAYED AMONG THE TREES FOR EVER BUT MUCH TOO SOON WE HEARD THE OTHERS LAUGHING AND TALKING AND CALLING WHERES DORA SO WE WENT BACK AND THEY WANTED DORA TO SING RED WHISKER WOULD HAVE GOT THE GUITARCASE OUT OF THE CARRIAGE BUT DORA TOLD HIM NOBODY KNEW WHERE IT WAS BUT I SO RED WHISKER WAS DONE FOR IN A MOMENT AND I GOT IT AND I UNLOCKED IT AND I TOOK THE GUITAR OUT AND I SAT BY HER AND I HELD HER HANDKERCHIEF AND GLOVES AND I DRANK IN EVERY NOTE OF HER DEAR VOICE AND SHE SANG TO ME WHO LOVED HER AND ALL THE OTHERS MIGHT APPLAUD AS MUCH AS THEY LIKED BUT THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT I WAS INTOXICATED WITH JOY I WAS AFRAID IT WAS TOO HAPPY TO BE REAL AND THAT I SHOULD WAKE IN BUCKINGHAM STREET PRESENTLY AND HEAR MRS CRUPP CLINKING THE TEACUPS IN GETTING BREAKFAST READY BUT DORA SANG AND OTHERS SANG AND MISS MILLS SANGABOUT THE SLUMBERING ECHOES IN THE CAVERNS OF MEMORY AS IF SHE WERE A HUNDRED YEARS OLDAND THE EVENING CAME ON AND WE HAD TEA WITH THE KETTLE BOILING GIPSYFASHION AND I WAS STILL AS HAPPY AS EVER I WAS HAPPIER THAN EVER WHEN THE PARTY BROKE UP AND THE OTHER PEOPLE DEFEATED RED WHISKER AND ALL WENT THEIR SEVERAL WAYS AND WE WENT OURS THROUGH THE STILL EVENING AND THE DYING LIGHT WITH SWEET SCENTS RISING UP AROUND US MR SPENLOW BEING A LITTLE DROWSY AFTER THE CHAMPAGNEHONOUR TO THE SOIL THAT GREW THE GRAPE TO THE GRAPE THAT MADE THE WINE TO THE SUN THAT RIPENED IT AND TO THE MERCHANT WHO ADULTERATED ITAND BEING FAST ASLEEP IN A CORNER OF THE CARRIAGE I RODE BY THE SIDE AND TALKED TO DORA SHE ADMIRED MY HORSE AND PATTED HIMOH WHAT A DEAR LITTLE HAND IT LOOKED UPON A HORSEAND HER SHAWL WOULD NOT KEEP RIGHT AND NOW AND THEN I DREW IT ROUND HER WITH MY ARM AND I EVEN FANCIED THAT JIP BEGAN TO SEE HOW IT WAS AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE MUST MAKE UP HIS MIND TO BE FRIENDS WITH ME THAT SAGACIOUS MISS MILLS TOO THAT AMIABLE THOUGH QUITE USED UP RECLUSE THAT LITTLE PATRIARCH OF SOMETHING LESS THAN TWENTY WHO HAD DONE WITH THE WORLD AND MUSTNT ON ANY ACCOUNT HAVE THE SLUMBERING ECHOES IN THE CAVERNS OF MEMORY AWAKENED WHAT A KIND THING SHE DID MR COPPERFIELD SAID MISS MILLS COME TO THIS SIDE OF THE CARRIAGE A MOMENTIF YOU CAN SPARE A MOMENT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU BEHOLD ME ON MY GALLANT GREY BENDING AT THE SIDE OF MISS MILLS WITH MY HAND UPON THE CARRIAGE DOOR DORA IS COMING TO STAY WITH ME SHE IS COMING HOME WITH ME THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CALL I AM SURE PAPA WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE YOU WHAT COULD I DO BUT INVOKE A SILENT BLESSING ON MISS MILLSS HEAD AND STORE MISS MILLSS ADDRESS IN THE SECUREST CORNER OF MY MEMORY WHAT COULD I DO BUT TELL MISS MILLS WITH GRATEFUL LOOKS AND FERVENT WORDS HOW MUCH I APPRECIATED HER GOOD OFFICES AND WHAT AN INESTIMABLE VALUE I SET UPON HER FRIENDSHIP THEN MISS MILLS BENIGNANTLY DISMISSED ME SAYING GO BACK TO DORA AND I WENT AND DORA LEANED OUT OF THE CARRIAGE TO TALK TO ME AND WE TALKED ALL THE REST OF THE WAY AND I RODE MY GALLANT GREY SO CLOSE TO THE WHEEL THAT I GRAZED HIS NEAR FORE LEG AGAINST IT AND TOOK THE BARK OFF AS HIS OWNER TOLD ME TO THE TUNE OF THREE PUN SIVINWHICH I PAID AND THOUGHT EXTREMELY CHEAP FOR SO MUCH JOY WHAT TIME MISS MILLS SAT LOOKING AT THE MOON MURMURING VERSESAND RECALLING I SUPPOSE THE ANCIENT DAYS WHEN SHE AND EARTH HAD ANYTHING IN COMMON NORWOOD WAS MANY MILES TOO NEAR AND WE REACHED IT MANY HOURS TOO SOON BUT MR SPENLOW CAME TO HIMSELF A LITTLE SHORT OF IT AND SAID YOU MUST COME IN COPPERFIELD AND REST AND I CONSENTING WE HAD SANDWICHES AND WINEANDWATER IN THE LIGHT ROOM DORA BLUSHING LOOKED SO LOVELY THAT I COULD NOT TEAR MYSELF AWAY BUT SAT THERE STARING IN A DREAM UNTIL THE SNORING OF MR SPENLOW INSPIRED ME WITH SUFFICIENT CONSCIOUSNESS TO TAKE MY LEAVE SO WE PARTED I RIDING ALL THE WAY TO LONDON WITH THE FAREWELL TOUCH OF DORAS HAND STILL LIGHT ON MINE RECALLING EVERY INCIDENT AND WORD TEN THOUSAND TIMES LYING DOWN IN MY OWN BED AT LAST AS ENRAPTURED A YOUNG NOODLE AS EVER WAS CARRIED OUT OF HIS FIVE WITS BY LOVE WHEN I AWOKE NEXT MORNING I WAS RESOLUTE TO DECLARE MY PASSION TO DORA AND KNOW MY FATE HAPPINESS OR MISERY WAS NOW THE QUESTION THERE WAS NO OTHER QUESTION THAT I KNEW OF IN THE WORLD AND ONLY DORA COULD GIVE THE ANSWER TO IT I PASSED THREE DAYS IN A LUXURY OF WRETCHEDNESS TORTURING MYSELF BY PUTTING EVERY CONCEIVABLE VARIETY OF DISCOURAGING CONSTRUCTION ON ALL THAT EVER HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN DORA AND ME AT LAST ARRAYED FOR THE PURPOSE AT A VAST EXPENSE I WENT TO MISS MILLSS FRAUGHT WITH A DECLARATION HOW MANY TIMES I WENT UP AND DOWN THE STREET AND ROUND THE SQUAREPAINFULLY AWARE OF BEING A MUCH BETTER ANSWER TO THE OLD RIDDLE THAN THE ORIGINAL ONEBEFORE I COULD PERSUADE MYSELF TO GO UP THE STEPS AND KNOCK IS NO MATTER NOW EVEN WHEN AT LAST I HAD KNOCKED AND WAS WAITING AT THE DOOR I HAD SOME FLURRIED THOUGHT OF ASKING IF THAT WERE MR BLACKBOYS IN IMITATION OF POOR BARKIS BEGGING PARDON AND RETREATING BUT I KEPT MY GROUND MR MILLS WAS NOT AT HOME I DID NOT EXPECT HE WOULD BE NOBODY WANTED HIM MISS MILLS WAS AT HOME MISS MILLS WOULD DO I WAS SHOWN INTO A ROOM UPSTAIRS WHERE MISS MILLS AND DORA WERE JIP WAS THERE MISS MILLS WAS COPYING MUSIC I RECOLLECT IT WAS A NEW SONG CALLED AFFECTIONS DIRGE AND DORA WAS PAINTING FLOWERS WHAT WERE MY FEELINGS WHEN I RECOGNIZED MY OWN FLOWERS THE IDENTICAL COVENT GARDEN MARKET PURCHASE I CANNOT SAY THAT THEY WERE VERY LIKE OR THAT THEY PARTICULARLY RESEMBLED ANY FLOWERS THAT HAVE EVER COME UNDER MY OBSERVATION BUT I KNEW FROM THE PAPER ROUND THEM WHICH WAS ACCURATELY COPIED WHAT THE COMPOSITION WAS MISS MILLS WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE ME AND VERY SORRY HER PAPA WAS NOT AT HOME THOUGH I THOUGHT WE ALL BORE THAT WITH FORTITUDE MISS MILLS WAS CONVERSATIONAL FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN LAYING DOWN HER PEN UPON AFFECTIONS DIRGE GOT UP AND LEFT THE ROOM I BEGAN TO THINK I WOULD PUT IT OFF TILL TOMORROW I HOPE YOUR POOR HORSE WAS NOT TIRED WHEN HE GOT HOME AT NIGHT SAID DORA LIFTING UP HER BEAUTIFUL EYES IT WAS A LONG WAY FOR HIM I BEGAN TO THINK I WOULD DO IT TODAY IT WAS A LONG WAY FOR HIM SAID I FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO UPHOLD HIM ON THE JOURNEY WASNT HE FED POOR THING ASKED DORA I BEGAN TO THINK I WOULD PUT IT OFF TILL TOMORROW YEYES I SAID HE WAS WELL TAKEN CARE OF I MEAN HE HAD NOT THE UNUTTERABLE HAPPINESS THAT I HAD IN BEING SO NEAR YOU DORA BENT HER HEAD OVER HER DRAWING AND SAID AFTER A LITTLE WHILEI HAD SAT IN THE INTERVAL IN A BURNING FEVER AND WITH MY LEGS IN A VERY RIGID STATE YOU DIDNT SEEM TO BE SENSIBLE OF THAT HAPPINESS YOURSELF AT ONE TIME OF THE DAY I SAW NOW THAT I WAS IN FOR IT AND IT MUST BE DONE ON THE SPOT YOU DIDNT CARE FOR THAT HAPPINESS IN THE LEAST SAID DORA SLIGHTLY RAISING HER EYEBROWS AND SHAKING HER HEAD WHEN YOU WERE SITTING BY MISS KITT KITT I SHOULD OBSERVE WAS THE NAME OF THE CREATURE IN PINK WITH THE LITTLE EYES THOUGH CERTAINLY I DONT KNOW WHY YOU SHOULD SAID DORA OR WHY YOU SHOULD CALL IT A HAPPINESS AT ALL BUT OF COURSE YOU DONT MEAN WHAT YOU SAY AND I AM SURE NO ONE DOUBTS YOUR BEING AT LIBERTY TO DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE JIP YOU NAUGHTY BOY COME HERE I DONT KNOW HOW I DID IT I DID IT IN A MOMENT I INTERCEPTED JIP I HAD DORA IN MY ARMS I WAS FULL OF ELOQUENCE I NEVER STOPPED FOR A WORD I TOLD HER HOW I LOVED HER I TOLD HER I SHOULD DIE WITHOUT HER I TOLD HER THAT I IDOLIZED AND WORSHIPPED HER JIP BARKED MADLY ALL THE TIME WHEN DORA HUNG HER HEAD AND CRIED AND TREMBLED MY ELOQUENCE INCREASED SO MUCH THE MORE IF SHE WOULD LIKE ME TO DIE FOR HER SHE HAD BUT TO SAY THE WORD AND I WAS READY LIFE WITHOUT DORAS LOVE WAS NOT A THING TO HAVE ON ANY TERMS I COULDNT BEAR IT AND I WOULDNT I HAD LOVED HER EVERY MINUTE DAY AND NIGHT SINCE I FIRST SAW HER I LOVED HER AT THAT MINUTE TO DISTRACTION I SHOULD ALWAYS LOVE HER EVERY MINUTE TO DISTRACTION LOVERS HAD LOVED BEFORE AND LOVERS WOULD LOVE AGAIN BUT NO LOVER HAD LOVED MIGHT COULD WOULD OR SHOULD EVER LOVE AS I LOVED DORA THE MORE I RAVED THE MORE JIP BARKED EACH OF US IN HIS OWN WAY GOT MORE MAD EVERY MOMENT WELL WELL DORA AND I WERE SITTING ON THE SOFA BY AND BY QUIET ENOUGH AND JIP WAS LYING IN HER LAP WINKING PEACEFULLY AT ME IT WAS OFF MY MIND I WAS IN A STATE OF PERFECT RAPTURE DORA AND I WERE ENGAGED I SUPPOSE WE HAD SOME NOTION THAT THIS WAS TO END IN MARRIAGE WE MUST HAVE HAD SOME BECAUSE DORA STIPULATED THAT WE WERE NEVER TO BE MARRIED WITHOUT HER PAPAS CONSENT BUT IN OUR YOUTHFUL ECSTASY I DONT THINK THAT WE REALLY LOOKED BEFORE US OR BEHIND US OR HAD ANY ASPIRATION BEYOND THE IGNORANT PRESENT WE WERE TO KEEP OUR SECRET FROM MR SPENLOW BUT I AM SURE THE IDEA NEVER ENTERED MY HEAD THEN THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING DISHONOURABLE IN THAT MISS MILLS WAS MORE THAN USUALLY PENSIVE WHEN DORA GOING TO FIND HER BROUGHT HER BACKI APPREHEND BECAUSE THERE WAS A TENDENCY IN WHAT HAD PASSED TO AWAKEN THE SLUMBERING ECHOES IN THE CAVERNS OF MEMORY BUT SHE GAVE US HER BLESSING AND THE ASSURANCE OF HER LASTING FRIENDSHIP AND SPOKE TO US GENERALLY AS BECAME A VOICE FROM THE CLOISTER WHAT AN IDLE TIME IT WAS WHAT AN INSUBSTANTIAL HAPPY FOOLISH TIME IT WAS WHEN I MEASURED DORAS FINGER FOR A RING THAT WAS TO BE MADE OF FORGETMENOTS AND WHEN THE JEWELLER TO WHOM I TOOK THE MEASURE FOUND ME OUT AND LAUGHED OVER HIS ORDERBOOK AND CHARGED ME ANYTHING HE LIKED FOR THE PRETTY LITTLE TOY WITH ITS BLUE STONESSO ASSOCIATED IN MY REMEMBRANCE WITH DORAS HAND THAT YESTERDAY WHEN I SAW SUCH ANOTHER BY CHANCE ON THE FINGER OF MY OWN DAUGHTER THERE WAS A MOMENTARY STIRRING IN MY HEART LIKE PAIN WHEN I WALKED ABOUT EXALTED WITH MY SECRET AND FULL OF MY OWN INTEREST AND FELT THE DIGNITY OF LOVING DORA AND OF BEING BELOVED SO MUCH THAT IF I HAD WALKED THE AIR I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ABOVE THE PEOPLE NOT SO SITUATED WHO WERE CREEPING ON THE EARTH WHEN WE HAD THOSE MEETINGS IN THE GARDEN OF THE SQUARE AND SAT WITHIN THE DINGY SUMMERHOUSE SO HAPPY THAT I LOVE THE LONDON SPARROWS TO THIS HOUR FOR NOTHING ELSE AND SEE THE PLUMAGE OF THE TROPICS IN THEIR SMOKY FEATHERS WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST GREAT QUARREL WITHIN A WEEK OF OUR BETROTHAL AND WHEN DORA SENT ME BACK THE RING ENCLOSED IN A DESPAIRING COCKEDHAT NOTE WHEREIN SHE USED THE TERRIBLE EXPRESSION THAT OUR LOVE HAD BEGUN IN FOLLY AND ENDED IN MADNESS WHICH DREADFUL WORDS OCCASIONED ME TO TEAR MY HAIR AND CRY THAT ALL WAS OVER WHEN UNDER COVER OF THE NIGHT I FLEW TO MISS MILLS WHOM I SAW BY STEALTH IN A BACK KITCHEN WHERE THERE WAS A MANGLE AND IMPLORED MISS MILLS TO INTERPOSE BETWEEN US AND AVERT INSANITY WHEN MISS MILLS UNDERTOOK THE OFFICE AND RETURNED WITH DORA EXHORTING US FROM THE PULPIT OF HER OWN BITTER YOUTH TO MUTUAL CONCESSION AND THE AVOIDANCE OF THE DESERT OF SAHARA WHEN WE CRIED AND MADE IT UP AND WERE SO BLEST AGAIN THAT THE BACK KITCHEN MANGLE AND ALL CHANGED TO LOVES OWN TEMPLE WHERE WE ARRANGED A PLAN OF CORRESPONDENCE THROUGH MISS MILLS ALWAYS TO COMPREHEND AT LEAST ONE LETTER ON EACH SIDE EVERY DAY WHAT AN IDLE TIME WHAT AN INSUBSTANTIAL HAPPY FOOLISH TIME OF ALL THE TIMES OF MINE THAT TIME HAS IN HIS GRIP THERE IS NONE THAT IN ONE RETROSPECT I CAN SMILE AT HALF SO MUCH AND THINK OF HALF SO TENDERLY CHAPTER MY AUNT ASTONISHES ME I WROTE TO AGNES AS SOON AS DORA AND I WERE ENGAGED I WROTE HER A LONG LETTER IN WHICH I TRIED TO MAKE HER COMPREHEND HOW BLEST I WAS AND WHAT A DARLING DORA WAS I ENTREATED AGNES NOT TO REGARD THIS AS A THOUGHTLESS PASSION WHICH COULD EVER YIELD TO ANY OTHER OR HAD THE LEAST RESEMBLANCE TO THE BOYISH FANCIES THAT WE USED TO JOKE ABOUT I ASSURED HER THAT ITS PROFUNDITY WAS QUITE UNFATHOMABLE AND EXPRESSED MY BELIEF THAT NOTHING LIKE IT HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN SOMEHOW AS I WROTE TO AGNES ON A FINE EVENING BY MY OPEN WINDOW AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER CLEAR CALM EYES AND GENTLE FACE CAME STEALING OVER ME IT SHED SUCH A PEACEFUL INFLUENCE UPON THE HURRY AND AGITATION IN WHICH I HAD BEEN LIVING LATELY AND OF WHICH MY VERY HAPPINESS PARTOOK IN SOME DEGREE THAT IT SOOTHED ME INTO TEARS I REMEMBER THAT I SAT RESTING MY HEAD UPON MY HAND WHEN THE LETTER WAS HALF DONE CHERISHING A GENERAL FANCY AS IF AGNES WERE ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF MY NATURAL HOME AS IF IN THE RETIREMENT OF THE HOUSE MADE ALMOST SACRED TO ME BY HER PRESENCE DORA AND I MUST BE HAPPIER THAN ANYWHERE AS IF IN LOVE JOY SORROW HOPE OR DISAPPOINTMENT IN ALL EMOTIONS MY HEART TURNED NATURALLY THERE AND FOUND ITS REFUGE AND BEST FRIEND OF STEERFORTH I SAID NOTHING I ONLY TOLD HER THERE HAD BEEN SAD GRIEF AT YARMOUTH ON ACCOUNT OF EMILYS FLIGHT AND THAT ON ME IT MADE A DOUBLE WOUND BY REASON OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING IT I KNEW HOW QUICK SHE ALWAYS WAS TO DIVINE THE TRUTH AND THAT SHE WOULD NEVER BE THE FIRST TO BREATHE HIS NAME TO THIS LETTER I RECEIVED AN ANSWER BY RETURN OF POST AS I READ IT I SEEMED TO HEAR AGNES SPEAKING TO ME IT WAS LIKE HER CORDIAL VOICE IN MY EARS WHAT CAN I SAY MORE WHILE I HAD BEEN AWAY FROM HOME LATELY TRADDLES HAD CALLED TWICE OR THRICE FINDING PEGGOTTY WITHIN AND BEING INFORMED BY PEGGOTTY WHO ALWAYS VOLUNTEERED THAT INFORMATION TO WHOMSOEVER WOULD RECEIVE IT THAT SHE WAS MY OLD NURSE HE HAD ESTABLISHED A GOODHUMOURED ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER AND HAD STAYED TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT WITH HER ABOUT ME SO PEGGOTTY SAID BUT I AM AFRAID THE CHAT WAS ALL ON HER OWN SIDE AND OF IMMODERATE LENGTH AS SHE WAS VERY DIFFICULT INDEED TO STOP GOD BLESS HER WHEN SHE HAD ME FOR HER THEME THIS REMINDS ME NOT ONLY THAT I EXPECTED TRADDLES ON A CERTAIN AFTERNOON OF HIS OWN APPOINTING WHICH WAS NOW COME BUT THAT MRS CRUPP HAD RESIGNED EVERYTHING APPERTAINING TO HER OFFICE THE SALARY EXCEPTED UNTIL PEGGOTTY SHOULD CEASE TO PRESENT HERSELF MRS CRUPP AFTER HOLDING DIVERS CONVERSATIONS RESPECTING PEGGOTTY IN A VERY HIGHPITCHED VOICE ON THE STAIRCASEWITH SOME INVISIBLE FAMILIAR IT WOULD APPEAR FOR CORPOREALLY SPEAKING SHE WAS QUITE ALONE AT THOSE TIMESADDRESSED A LETTER TO ME DEVELOPING HER VIEWS BEGINNING IT WITH THAT STATEMENT OF UNIVERSAL APPLICATION WHICH FITTED EVERY OCCURRENCE OF HER LIFE NAMELY THAT SHE WAS A MOTHER HERSELF SHE WENT ON TO INFORM ME THAT SHE HAD ONCE SEEN VERY DIFFERENT DAYS BUT THAT AT ALL PERIODS OF HER EXISTENCE SHE HAD HAD A CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTION TO SPIES INTRUDERS AND INFORMERS SHE NAMED NO NAMES SHE SAID LET THEM THE CAP FITTED WEAR IT BUT SPIES INTRUDERS AND INFORMERS ESPECIALLY IN WIDDERS WEEDS THIS CLAUSE WAS UNDERLINED SHE HAD EVER ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TO LOOK DOWN UPON IF A GENTLEMAN WAS THE VICTIM OF SPIES INTRUDERS AND INFORMERS BUT STILL NAMING NO NAMES THAT WAS HIS OWN PLEASURE HE HAD A RIGHT TO PLEASE HIMSELF SO LET HIM DO ALL THAT SHE MRS CRUPP STIPULATED FOR WAS THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE BROUGHT IN CONTRACT WITH SUCH PERSONS THEREFORE SHE BEGGED TO BE EXCUSED FROM ANY FURTHER ATTENDANCE ON THE TOP SET UNTIL THINGS WERE AS THEY FORMERLY WAS AND AS THEY COULD BE WISHED TO BE AND FURTHER MENTIONED THAT HER LITTLE BOOK WOULD BE FOUND UPON THE BREAKFASTTABLE EVERY SATURDAY MORNING WHEN SHE REQUESTED AN IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT OF THE SAME WITH THE BENEVOLENT VIEW OF SAVING TROUBLE AND AN ILLCONWENIENCE TO ALL PARTIES AFTER THIS MRS CRUPP CONFINED HERSELF TO MAKING PITFALLS ON THE STAIRS PRINCIPALLY WITH PITCHERS AND ENDEAVOURING TO DELUDE PEGGOTTY INTO BREAKING HER LEGS I FOUND IT RATHER HARASSING TO LIVE IN THIS STATE OF SIEGE BUT WAS TOO MUCH AFRAID OF MRS CRUPP TO SEE ANY WAY OUT OF IT MY DEAR COPPERFIELD CRIED TRADDLES PUNCTUALLY APPEARING AT MY DOOR IN SPITE OF ALL THESE OBSTACLES HOW DO YOU DO MY DEAR TRADDLES SAID I I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU AT LAST AND VERY SORRY I HAVE NOT BEEN AT HOME BEFORE BUT I HAVE BEEN SO MUCH ENGAGED YES YES I KNOW SAID TRADDLES OF COURSE

POSSIBLE SHE MAY HAVE IMPARTED SOMETHING OF THOSE VIRTUES TO ME NOW YOU MENTION IT COPPERFIELD I SHOULDNT WONDER AT ALL I ASSURE YOU SHE IS ALWAYS FORGETTING HERSELF AND TAKING CARE OF THE OTHER NINE IS SHE THE ELDEST I INQUIRED OH DEAR NO SAID TRADDLES THE ELDEST IS A BEAUTY HE SAW I SUPPOSE THAT I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE SIMPLICITY OF THIS REPLY AND ADDED WITH A SMILE UPON HIS OWN INGENUOUS FACE NOT OF COURSE BUT THAT MY SOPHYPRETTY NAME COPPERFIELD I ALWAYS THINK VERY PRETTY SAID I NOT OF COURSE BUT THAT SOPHY IS BEAUTIFUL TOO IN MY EYES AND WOULD BE ONE OF THE DEAREST GIRLS THAT EVER WAS IN ANYBODYS EYES I SHOULD THINK BUT WHEN I SAY THE ELDEST IS A BEAUTY I MEAN SHE REALLY IS A HE SEEMED TO BE DESCRIBING CLOUDS ABOUT HIMSELF WITH BOTH HANDS SPLENDID YOU KNOW SAID TRADDLES ENERGETICALLY INDEED SAID I OH I ASSURE YOU SAID TRADDLES SOMETHING VERY UNCOMMON INDEED THEN YOU KNOW BEING FORMED FOR SOCIETY AND ADMIRATION AND NOT BEING ABLE TO ENJOY MUCH OF IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR LIMITED MEANS SHE NATURALLY GETS A LITTLE IRRITABLE AND EXACTING SOMETIMES SOPHY PUTS HER IN GOOD HUMOUR IS SOPHY THE YOUNGEST I HAZARDED OH DEAR NO SAID TRADDLES STROKING HIS CHIN THE TWO YOUNGEST ARE ONLY NINE AND TEN SOPHY EDUCATES EM THE SECOND DAUGHTER PERHAPS I HAZARDED NO SAID TRADDLES SARAHS THE SECOND SARAH HAS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH HER SPINE POOR GIRL THE

ALIVE SHE IS A VERY SUPERIOR WOMAN INDEED BUT THE DAMP COUNTRY IS NOT ADAPTED TO HER CONSTITUTION ANDIN FACT SHE HAS LOST THE USE OF HER LIMBS DEAR ME SAID I VERY SAD IS IT NOT RETURNED TRADDLES BUT IN A MERELY DOMESTIC VIEW IT IS NOT SO BAD AS IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE SOPHY TAKES HER PLACE SHE IS QUITE AS MUCH A MOTHER TO HER MOTHER AS SHE IS TO THE OTHER NINE I FELT THE GREATEST ADMIRATION FOR THE VIRTUES OF THIS YOUNG LADY AND HONESTLY WITH THE VIEW OF DOING MY BEST TO PREVENT THE GOODNATURE OF TRADDLES FROM BEING IMPOSED UPON TO THE DETRIMENT OF THEIR JOINT PROSPECTS IN LIFE INQUIRED HOW MR MICAWBER WAS HE IS QUITE WELL COPPERFIELD THANK YOU SAID TRADDLES I AM NOT LIVING WITH HIM AT PRESENT NO NO YOU SEE THE TRUTH IS SAID TRADDLES IN A WHISPER HE HAD CHANGED HIS NAME TO MORTIMER IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS TEMPORARY EMBARRASSMENTS AND HE DONT COME OUT TILL AFTER DARKAND THEN IN SPECTACLES THERE WAS AN EXECUTION PUT INTO OUR HOUSE FOR RENT MRS MICAWBER WAS IN SUCH A DREADFUL STATE THAT I REALLY COULDNT RESIST GIVING MY NAME TO THAT SECOND BILL WE SPOKE OF HERE YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WAS TO MY FEELINGS COPPERFIELD TO SEE THE MATTER SETTLED WITH IT AND MRS MICAWBER RECOVER HER SPIRITS HUM SAID I NOT THAT HER HAPPINESS WAS OF LONG DURATION PURSUED TRADDLES FOR UNFORTUNATELY WITHIN A WEEK ANOTHER EXECUTION CAME IN IT BROKE UP THE ESTABLISHMENT I HAVE BEEN LIVING IN A FURNISHED APARTMENT SINCE THEN AND THE MORTIMERS HAVE BEEN VERY PRIVATE INDEED I HOPE YOU WONT THINK IT SELFISH COPPERFIELD IF I MENTION THAT THE BROKER CARRIED OFF MY LITTLE ROUND TABLE WITH THE MARBLE TOP AND SOPHYS FLOWERPOT AND STAND WHAT A HARD THING I EXCLAIMED INDIGNANTLY IT WAS AIT WAS A PULL SAID TRADDLES WITH HIS USUAL WINCE AT THAT EXPRESSION I DONT MENTION IT REPROACHFULLY HOWEVER BUT WITH A MOTIVE THE FACT IS COPPERFIELD I WAS UNABLE TO REPURCHASE THEM AT THE TIME OF THEIR SEIZURE IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THE BROKER HAVING AN IDEA THAT I WANTED THEM RAN THE PRICE UP TO AN EXTRAVAGANT EXTENT AND IN THE SECOND PLACE BECAUSE IHADNT ANY MONEY NOW I HAVE KEPT MY EYE SINCE UPON THE BROKERS SHOP SAID TRADDLES WITH A GREAT ENJOYMENT OF HIS MYSTERY WHICH IS UP AT THE TOP OF TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD AND AT LAST TODAY I FIND THEM PUT OUT FOR SALE I HAVE ONLY NOTICED THEM FROM OVER THE WAY BECAUSE IF THE BROKER SAW ME BLESS YOU HED ASK ANY PRICE FOR THEM WHAT HAS OCCURRED TO ME HAVING NOW THE MONEY IS THAT PERHAPS YOU WOULDNT OBJECT TO ASK THAT GOOD NURSE OF YOURS TO COME WITH ME TO THE SHOPI CAN SHOW IT HER FROM ROUND THE CORNER OF THE NEXT STREETAND MAKE THE BEST BARGAIN FOR THEM AS IF THEY WERE FOR HERSELF THAT SHE CAN THE DELIGHT WITH WHICH TRADDLES PROPOUNDED THIS PLAN TO ME AND THE SENSE HE HAD OF ITS UNCOMMON ARTFULNESS ARE AMONG THE FRESHEST THINGS IN MY REMEMBRANCE I TOLD HIM THAT MY OLD NURSE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO ASSIST HIM AND THAT WE WOULD ALL THREE TAKE THE FIELD TOGETHER BUT ON ONE CONDITION THAT CONDITION WAS THAT HE SHOULD MAKE A SOLEMN RESOLUTION TO GRANT NO MORE LOANS OF HIS NAME OR ANYTHING ELSE TO MR MICAWBER MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID TRADDLES I HAVE ALREADY DONE SO BECAUSE I BEGIN TO FEEL THAT I HAVE NOT ONLY BEEN INCONSIDERATE BUT THAT I HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY UNJUST TO SOPHY MY WORD BEING PASSED TO MYSELF THERE IS NO LONGER ANY APPREHENSION BUT I PLEDGE IT TO YOU TOO WITH THE GREATEST READINESS THAT FIRST UNLUCKY OBLIGATION I HAVE PAID I HAVE NO DOUBT MR MICAWBER WOULD HAVE PAID IT IF HE COULD BUT HE COULD NOT ONE THING I OUGHT TO MENTION WHICH I LIKE VERY MUCH IN MR MICAWBER COPPERFIELD IT REFERS TO THE SECOND OBLIGATION WHICH IS NOT YET DUE HE DONT TELL ME THAT IT IS PROVIDED FOR BUT HE SAYS IT WILL BE NOW I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING VERY FAIR AND HONEST ABOUT THAT I WAS UNWILLING TO DAMP MY GOOD FRIENDS CONFIDENCE AND THEREFORE ASSENTED AFTER A LITTLE FURTHER CONVERSATION WE WENT ROUND TO THE CHANDLERS SHOP TO ENLIST PEGGOTTY TRADDLES DECLINING TO PASS THE EVENING WITH ME BOTH BECAUSE HE ENDURED THE LIVELIEST APPREHENSIONS THAT HIS PROPERTY WOULD BE BOUGHT BY SOMEBODY ELSE BEFORE HE COULD REPURCHASE IT AND BECAUSE IT WAS THE EVENING HE ALWAYS DEVOTED TO WRITING TO THE DEAREST GIRL IN THE WORLD I NEVER SHALL FORGET HIM PEEPING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET IN TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD WHILE PEGGOTTY WAS BARGAINING FOR THE PRECIOUS ARTICLES OR HIS AGITATION WHEN SHE CAME SLOWLY TOWARDS US AFTER VAINLY OFFERING A PRICE AND WAS HAILED BY THE RELENTING BROKER AND WENT BACK AGAIN THE END OF THE NEGOTIATION WAS THAT SHE BOUGHT THE PROPERTY ON TOLERABLY EASY TERMS AND TRADDLES WAS TRANSPORTED WITH PLEASURE I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU INDEED SAID TRADDLES ON HEARING IT WAS TO BE SENT TO WHERE HE LIVED THAT NIGHT IF I MIGHT ASK ONE OTHER FAVOUR I HOPE YOU WOULD NOT THINK IT ABSURD COPPERFIELD I SAID BEFOREHAND CERTAINLY NOT THEN IF YOU WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH SAID TRADDLES TO PEGGOTTY TO GET THE FLOWERPOT NOW I THINK I SHOULD LIKE IT BEING SOPHYS COPPERFIELD TO CARRY IT HOME MYSELF PEGGOTTY WAS GLAD TO GET IT FOR HIM AND HE OVERWHELMED HER WITH THANKS AND WENT HIS WAY UP TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD CARRYING THE FLOWERPOT AFFECTIONATELY IN HIS ARMS WITH ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTED EXPRESSIONS OF COUNTENANCE I EVER SAW WE THEN TURNED BACK TOWARDS MY CHAMBERS AS THE SHOPS HAD CHARMS FOR PEGGOTTY WHICH I NEVER KNEW THEM POSSESS IN THE SAME DEGREE FOR ANYBODY ELSE I SAUNTERED EASILY ALONG AMUSED BY HER STARING IN AT THE WINDOWS AND WAITING FOR HER AS OFTEN AS SHE CHOSE WE WERE THUS A GOOD WHILE IN GETTING TO THE ADELPHI ON OUR WAY UPSTAIRS I CALLED HER ATTENTION TO THE SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE OF MRS CRUPPS PITFALLS AND ALSO TO THE PRINTS OF RECENT FOOTSTEPS WE WERE BOTH VERY MUCH SURPRISED COMING HIGHER UP TO FIND MY OUTER DOOR STANDING OPEN WHICH I HAD SHUT AND TO HEAR VOICES INSIDE WE LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS AND WENT INTO THE SITTINGROOM WHAT WAS MY AMAZEMENT TO FIND OF ALL PEOPLE UPON EARTH MY AUNT THERE AND MR DICK MY AUNT SITTING ON A QUANTITY OF LUGGAGE WITH HER TWO BIRDS BEFORE HER AND HER CAT ON HER KNEE LIKE A FEMALE ROBINSON CRUSOE DRINKING TEA MR DICK LEANING THOUGHTFULLY ON A GREAT KITE SUCH AS WE HAD OFTEN BEEN OUT TOGETHER TO FLY WITH MORE LUGGAGE PILED ABOUT HIM MY DEAR AUNT CRIED I WHY WHAT AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE WE CORDIALLY EMBRACED AND MR DICK AND I CORDIALLY SHOOK HANDS AND MRS CRUPP WHO WAS BUSY MAKING TEA AND COULD NOT

PRESENCE HOW ARE YOU YOU REMEMBER MY AUNT PEGGOTTY SAID I FOR THE LOVE OF GOODNESS CHILD EXCLAIMED MY AUNT DONT CALL THE WOMAN BY THAT SOUTH SEA ISLAND NAME IF SHE MARRIED AND GOT RID OF IT WHICH WAS

AND TOOK THE HAND AND CURTSEYED HER ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS WE ARE OLDER THAN WE WERE I SEE SAID MY AUNT WE HAVE ONLY MET EACH OTHER ONCE BEFORE YOU KNOW A NICE BUSINESS WE MADE OF IT THEN TROT MY DEAR ANOTHER CUP I HANDED IT DUTIFULLY TO MY AUNT WHO WAS IN HER USUAL INFLEXIBLE STATE OF FIGURE AND VENTURED A REMONSTRANCE WITH HER ON THE SUBJECT OF HER SITTING ON A BOX LET ME DRAW THE SOFA HERE OR

HAD BEEN INCESSANTLY SMILING TO EXPRESS SWEET TEMPER AND INCESSANTLY HOLDING HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE TO EXPRESS A GENERAL FEEBLENESS OF CONSTITUTION AND INCESSANTLY RUBBING HER HANDS TO EXPRESS A DESIRE

WEALTHWORSHIPPERS MR DICKWITH RATHER A SCARED LOOK AS IF HE HAD FORGOTTEN ITRETURNED A HASTY ANSWER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MRS CRUPP IS ONE OF THEM SAID MY AUNT BARKIS ILL TROUBLE YOU TO LOOK AFTER THE TEA AND LET ME HAVE ANOTHER CUP FOR I DONT FANCY THAT WOMANS POURINGOUT I KNEW MY AUNT SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO KNOW THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING OF IMPORTANCE ON HER MIND AND THAT THERE WAS FAR MORE MATTER IN THIS ARRIVAL THAN A STRANGER MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED I NOTICED HOW HER EYE LIGHTED ON ME WHEN SHE THOUGHT MY ATTENTION OTHERWISE OCCUPIED AND WHAT A CURIOUS PROCESS OF HESITATION APPEARED TO BE GOING ON WITHIN HER WHILE SHE PRESERVED HER OUTWARD STIFFNESS AND COMPOSURE I BEGAN TO REFLECT WHETHER I HAD DONE ANYTHING TO OFFEND HER AND MY CONSCIENCE WHISPERED ME THAT I HAD NOT YET TOLD HER ABOUT DORA COULD IT BY ANY MEANS BE THAT I WONDERED AS I KNEW SHE WOULD ONLY SPEAK IN HER OWN GOOD TIME I SAT DOWN NEAR HER AND SPOKE TO THE BIRDS AND PLAYED WITH THE CAT AND WAS AS EASY AS I COULD BE BUT I WAS VERY FAR FROM BEING REALLY EASY AND I SHOULD STILL HAVE BEEN SO EVEN IF MR DICK LEANING OVER THE GREAT KITE BEHIND MY AUNT HAD NOT TAKEN EVERY SECRET OPPORTUNITY OF SHAKING HIS HEAD DARKLY AT ME AND POINTING AT HER TROT SAID MY AUNT AT LAST WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED HER TEA AND CAREFULLY SMOOTHED DOWN HER DRESS AND WIPED HER LIPSYOU NEEDNT GO BARKISTROT HAVE YOU GOT TO BE FIRM AND SELFRELIANT I HOPE SO AUNT WHAT DO YOU THINK INQUIRED MISS BETSEY I THINK SO AUNT THEN WHY MY LOVE SAID MY AUNT LOOKING EARNESTLY AT ME WHY DO YOU THINK I PREFER TO SIT UPON THIS PROPERTY OF MINE TONIGHT I SHOOK MY HEAD UNABLE TO GUESS BECAUSE SAID MY AUNT ITS ALL I HAVE BECAUSE IM RUINED MY DEAR IF THE HOUSE AND EVERY ONE OF US HAD TUMBLED OUT INTO THE RIVER TOGETHER I COULD HARDLY HAVE RECEIVED A GREATER SHOCK DICK KNOWS IT SAID MY AUNT LAYING HER HAND CALMLY ON MY SHOULDER I AM RUINED MY DEAR TROT ALL I HAVE IN THE WORLD IS IN THIS ROOM EXCEPT THE COTTAGE AND THAT I HAVE LEFT JANET TO LET BARKIS I WANT TO GET A BED FOR THIS GENTLEMAN TONIGHT TO SAVE EXPENSE PERHAPS YOU CAN MAKE UP SOMETHING HERE FOR MYSELF ANYTHING WILL DO ITS ONLY FOR TONIGHT WELL TALK ABOUT THIS MORE TOMORROW I WAS ROUSED FROM MY AMAZEMENT AND CONCERN FOR HERI AM SURE FOR HERBY HER FALLING ON MY NECK FOR A MOMENT AND CRYING THAT SHE ONLY GRIEVED FOR ME IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE SUPPRESSED THIS EMOTION AND SAID WITH AN ASPECT MORE TRIUMPHANT THAN DEJECTED WE MUST MEET REVERSES BOLDLY AND NOT SUFFER THEM TO FRIGHTEN US MY DEAR WE MUST LEARN TO ACT THE PLAY OUT WE MUST LIVE MISFORTUNE DOWN TROT CHAPTER DEPRESSION AS SOON AS I COULD RECOVER MY PRESENCE OF MIND WHICH QUITE DESERTED ME IN THE FIRST OVERPOWERING SHOCK OF MY AUNTS INTELLIGENCE I PROPOSED TO MR DICK TO COME ROUND TO THE CHANDLERS SHOP AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE BED WHICH MR PEGGOTTY HAD LATELY VACATED THE CHANDLERS SHOP BEING IN HUNGERFORD MARKET AND HUNGERFORD MARKET BEING A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE IN THOSE DAYS THERE WAS A LOW WOODEN COLONNADE BEFORE THE DOOR NOT VERY UNLIKE THAT BEFORE THE HOUSE WHERE THE LITTLE MAN AND WOMAN USED TO LIVE IN THE OLD WEATHERGLASS WHICH PLEASED MR DICK MIGHTILY THE GLORY OF LODGING OVER THIS STRUCTURE WOULD HAVE COMPENSATED HIM I DARE SAY FOR MANY INCONVENIENCES BUT AS THERE WERE REALLY FEW TO BEAR BEYOND THE COMPOUND OF FLAVOURS I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED AND PERHAPS THE WANT OF A LITTLE MORE ELBOWROOM HE WAS PERFECTLY CHARMED WITH HIS ACCOMMODATION MRS CRUPP HAD INDIGNANTLY ASSURED HIM THAT THERE WASNT ROOM TO SWING A CAT THERE BUT AS MR DICK JUSTLY OBSERVED TO ME SITTING DOWN ON THE FOOT OF THE BED NURSING HIS LEG YOU KNOW TROTWOOD I DONT WANT TO SWING A CAT I NEVER DO SWING A CAT THEREFORE WHAT DOES THAT SIGNIFY TO ME I TRIED TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER MR DICK HAD ANY UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSES OF THIS SUDDEN AND GREAT CHANGE IN MY AUNTS AFFAIRS AS I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED HE HAD NONE AT ALL THE ONLY ACCOUNT HE COULD GIVE OF IT WAS THAT MY AUNT HAD SAID TO HIM THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY NOW DICK ARE YOU REALLY AND TRULY THE PHILOSOPHER I TAKE YOU FOR THAT THEN HE HAD SAID YES HE HOPED SO THAT THEN MY AUNT HAD SAID DICK I AM RUINED THAT THEN HE HAD SAID OH INDEED THAT THEN MY AUNT HAD PRAISED HIM HIGHLY WHICH HE WAS GLAD OF AND THAT THEN THEY HAD COME TO ME AND HAD HAD BOTTLED PORTER AND SANDWICHES ON THE ROAD MR DICK WAS SO VERY COMPLACENT SITTING ON THE FOOT OF THE BED NURSING HIS LEG AND TELLING ME THIS WITH HIS EYES WIDE OPEN AND A SURPRISED SMILE THAT I AM SORRY TO SAY I WAS PROVOKED INTO EXPLAINING TO HIM THAT RUIN MEANT DISTRESS WANT AND STARVATION BUT I WAS SOON BITTERLY REPROVED FOR THIS HARSHNESS BY SEEING HIS FACE TURN PALE AND TEARS COURSE DOWN HIS LENGTHENED CHEEKS WHILE HE FIXED UPON ME A LOOK OF SUCH UNUTTERABLE WOE THAT IT MIGHT HAVE SOFTENED A FAR HARDER HEART THAN MINE I TOOK INFINITELY GREATER PAINS TO CHEER HIM UP AGAIN THAN I HAD TAKEN TO DEPRESS HIM AND I SOON UNDERSTOOD AS I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN AT FIRST THAT HE HAD BEEN SO CONFIDENT MERELY BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH IN THE WISEST AND MOST WONDERFUL OF WOMEN AND HIS UNBOUNDED RELIANCE ON MY INTELLECTUAL RESOURCES THE LATTER I BELIEVE HE CONSIDERED A MATCH FOR ANY KIND OF DISASTER NOT ABSOLUTELY MORTAL WHAT CAN WE DO TROTWOOD SAID MR DICK THERES THE MEMORIAL TO BE SURE THERE IS SAID I BUT ALL WE CAN DO JUST NOW MR DICK IS TO KEEP A CHEERFUL COUNTENANCE AND NOT LET MY AUNT SEE THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT IT HE ASSENTED TO THIS IN THE MOST EARNEST MANNER AND IMPLORED ME IF I SHOULD SEE HIM WANDERING AN INCH OUT OF THE RIGHT COURSE TO RECALL HIM BY SOME OF THOSE SUPERIOR METHODS WHICH WERE ALWAYS AT MY COMMAND BUT I REGRET TO STATE THAT THE FRIGHT I HAD GIVEN HIM PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIS BEST ATTEMPTS AT CONCEALMENT ALL THE EVENING HIS EYES WANDERED TO MY AUNTS FACE WITH AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST DISMAL APPREHENSION AS IF HE SAW HER GROWING THIN ON THE SPOT HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THIS AND PUT A CONSTRAINT UPON HIS HEAD BUT HIS KEEPING THAT IMMOVABLE AND SITTING ROLLING HIS EYES LIKE A PIECE OF MACHINERY DID NOT MEND THE MATTER AT ALL I SAW HIM LOOK AT THE LOAF AT SUPPER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE A SMALL ONE AS IF NOTHING ELSE STOOD BETWEEN US AND FAMINE AND WHEN MY AUNT INSISTED ON HIS MAKING HIS CUSTOMARY REPAST I DETECTED HIM IN THE ACT OF POCKETING FRAGMENTS OF HIS BREAD AND CHEESE I HAVE NO DOUBT FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVIVING US WITH THOSE SAVINGS WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE REACHED AN ADVANCED STAGE OF ATTENUATION MY AUNT ON THE OTHER HAND WAS IN A COMPOSED FRAME OF MIND WHICH WAS A LESSON TO ALL OF USTO ME I AM SURE SHE WAS EXTREMELY GRACIOUS TO PEGGOTTY EXCEPT WHEN I INADVERTENTLY CALLED HER BY THAT NAME AND STRANGE AS I KNEW SHE FELT IN LONDON APPEARED QUITE AT HOME SHE WAS TO HAVE MY BED AND I WAS TO LIE IN THE SITTINGROOM TO KEEP GUARD OVER HER SHE MADE A GREAT POINT OF BEING SO NEAR THE RIVER IN CASE OF A CONFLAGRATION AND I SUPPOSE REALLY DID FIND SOME SATISFACTION IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE TROT MY DEAR SAID MY AUNT WHEN SHE SAW ME MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR COMPOUNDING HER USUAL NIGHTDRAUGHT NO NOTHING AUNT NOT WINE MY DEAR ALE BUT THERE IS WINE HERE AUNT AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE IT MADE OF WINE KEEP THAT IN CASE OF SICKNESS SAID MY AUNT WE MUSTNT USE IT CARELESSLY TROT ALE FOR ME HALF A PINT I THOUGHT MR DICK WOULD HAVE FALLEN INSENSIBLE MY AUNT BEING RESOLUTE I WENT OUT AND GOT THE ALE MYSELF AS IT WAS GROWING LATE PEGGOTTY AND MR DICK TOOK THAT OPPORTUNITY OF REPAIRING TO THE CHANDLERS SHOP TOGETHER I PARTED FROM HIM POOR FELLOW AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET WITH HIS GREAT KITE AT HIS BACK A VERY MONUMENT OF HUMAN MISERY MY AUNT WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WHEN I RETURNED CRIMPING THE BORDERS OF HER NIGHTCAP WITH HER FINGERS I WARMED THE ALE AND MADE THE TOAST ON THE USUAL INFALLIBLE PRINCIPLES WHEN IT WAS READY FOR HER SHE WAS READY FOR IT WITH HER NIGHTCAP ON AND THE SKIRT OF HER GOWN TURNED BACK ON HER KNEES MY DEAR SAID MY AUNT AFTER TAKING A SPOONFUL OF IT ITS A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN WINE NOT HALF SO BILIOUS I SUPPOSE I LOOKED DOUBTFUL FOR SHE ADDED TUT TUT CHILD IF NOTHING WORSE THAN ALE HAPPENS TO US WE ARE WELL OFF I SHOULD THINK SO MYSELF AUNT I AM SURE SAID I WELL THEN WHY DONT YOU THINK SO SAID MY AUNT BECAUSE YOU AND I ARE VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE I RETURNED STUFF AND NONSENSE TROT REPLIED MY AUNT MY AUNT WENT ON WITH A QUIET ENJOYMENT IN WHICH THERE WAS VERY LITTLE AFFECTATION IF ANY DRINKING THE WARM ALE WITH A TEASPOON AND SOAKING HER STRIPS OF TOAST IN IT TROT SAID SHE I DONT CARE FOR STRANGE FACES IN GENERAL BUT I RATHER LIKE THAT BARKIS OF YOURS DO YOU KNOW ITS BETTER THAN A HUNDRED POUNDS TO HEAR YOU SAY SO SAID I ITS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY WORLD OBSERVED MY AUNT RUBBING HER NOSE HOW THAT WOMAN EVER GOT INTO IT WITH THAT NAME IS UNACCOUNTABLE TO ME IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE EASY TO BE BORN A JACKSON OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT ONE WOULD THINK PERHAPS SHE THINKS SO TOO ITS NOT HER FAULT SAID I I SUPPOSE NOT RETURNED MY AUNT RATHER GRUDGING THE ADMISSION BUT ITS VERY AGGRAVATING HOWEVER SHES BARKIS NOW THATS SOME COMFORT BARKIS IS UNCOMMONLY FOND OF YOU TROT THERE IS NOTHING SHE WOULD LEAVE UNDONE TO PROVE IT SAID I NOTHING I BELIEVE RETURNED MY AUNT HERE THE POOR FOOL HAS BEEN BEGGING AND PRAYING ABOUT HANDING OVER SOME OF HER MONEYBECAUSE SHE HAS GOT TOO MUCH OF IT A SIMPLETON MY AUNTS TEARS OF PLEASURE WERE POSITIVELY TRICKLING DOWN INTO THE WARM ALE SHES THE MOST RIDICULOUS CREATURE THAT EVER WAS BORN SAID MY AUNT I KNEW FROM THE FIRST MOMENT WHEN I SAW HER WITH THAT POOR DEAR BLESSED BABY OF A MOTHER OF YOURS THAT SHE WAS THE MOST RIDICULOUS OF MORTALS BUT THERE ARE GOOD POINTS IN BARKIS AFFECTING TO LAUGH SHE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING HER HAND TO HER EYES HAVING AVAILED HERSELF OF IT SHE RESUMED HER TOAST AND HER DISCOURSE TOGETHER AH MERCY UPON US SIGHED MY AUNT I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT TROT BARKIS AND MYSELF HAD QUITE A GOSSIP WHILE YOU WERE OUT WITH DICK I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT I DONT KNOW WHERE THESE WRETCHED GIRLS EXPECT TO GO TO FOR MY PART I WONDER THEY DONT KNOCK OUT THEIR BRAINS AGAINSTAGAINST MANTELPIECES SAID MY AUNT AN IDEA WHICH WAS PROBABLY SUGGESTED TO HER BY HER CONTEMPLATION OF MINE POOR EMILY SAID I OH DONT TALK TO ME ABOUT POOR RETURNED MY AUNT SHE SHOULD HAVE

SHE WAS OR NOT I RESENTED THE IDEA OF COURSE BUT I WAS IN A MANNER STRUCK BY IT AS A NEW ONE ALTOGETHER NOT LIGHTHEADED SAID MY AUNT LIGHTHEADED AUNT I COULD ONLY REPEAT THIS DARING SPECULATION WITH THE SAME KIND OF FEELING WITH WHICH I HAD REPEATED THE PRECEDING QUESTION WELL WELL SAID MY AUNT I ONLY ASK I DONT DEPRECIATE HER POOR LITTLE COUPLE AND SO YOU THINK YOU WERE FORMED FOR ONE ANOTHER AND ARE TO GO THROUGH A PARTYSUPPERTABLE KIND OF LIFE LIKE TWO PRETTY PIECES OF CONFECTIONERY DO YOU TROT SHE ASKED ME THIS SO KINDLY AND WITH SUCH A GENTLE AIR HALF PLAYFUL AND HALF SORROWFUL THAT I WAS QUITE TOUCHED WE ARE YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED AUNT I KNOW I REPLIED AND I DARE SAY WE SAY AND THINK A GOOD DEAL THAT IS RATHER FOOLISH BUT WE LOVE ONE ANOTHER TRULY I AM SURE IF I THOUGHT DORA COULD EVER LOVE ANYBODY ELSE OR CEASE TO LOVE ME OR THAT I COULD EVER LOVE ANYBODY ELSE OR CEASE TO LOVE HER I DONT KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DOGO OUT OF MY MIND I THINK AH TROT SAID MY AUNT SHAKING HER HEAD AND SMILING GRAVELY BLIND BLIND BLIND SOMEONE THAT I KNOW TROT MY AUNT PURSUED AFTER A PAUSE THOUGH OF A VERY PLIANT DISPOSITION HAS AN EARNESTNESS OF AFFECTION IN HIM THAT REMINDS ME OF POOR BABY

PROSPEROUS ISSUE ONE OF THESE DAYS THERES TIME ENOUGH FOR IT TO COME TO ANYTHING THIS WAS NOT UPON THE WHOLE VERY COMFORTING TO A RAPTUROUS LOVER BUT I WAS GLAD TO HAVE MY AUNT IN MY CONFIDENCE AND I WAS MINDFUL OF HER BEING FATIGUED SO I THANKED HER ARDENTLY FOR THIS MARK OF HER AFFECTION AND FOR ALL HER OTHER KINDNESSES TOWARDS ME AND AFTER A TENDER GOOD NIGHT SHE TOOK HER NIGHTCAP INTO MY BEDROOM HOW MISERABLE I WAS WHEN I LAY DOWN HOW I THOUGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT MY BEING POOR IN MR SPENLOWS EYES ABOUT MY NOT BEING WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS WHEN I PROPOSED TO DORA ABOUT THE CHIVALROUS NECESSITY OF TELLING DORA WHAT MY WORLDLY CONDITION WAS AND RELEASING HER FROM HER ENGAGEMENT IF SHE THOUGHT FIT ABOUT HOW I SHOULD CONTRIVE TO LIVE DURING THE LONG TERM OF MY ARTICLES WHEN I WAS EARNING NOTHING ABOUT DOING SOMETHING TO ASSIST MY AUNT AND SEEING NO WAY OF DOING ANYTHING ABOUT COMING DOWN TO HAVE NO MONEY IN MY POCKET AND TO WEAR A SHABBY COAT AND TO BE ABLE TO CARRY DORA NO LITTLE PRESENTS AND TO RIDE NO GALLANT GREYS AND TO SHOW MYSELF IN NO AGREEABLE LIGHT SORDID AND SELFISH AS I KNEW IT WAS AND AS I TORTURED MYSELF BY KNOWING THAT IT WAS TO LET MY MIND RUN ON MY OWN DISTRESS SO MUCH I WAS SO DEVOTED TO DORA THAT I COULD NOT HELP IT I KNEW THAT IT WAS BASE IN ME NOT TO THINK MORE OF MY AUNT AND LESS OF MYSELF BUT SO FAR SELFISHNESS WAS INSEPARABLE FROM DORA AND I COULD NOT PUT DORA ON ONE SIDE FOR ANY MORTAL CREATURE HOW EXCEEDINGLY MISERABLE I WAS THAT NIGHT AS TO SLEEP I HAD DREAMS OF POVERTY IN ALL SORTS OF SHAPES BUT I SEEMED TO DREAM WITHOUT THE PREVIOUS CEREMONY OF GOING TO SLEEP NOW I WAS RAGGED WANTING TO SELL DORA MATCHES SIX BUNDLES FOR A HALFPENNY NOW I WAS AT THE OFFICE IN A NIGHTGOWN AND BOOTS REMONSTRATED WITH BY MR SPENLOW ON APPEARING BEFORE THE CLIENTS IN THAT AIRY ATTIRE NOW I WAS HUNGRILY PICKING UP THE CRUMBS THAT FELL FROM OLD TIFFEYS DAILY BISCUIT REGULARLY EATEN WHEN ST PAULS STRUCK ONE NOW I WAS HOPELESSLY ENDEAVOURING TO GET A LICENCE TO MARRY DORA HAVING NOTHING BUT ONE OF URIAH HEEPS GLOVES TO OFFER IN EXCHANGE WHICH THE WHOLE COMMONS REJECTED AND STILL MORE OR LESS CONSCIOUS OF MY OWN ROOM I WAS ALWAYS TOSSING ABOUT LIKE A DISTRESSED SHIP IN A SEA OF BEDCLOTHES MY AUNT WAS RESTLESS TOO FOR I FREQUENTLY HEARD HER WALKING TO AND FRO TWO OR THREE TIMES IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT ATTIRED IN A LONG FLANNEL WRAPPER IN WHICH SHE LOOKED SEVEN FEET HIGH SHE APPEARED LIKE A DISTURBED GHOST IN MY ROOM AND CAME TO THE SIDE OF THE SOFA ON WHICH I LAY ON THE FIRST OCCASION I STARTED UP IN ALARM TO LEARN THAT SHE INFERRED FROM A PARTICULAR LIGHT IN THE SKY THAT WESTMINSTER ABBEY WAS ON FIRE AND TO BE CONSULTED IN REFERENCE TO THE PROBABILITY OF ITS IGNITING BUCKINGHAM STREET IN CASE THE WIND CHANGED LYING STILL AFTER THAT I FOUND THAT SHE SAT DOWN NEAR ME WHISPERING TO HERSELF POOR BOY AND THEN IT MADE ME TWENTY TIMES MORE WRETCHED TO KNOW HOW UNSELFISHLY MINDFUL SHE WAS OF ME AND HOW SELFISHLY MINDFUL I WAS OF MYSELF IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT A NIGHT SO LONG TO ME COULD BE SHORT TO ANYBODY ELSE THIS CONSIDERATION SET ME THINKING AND THINKING OF AN IMAGINARY PARTY WHERE PEOPLE WERE DANCING THE HOURS AWAY UNTIL THAT BECAME A DREAM TOO AND I HEARD THE MUSIC INCESSANTLY PLAYING ONE TUNE AND SAW DORA INCESSANTLY DANCING ONE DANCE WITHOUT TAKING THE LEAST NOTICE OF ME THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN PLAYING THE HARP ALL NIGHT WAS TRYING IN VAIN TO COVER IT WITH AN ORDINARYSIZED NIGHTCAP WHEN I AWOKE OR I SHOULD RATHER SAY WHEN I LEFT OFF TRYING TO GO TO SLEEP AND SAW THE SUN SHINING IN THROUGH THE WINDOW AT LAST THERE WAS AN OLD ROMAN BATH IN THOSE DAYS AT THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THE STREETS OUT OF THE STRANDIT MAY BE THERE STILLIN WHICH I HAVE HAD MANY A COLD PLUNGE DRESSING MYSELF AS QUIETLY AS I COULD AND LEAVING PEGGOTTY TO LOOK AFTER MY AUNT I TUMBLED HEAD FOREMOST INTO IT AND THEN WENT FOR A WALK TO HAMPSTEAD I HAD A HOPE THAT THIS BRISK TREATMENT MIGHT FRESHEN MY WITS A LITTLE AND I THINK IT DID THEM GOOD FOR I SOON CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FIRST STEP I OUGHT TO TAKE WAS TO TRY IF MY ARTICLES COULD BE CANCELLED AND THE PREMIUM RECOVERED I GOT SOME BREAKFAST ON THE HEATH AND WALKED BACK TO DOCTORS COMMONS ALONG THE WATERED ROADS AND THROUGH A PLEASANT SMELL OF SUMMER FLOWERS GROWING IN GARDENS AND CARRIED INTO TOWN ON HUCKSTERS HEADS INTENT ON THIS FIRST EFFORT TO MEET OUR ALTERED CIRCUMSTANCES I ARRIVED AT THE OFFICE SO SOON AFTER ALL THAT I HAD HALF AN HOURS LOITERING ABOUT THE COMMONS BEFORE OLD TIFFEY WHO WAS ALWAYS FIRST APPEARED WITH HIS KEY THEN I SAT DOWN IN MY SHADY CORNER LOOKING UP AT THE SUNLIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE CHIMNEYPOTS AND THINKING ABOUT DORA UNTIL MR SPENLOW CAME IN CRISP AND CURLY HOW ARE YOU COPPERFIELD SAID HE FINE MORNING BEAUTIFUL MORNING SIR SAID I COULD I SAY A WORD TO YOU BEFORE YOU GO INTO COURT BY ALL MEANS SAID HE COME INTO MY ROOM I FOLLOWED HIM INTO HIS ROOM AND HE BEGAN PUTTING ON HIS GOWN AND TOUCHING HIMSELF UP

BLANK EXPRESSION OF HIS FACETO CANCEL MY ARTICLES WHAT IT COST ME TO MAKE THIS PROPOSAL NOBODY KNOWS IT WAS LIKE ASKING AS A FAVOUR TO BE SENTENCED TO TRANSPORTATION FROM DORA TO CANCEL YOUR ARTICLES COPPERFIELD CANCEL I EXPLAINED WITH TOLERABLE FIRMNESS THAT I REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHERE MY MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE WERE TO COME FROM UNLESS I COULD EARN THEM FOR MYSELF I HAD NO FEAR FOR THE FUTURE I SAIDAND I LAID GREAT EMPHASIS ON THAT AS IF TO IMPLY THAT I SHOULD STILL BE DECIDEDLY ELIGIBLE FOR A SONINLAW ONE OF THESE DAYSBUT FOR THE PRESENT I WAS THROWN UPON MY OWN RESOURCES I AM EXTREMELY SORRY TO HEAR THIS COPPERFIELD SAID MR SPENLOW EXTREMELY SORRY IT IS NOT USUAL TO CANCEL ARTICLES FOR ANY SUCH REASON IT IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL COURSE OF PROCEEDING IT IS NOT A CONVENIENT PRECEDENT AT ALL FAR FROM IT AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE VERY GOOD SIR I MURMURED ANTICIPATING A CONCESSION NOT AT ALL DONT MENTION IT SAID MR SPENLOW AT THE SAME TIME I WAS GOING TO SAY IF IT HAD BEEN MY LOT TO HAVE MY HANDS UNFETTEREDIF I HAD NOT A PARTNERMR JORKINS MY HOPES WERE DASHED IN A MOMENT BUT I MADE ANOTHER EFFORT DO YOU THINK SIR SAID I IF I WERE TO MENTION IT TO MR JORKINS MR SPENLOW SHOOK HIS HEAD DISCOURAGINGLY HEAVEN FORBID COPPERFIELD HE REPLIED THAT I SHOULD DO ANY MAN AN INJUSTICE STILL LESS MR JORKINS BUT I KNOW MY PARTNER COPPERFIELD MR JORKINS IS NOT A MAN TO RESPOND TO A PROPOSITION OF THIS PECULIAR NATURE MR JORKINS IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE FROM THE BEATEN TRACK YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS I AM SURE I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM EXCEPT THAT HE HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN ALONE IN THE BUSINESS AND NOW LIVED BY HIMSELF IN A HOUSE NEAR MONTAGU SQUARE WHICH WAS FEARFULLY IN WANT OF PAINTING THAT HE CAME VERY LATE OF A DAY AND WENT AWAY VERY EARLY THAT HE NEVER APPEARED TO BE CONSULTED ABOUT ANYTHING AND THAT HE HAD A DINGY LITTLE BLACKHOLE OF HIS OWN UPSTAIRS WHERE NO BUSINESS WAS EVER DONE AND WHERE THERE WAS A YELLOW OLD CARTRIDGEPAPER PAD UPON HIS DESK UNSOILED BY INK AND REPORTED TO BE TWENTY YEARS OF AGE WOULD YOU OBJECT TO MY MENTIONING IT TO HIM SIR I ASKED BY NO MEANS SAID MR SPENLOW BUT I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE OF MR JORKINS COPPERFIELD I WISH IT WERE OTHERWISE FOR I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO MEET YOUR VIEWS IN ANY RESPECT I CANNOT HAVE THE OBJECTION TO YOUR MENTIONING IT TO MR JORKINS COPPERFIELD IF YOU THINK IT WORTH WHILE AVAILING MYSELF OF THIS PERMISSION WHICH WAS GIVEN WITH A WARM SHAKE OF THE HAND I SAT THINKING ABOUT DORA AND LOOKING AT THE SUNLIGHT STEALING FROM THE CHIMNEYPOTS DOWN THE WALL OF THE OPPOSITE HOUSE UNTIL MR JORKINS CAME I THEN WENT UP TO MR JORKINSS ROOM AND EVIDENTLY ASTONISHED MR JORKINS VERY MUCH BY MAKING MY APPEARANCE THERE COME IN MR COPPERFIELD SAID MR JORKINS COME IN I WENT IN AND SAT DOWN AND STATED MY CASE TO MR JORKINS PRETTY MUCH AS I HAD STATED IT TO MR SPENLOW MR JORKINS WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS THE AWFUL CREATURE ONE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED BUT A LARGE MILD SMOOTHFACED MAN OF SIXTY WHO TOOK SO MUCH SNUFF THAT THERE WAS A TRADITION IN THE COMMONS THAT HE LIVED PRINCIPALLY ON THAT STIMULANT HAVING LITTLE ROOM IN HIS SYSTEM FOR ANY OTHER ARTICLE OF DIET YOU HAVE MENTIONED THIS TO MR SPENLOW I SUPPOSE SAID MR JORKINS WHEN HE HAD HEARD ME VERY RESTLESSLY TO AN END I ANSWERED YES AND TOLD HIM THAT MR SPENLOW HAD INTRODUCED HIS NAME HE SAID I SHOULD OBJECT ASKED MR JORKINS I WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIT THAT MR SPENLOW HAD CONSIDERED IT PROBABLE I AM SORRY TO SAY MR COPPERFIELD I CANT ADVANCE YOUR OBJECT SAID MR JORKINS NERVOUSLY THE FACT ISBUT I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT THE BANK IF YOULL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO EXCUSE ME WITH THAT HE ROSE IN A GREAT HURRY AND WAS GOING OUT OF THE ROOM WHEN I MADE BOLD TO SAY THAT I FEARED THEN THERE WAS NO WAY OF ARRANGING THE MATTER NO SAID MR JORKINS STOPPING AT THE DOOR TO SHAKE HIS HEAD OH NO I OBJECT YOU KNOW WHICH HE SAID VERY RAPIDLY AND WENT OUT YOU MUST BE AWARE MR COPPERFIELD HE ADDED LOOKING RESTLESSLY IN AT THE DOOR AGAIN IF MR SPENLOW OBJECTS PERSONALLY HE DOES NOT OBJECT SIR SAID I OH PERSONALLY REPEATED MR JORKINS IN AN IMPATIENT MANNER I ASSURE YOU THERES AN OBJECTION MR COPPERFIELD HOPELESS WHAT YOU WISH TO BE DONE CANT BE DONE II REALLY HAVE GOT AN APPOINTMENT AT THE BANK WITH THAT HE FAIRLY RAN AWAY AND TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE IT WAS THREE DAYS BEFORE HE SHOWED HIMSELF IN THE COMMONS AGAIN BEING VERY ANXIOUS TO LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED I WAITED UNTIL MR SPENLOW CAME IN AND THEN DESCRIBED WHAT HAD PASSED GIVING HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT I WAS NOT HOPELESS OF HIS BEING ABLE TO SOFTEN THE ADAMANTINE JORKINS IF HE WOULD UNDERTAKE THE TASK COPPERFIELD RETURNED MR SPENLOW WITH A GRACIOUS SMILE YOU HAVE NOT KNOWN MY PARTNER MR JORKINS AS LONG AS I HAVE NOTHING IS FARTHER FROM MY THOUGHTS THAN TO ATTRIBUTE ANY DEGREE OF ARTIFICE TO MR JORKINS BUT MR JORKINS HAS A WAY OF STATING HIS OBJECTIONS WHICH OFTEN DECEIVES PEOPLE NO COPPERFIELD SHAKING HIS HEAD MR JORKINS IS NOT TO BE MOVED BELIEVE ME I WAS COMPLETELY BEWILDERED BETWEEN MR SPENLOW AND MR JORKINS AS TO WHICH OF THEM REALLY WAS THE OBJECTING PARTNER BUT I SAW WITH SUFFICIENT CLEARNESS THAT THERE WAS OBDURACY SOMEWHERE IN THE FIRM AND THAT THE RECOVERY OF MY AUNTS THOUSAND POUNDS WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION IN A STATE OF DESPONDENCY WHICH I REMEMBER WITH ANYTHING BUT SATISFACTION FOR I KNOW IT STILL HAD TOO MUCH REFERENCE TO MYSELF THOUGH ALWAYS IN CONNEXION WITH DORA I LEFT THE OFFICE AND WENT HOMEWARD I WAS TRYING TO FAMILIARIZE MY MIND WITH THE WORST AND TO PRESENT TO MYSELF THE ARRANGEMENTS WE SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE FOR THE FUTURE IN THEIR STERNEST ASPECT WHEN A HACKNEYCHARIOT COMING AFTER ME AND STOPPING AT MY VERY FEET OCCASIONED ME TO LOOK UP A FAIR HAND WAS STRETCHED FORTH TO ME FROM THE WINDOW AND THE FACE I HAD NEVER SEEN WITHOUT A FEELING OF SERENITY AND HAPPINESS FROM THE MOMENT WHEN IT FIRST TURNED BACK ON THE OLD OAK STAIRCASE WITH THE GREAT BROAD BALUSTRADE AND WHEN I ASSOCIATED ITS SOFTENED BEAUTY WITH THE STAINEDGLASS WINDOW IN THE CHURCH WAS SMILING ON ME AGNES I JOYFULLY EXCLAIMED

TO HER I LOOKED AT AGNES WHEN SHE SAID THESE WORDS WITHOUT DETECTING IN HER ANY CONSCIOUSNESS OF URIAHS DESIGN HER MILD BUT EARNEST EYES MET MINE WITH THEIR OWN BEAUTIFUL FRANKNESS AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN HER GENTLE FACE THE CHIEF EVIL OF THEIR PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE SAID AGNES IS THAT I CANNOT BE AS NEAR PAPA AS I COULD WISHURIAH HEEP BEING SO MUCH BETWEEN USAND CANNOT WATCH OVER HIM IF THAT

LITTLE READY MONEY AND I AGREE WITH YOU THE BEST THING WE CAN DO IS TO LIVE THE TERM OUT HERE AND GET A BEDROOM HARD BY I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY TO HINT AT THE DISCOMFORT MY AUNT WOULD SUSTAIN FROM LIVING IN A CONTINUAL STATE OF GUERILLA WARFARE WITH MRS CRUPP BUT SHE DISPOSED OF THAT OBJECTION SUMMARILY BY DECLARING THAT ON THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION OF HOSTILITIES SHE WAS PREPARED TO ASTONISH MRS CRUPP FOR THE WHOLE REMAINDER OF HER NATURAL LIFE I HAVE BEEN THINKING TROTWOOD SAID AGNES DIFFIDENTLY THAT IF YOU HAD TIME I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF TIME AGNES I AM ALWAYS DISENGAGED AFTER FOUR OR FIVE OCLOCK AND I HAVE TIME EARLY IN THE MORNING IN ONE WAY AND ANOTHER SAID I CONSCIOUS OF REDDENING A LITTLE AS I THOUGHT OF THE HOURS AND HOURS I HAD DEVOTED TO FAGGING ABOUT TOWN AND TO AND FRO UPON THE NORWOOD ROAD I HAVE ABUNDANCE OF TIME I KNOW YOU WOULD NOT MIND SAID AGNES COMING TO ME AND SPEAKING IN A LOW VOICE SO FULL OF SWEET AND HOPEFUL CONSIDERATION THAT I HEAR IT NOW THE DUTIES OF A SECRETARY MIND MY DEAR AGNES BECAUSE CONTINUED AGNES DOCTOR STRONG HAS ACTED ON HIS INTENTION OF RETIRING AND HAS COME TO LIVE IN LONDON AND HE ASKED PAPA I KNOW IF HE COULD RECOMMEND HIM ONE DONT YOU THINK HE WOULD RATHER HAVE HIS FAVOURITE OLD PUPIL NEAR HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE DEAR AGNES SAID I WHAT SHOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU YOU ARE ALWAYS MY GOOD ANGEL I TOLD YOU SO I NEVER THINK OF YOU IN ANY OTHER LIGHT AGNES ANSWERED WITH HER PLEASANT LAUGH THAT ONE GOOD ANGEL MEANING DORA WAS ENOUGH AND WENT ON TO REMIND ME THAT THE DOCTOR HAD BEEN USED TO OCCUPY HIMSELF IN HIS STUDY EARLY IN THE MORNING AND IN THE EVENINGAND THAT PROBABLY MY LEISURE WOULD SUIT HIS REQUIREMENTS VERY WELL I WAS SCARCELY MORE DELIGHTED WITH THE PROSPECT OF EARNING MY OWN BREAD THAN WITH THE HOPE OF EARNING IT UNDER MY OLD MASTER IN SHORT ACTING ON THE ADVICE OF AGNES I SAT DOWN AND WROTE A LETTER TO THE DOCTOR STATING MY OBJECT AND APPOINTING TO CALL ON HIM NEXT DAY AT TEN IN THE FORENOON THIS I ADDRESSED TO HIGHGATEFOR IN THAT PLACE SO MEMORABLE TO ME HE LIVEDAND WENT AND POSTED MYSELF WITHOUT LOSING A MINUTE WHEREVER AGNES WAS SOME AGREEABLE TOKEN OF HER NOISELESS PRESENCE SEEMED INSEPARABLE FROM THE PLACE WHEN I CAME BACK I FOUND MY AUNTS BIRDS HANGING JUST AS THEY HAD HUNG SO LONG IN THE PARLOUR WINDOW OF THE COTTAGE AND MY EASYCHAIR IMITATING MY AUNTS MUCH EASIER CHAIR IN ITS POSITION AT THE OPEN WINDOW AND EVEN THE ROUND GREEN FAN WHICH MY AUNT HAD BROUGHT AWAY WITH HER SCREWED ON TO THE WINDOWSILL I KNEW WHO HAD DONE ALL THIS BY ITS SEEMING TO HAVE QUIETLY DONE ITSELF AND I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IN A MOMENT WHO HAD ARRANGED MY NEGLECTED BOOKS IN THE OLD ORDER OF MY SCHOOL DAYS EVEN IF I HAD SUPPOSED AGNES TO BE MILES AWAY INSTEAD OF SEEING HER BUSY WITH THEM AND SMILING AT THE DISORDER INTO WHICH THEY HAD FALLEN MY AUNT WAS QUITE GRACIOUS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE THAMES IT REALLY DID LOOK VERY WELL WITH THE SUN UPON IT THOUGH NOT LIKE THE SEA BEFORE THE COTTAGE BUT SHE COULD NOT RELENT TOWARDS THE LONDON SMOKE WHICH SHE SAID PEPPERED EVERYTHING A COMPLETE REVOLUTION IN WHICH PEGGOTTY BORE A PROMINENT PART WAS BEING EFFECTED IN EVERY CORNER OF MY ROOMS IN REGARD OF THIS PEPPER AND I WAS LOOKING ON THINKING HOW LITTLE EVEN PEGGOTTY SEEMED TO DO WITH A GOOD DEAL OF BUSTLE AND HOW MUCH AGNES DID WITHOUT ANY BUSTLE AT ALL WHEN A KNOCK CAME AT THE DOOR I THINK SAID AGNES TURNING PALE ITS PAPA HE PROMISED ME THAT HE WOULD COME I OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED NOT ONLY MR WICKFIELD BUT URIAH HEEP I HAD NOT SEEN MR WICKFIELD FOR SOME TIME I WAS PREPARED FOR A GREAT CHANGE IN HIM AFTER WHAT I HAD HEARD FROM AGNES BUT HIS APPEARANCE SHOCKED ME IT WAS NOT THAT HE LOOKED MANY YEARS OLDER THOUGH STILL DRESSED WITH THE OLD SCRUPULOUS CLEANLINESS OR THAT THERE WAS AN UNWHOLESOME RUDDINESS UPON HIS FACE OR THAT HIS EYES WERE FULL AND BLOODSHOT OR THAT THERE WAS A NERVOUS TREMBLING IN HIS HAND THE CAUSE OF WHICH I KNEW AND HAD FOR SOME YEARS SEEN AT WORK IT WAS NOT THAT HE HAD LOST HIS GOOD LOOKS OR HIS OLD BEARING OF A GENTLEMANFOR THAT HE HAD NOTBUT THE THING THAT STRUCK ME MOST WAS THAT WITH THE EVIDENCES OF HIS NATIVE SUPERIORITY STILL UPON HIM HE SHOULD SUBMIT HIMSELF TO THAT CRAWLING IMPERSONATION OF MEANNESS URIAH HEEP THE REVERSAL OF THE TWO NATURES IN THEIR RELATIVE POSITIONS URIAHS OF POWER AND MR WICKFIELDS OF DEPENDENCE WAS A SIGHT MORE PAINFUL TO ME THAN I CAN EXPRESS IF I HAD SEEN AN APE TAKING COMMAND OF A MAN I SHOULD HARDLY HAVE THOUGHT IT A MORE DEGRADING SPECTACLE HE APPEARED TO BE ONLY TOO CONSCIOUS OF IT HIMSELF WHEN HE CAME IN HE STOOD STILL AND WITH HIS HEAD BOWED AS IF HE FELT IT THIS WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT FOR AGNES SOFTLY SAID TO HIM PAPA HERE IS MISS TROTWOODAND TROTWOOD WHOM YOU HAVE NOT SEEN FOR A LONG WHILE AND THEN HE APPROACHED AND CONSTRAINEDLY GAVE MY AUNT HIS HAND AND SHOOK HANDS MORE CORDIALLY WITH ME IN THE MOMENTS PAUSE I SPEAK OF I SAW URIAHS COUNTENANCE FORM ITSELF INTO A MOST ILLFAVOURED SMILE AGNES SAW IT TOO I THINK FOR SHE SHRANK FROM HIM WHAT MY AUNT SAW OR DID NOT SEE I DEFY THE SCIENCE OF PHYSIOGNOMY TO HAVE MADE OUT WITHOUT HER OWN CONSENT I BELIEVE THERE NEVER WAS ANYBODY WITH SUCH AN IMPERTURBABLE COUNTENANCE WHEN SHE CHOSE HER FACE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DEADWALL ON THE OCCASION IN QUESTION FOR ANY LIGHT IT THREW UPON HER THOUGHTS UNTIL SHE BROKE SILENCE WITH HER USUAL ABRUPTNESS WELL WICKFIELD SAID MY AUNT AND HE LOOKED UP AT HER FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOUR DAUGHTER HOW WELL I HAVE BEEN DISPOSING OF MY MONEY FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I COULDNT TRUST IT TO YOU AS YOU WERE GROWING RUSTY IN BUSINESS MATTERS WE HAVE BEEN TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER AND GETTING ON VERY WELL ALL THINGS CONSIDERED AGNES IS WORTH THE WHOLE FIRM IN MY OPINION IF I MAY UMBLY MAKE THE REMARK SAID URIAH HEEP WITH A WRITHE I FULLY AGREE WITH MISS BETSEY TROTWOOD AND SHOULD BE ONLY TOO APPY IF MISS AGNES WAS A PARTNER YOURE A PARTNER YOURSELF YOU KNOW RETURNED MY AUNT AND THATS ABOUT ENOUGH FOR YOU I EXPECT HOW DO YOU FIND YOURSELF SIR IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THIS QUESTION ADDRESSED TO HIM WITH EXTRAORDINARY CURTNESS MR HEEP UNCOMFORTABLY CLUTCHING THE BLUE BAG HE CARRIED REPLIED THAT HE WAS PRETTY WELL HE THANKED MY AUNT AND HOPED SHE WAS THE SAME AND YOU MASTERI SHOULD SAY MISTER COPPERFIELD PURSUED URIAH I HOPE I SEE YOU WELL I AM REJOICED TO SEE YOU MISTER COPPERFIELD EVEN UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES I BELIEVED THAT FOR HE SEEMED TO RELISH THEM VERY MUCH PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES IS NOT WHAT YOUR FRIENDS WOULD WISH FOR YOU MISTER COPPERFIELD BUT IT ISNT MONEY MAKES THE MAN ITSI AM REALLY UNEQUAL WITH MY UMBLE POWERS TO EXPRESS WHAT IT IS SAID URIAH WITH A FAWNING JERK BUT IT ISNT MONEY HERE HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME NOT IN THE COMMON WAY BUT STANDING AT A GOOD DISTANCE FROM ME AND LIFTING MY HAND UP AND DOWN LIKE A PUMP HANDLE THAT HE WAS A LITTLE AFRAID OF AND HOW DO YOU THINK WE ARE LOOKING MASTER COPPERFIELDI SHOULD SAY MISTER FAWNED URIAH DONT YOU FIND MR WICKFIELD BLOOMING SIR YEARS DONT TELL MUCH IN OUR FIRM MASTER COPPERFIELD EXCEPT IN RAISING UP THE UMBLE NAMELY MOTHER AND SELFAND IN DEVELOPING HE ADDED AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT THE BEAUTIFUL NAMELY MISS AGNES HE JERKED HIMSELF ABOUT AFTER THIS COMPLIMENT IN SUCH AN INTOLERABLE MANNER THAT MY AUNT WHO HAD SAT LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM LOST ALL PATIENCE DEUCE TAKE THE MAN SAID MY AUNT STERNLY WHATS HE ABOUT DONT BE GALVANIC SIR I ASK YOUR PARDON MISS TROTWOOD RETURNED URIAH IM AWARE YOURE NERVOUS GO ALONG WITH YOU SIR SAID MY AUNT ANYTHING BUT APPEASED DONT PRESUME TO SAY SO I AM NOTHING OF THE SORT IF YOURE AN EEL SIR CONDUCT YOURSELF LIKE ONE IF YOURE A MAN CONTROL YOUR LIMBS SIR GOOD GOD SAID MY AUNT WITH GREAT INDIGNATION I AM NOT GOING TO BE SERPENTINED AND CORKSCREWED OUT OF MY SENSES MR HEEP WAS RATHER ABASHED AS MOST PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BY THIS EXPLOSION WHICH DERIVED GREAT ADDITIONAL FORCE FROM THE INDIGNANT MANNER IN WHICH MY AUNT AFTERWARDS MOVED IN HER CHAIR AND SHOOK HER HEAD AS IF SHE WERE MAKING SNAPS OR BOUNCES AT HIM BUT HE SAID TO ME ASIDE IN A MEEK VOICE I AM WELL AWARE MASTER COPPERFIELD THAT MISS TROTWOOD THOUGH AN EXCELLENT LADY HAS A QUICK TEMPER INDEED I THINK I HAD THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING HER WHEN I WAS A NUMBLE CLERK BEFORE YOU DID MASTER COPPERFIELD AND ITS ONLY NATURAL I AM SURE THAT IT SHOULD BE MADE QUICKER BY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE WONDER IS THAT IT ISNT MUCH WORSE I ONLY CALLED TO SAY THAT IF THERE WAS ANYTHING WE COULD DO IN PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES MOTHER OR SELF OR WICKFIELD AND HEEPWE SHOULD BE REALLY GLAD I MAY GO SO FAR SAID URIAH WITH A SICKLY SMILE AT HIS PARTNER URIAH HEEP SAID MR WICKFIELD IN A MONOTONOUS FORCED WAY IS ACTIVE IN THE BUSINESS TROTWOOD WHAT HE SAYS I QUITE CONCUR IN YOU KNOW I HAD AN OLD INTEREST IN YOU APART FROM THAT WHAT URIAH SAYS I QUITE CONCUR IN OH WHAT A REWARD IT IS SAID URIAH DRAWING UP ONE LEG AT THE RISK OF BRINGING DOWN UPON HIMSELF ANOTHER VISITATION FROM MY AUNT TO BE SO TRUSTED IN BUT I HOPE I AM ABLE TO DO SOMETHING TO RELIEVE HIM FROM THE FATIGUES OF BUSINESS MASTER COPPERFIELD URIAH HEEP IS A GREAT RELIEF TO ME SAID MR WICKFIELD IN THE SAME DULL VOICE ITS A LOAD OFF MY MIND TROTWOOD TO HAVE SUCH A PARTNER THE RED FOX MADE HIM SAY ALL THIS I KNEW TO EXHIBIT HIM TO ME IN THE LIGHT HE HAD INDICATED ON THE NIGHT WHEN HE POISONED MY REST I SAW THE SAME ILLFAVOURED SMILE UPON HIS FACE AGAIN AND SAW HOW HE WATCHED ME YOU ARE NOT GOING PAPA SAID AGNES ANXIOUSLY WILL YOU NOT WALK BACK WITH TROTWOOD AND ME HE WOULD HAVE LOOKED TO URIAH I BELIEVE BEFORE REPLYING IF THAT WORTHY HAD NOT ANTICIPATED HIM I AM BESPOKE MYSELF SAID URIAH ON BUSINESS OTHERWISE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN APPY TO HAVE KEPT WITH MY FRIENDS BUT I LEAVE MY PARTNER TO REPRESENT THE FIRM MISS AGNES EVER YOURS I WISH YOU GOODDAY MASTER COPPERFIELD AND LEAVE MY UMBLE RESPECTS FOR MISS BETSEY TROTWOOD WITH THOSE WORDS HE RETIRED KISSING HIS GREAT HAND AND LEERING AT US LIKE A MASK WE SAT THERE TALKING ABOUT OUR PLEASANT OLD CANTERBURY DAYS AN HOUR OR TWO MR WICKFIELD LEFT TO AGNES SOON BECAME MORE LIKE HIS FORMER SELF THOUGH THERE WAS A SETTLED DEPRESSION UPON HIM WHICH HE NEVER SHOOK OFF FOR ALL THAT HE BRIGHTENED AND HAD AN EVIDENT PLEASURE IN HEARING US RECALL THE LITTLE INCIDENTS OF OUR OLD LIFE MANY OF WHICH HE REMEMBERED VERY WELL HE SAID IT WAS LIKE THOSE TIMES TO BE ALONE WITH AGNES AND ME AGAIN AND HE WISHED TO HEAVEN THEY HAD NEVER CHANGED I AM SURE THERE WAS AN INFLUENCE IN THE PLACID FACE OF AGNES AND IN THE VERY TOUCH OF HER HAND UPON HIS ARM THAT DID WONDERS FOR HIM MY AUNT WHO WAS BUSY NEARLY ALL THIS WHILE WITH PEGGOTTY IN THE INNER ROOM WOULD NOT ACCOMPANY US TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY WERE STAYING BUT INSISTED ON MY GOING AND I WENT WE DINED TOGETHER AFTER DINNER AGNES SAT BESIDE HIM AS OF OLD AND POURED OUT HIS WINE HE TOOK WHAT SHE GAVE HIM AND NO MORELIKE A CHILDAND WE ALL THREE SAT TOGETHER AT A WINDOW AS THE EVENING GATHERED IN WHEN IT WAS ALMOST DARK HE LAY DOWN ON A SOFA AGNES PILLOWING HIS HEAD AND BENDING OVER HIM A LITTLE WHILE AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK TO THE WINDOW IT WAS NOT SO DARK BUT I COULD SEE TEARS GLITTERING IN HER EYES I PRAY HEAVEN THAT I NEVER MAY FORGET THE DEAR GIRL IN HER LOVE AND TRUTH AT THAT TIME OF MY LIFE FOR IF I SHOULD I MUST BE DRAWING NEAR THE END AND THEN I WOULD DESIRE TO REMEMBER HER BEST SHE FILLED MY HEART WITH SUCH GOOD RESOLUTIONS STRENGTHENED MY WEAKNESS SO BY HER EXAMPLE SO DIRECTEDI KNOW NOT HOW SHE WAS TOO MODEST AND GENTLE TO ADVISE ME IN MANY WORDSTHE WANDERING ARDOUR AND UNSETTLED PURPOSE WITHIN ME THAT ALL THE LITTLE GOOD I HAVE DONE AND ALL THE HARM I HAVE FORBORNE I SOLEMNLY BELIEVE I MAY REFER TO HER AND HOW SHE SPOKE TO ME OF DORA SITTING AT THE WINDOW IN THE DARK LISTENED TO MY PRAISES OF HER PRAISED AGAIN AND ROUND THE LITTLE FAIRYFIGURE SHED SOME GLIMPSES OF HER OWN PURE LIGHT THAT MADE IT YET MORE PRECIOUS AND MORE INNOCENT TO ME OH AGNES SISTER OF MY BOYHOOD IF I HAD KNOWN THEN WHAT I KNEW LONG AFTERWARDS THERE WAS A BEGGAR IN THE STREET WHEN I WENT DOWN AND AS I TURNED MY HEAD TOWARDS THE WINDOW THINKING OF HER CALM SERAPHIC EYES HE MADE ME START BY MUTTERING AS IF HE WERE AN ECHO OF THE MORNING BLIND BLIND BLIND CHAPTER ENTHUSIASM I BEGAN THE NEXT DAY WITH ANOTHER DIVE INTO THE ROMAN BATH AND THEN STARTED FOR HIGHGATE I WAS NOT DISPIRITED NOW I WAS NOT AFRAID OF THE SHABBY COAT AND HAD NO YEARNINGS AFTER GALLANT GREYS MY WHOLE MANNER OF THINKING OF OUR LATE MISFORTUNE WAS CHANGED WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS TO SHOW MY AUNT THAT HER PAST GOODNESS TO ME HAD NOT BEEN THROWN AWAY ON AN INSENSIBLE UNGRATEFUL OBJECT WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS TO TURN THE PAINFUL DISCIPLINE OF MY YOUNGER DAYS TO ACCOUNT BY GOING TO WORK WITH A RESOLUTE AND STEADY HEART WHAT I HAD TO DO WAS TO TAKE MY WOODMANS AXE IN MY HAND AND CLEAR MY OWN WAY THROUGH THE FOREST OF DIFFICULTY BY CUTTING DOWN THE TREES UNTIL I CAME TO DORA AND I WENT ON AT A MIGHTY RATE AS IF IT COULD BE DONE BY WALKING WHEN I FOUND MYSELF ON THE FAMILIAR HIGHGATE ROAD PURSUING SUCH A DIFFERENT ERRAND FROM THAT OLD ONE OF PLEASURE WITH WHICH IT WAS ASSOCIATED IT SEEMED AS IF A COMPLETE CHANGE HAD COME ON MY WHOLE LIFE BUT THAT DID NOT DISCOURAGE ME WITH THE NEW LIFE CAME NEW PURPOSE NEW INTENTION GREAT WAS THE LABOUR PRICELESS THE REWARD DORA WAS THE REWARD AND DORA MUST BE WON I GOT INTO SUCH A TRANSPORT THAT I FELT QUITE SORRY MY COAT WAS NOT A LITTLE SHABBY ALREADY I WANTED TO BE CUTTING AT THOSE TREES IN THE FOREST OF DIFFICULTY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHOULD PROVE MY STRENGTH I HAD A GOOD MIND TO ASK AN OLD MAN IN WIRE SPECTACLES WHO WAS BREAKING STONES UPON THE ROAD TO LEND ME HIS HAMMER FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND LET ME BEGIN TO BEAT A PATH TO DORA OUT OF GRANITE I STIMULATED MYSELF INTO SUCH A HEAT AND GOT SO OUT OF BREATH THAT I FELT AS IF I HAD BEEN EARNING I DONT KNOW HOW MUCH IN THIS STATE I WENT INTO A COTTAGE THAT I SAW WAS TO LET AND EXAMINED IT NARROWLYFOR I FELT IT NECESSARY TO BE PRACTICAL IT WOULD DO FOR ME AND DORA ADMIRABLY WITH A LITTLE FRONT GARDEN FOR JIP TO RUN ABOUT IN AND BARK AT THE TRADESPEOPLE THROUGH THE RAILINGS AND A CAPITAL ROOM UPSTAIRS FOR MY AUNT I CAME OUT AGAIN HOTTER AND FASTER THAN EVER AND DASHED UP TO HIGHGATE AT SUCH A RATE THAT I WAS THERE AN HOUR TOO EARLY AND THOUGH I HAD NOT BEEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO STROLL ABOUT TO COOL MYSELF BEFORE I WAS AT ALL PRESENTABLE MY FIRST CARE AFTER PUTTING MYSELF UNDER THIS NECESSARY COURSE OF PREPARATION WAS TO FIND THE DOCTORS HOUSE IT WAS NOT IN THAT PART OF HIGHGATE WHERE MRS STEERFORTH LIVED BUT QUITE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE LITTLE TOWN WHEN I HAD MADE THIS DISCOVERY I WENT BACK IN AN ATTRACTION I COULD NOT RESIST TO A LANE BY MRS STEERFORTHS AND LOOKED OVER THE CORNER OF THE GARDEN WALL HIS ROOM WAS SHUT UP CLOSE THE CONSERVATORY DOORS WERE STANDING OPEN AND ROSA DARTLE WAS WALKING BAREHEADED WITH A QUICK IMPETUOUS STEP UP AND DOWN A GRAVEL WALK ON ONE SIDE OF THE LAWN SHE GAVE ME THE IDEA OF SOME FIERCE THING THAT WAS DRAGGING THE LENGTH OF ITS CHAIN TO AND FRO UPON A BEATEN TRACK AND WEARING ITS HEART OUT I CAME SOFTLY AWAY FROM MY PLACE OF OBSERVATION AND AVOIDING THAT PART OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND WISHING I HAD NOT GONE NEAR IT STROLLED ABOUT UNTIL IT WAS TEN OCLOCK THE CHURCH WITH THE SLENDER SPIRE THAT STANDS ON THE TOP OF THE HILL NOW WAS NOT THERE THEN TO TELL ME THE TIME AN OLD REDBRICK MANSION USED AS A SCHOOL WAS IN ITS PLACE AND A FINE OLD HOUSE IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO GO TO SCHOOL AT AS I RECOLLECT IT WHEN I APPROACHED THE DOCTORS COTTAGEA PRETTY OLD PLACE ON WHICH HE SEEMED TO HAVE EXPENDED SOME MONEY IF I MIGHT JUDGE FROM THE EMBELLISHMENTS AND REPAIRS THAT HAD THE LOOK OF BEING JUST COMPLETEDI SAW HIM WALKING IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE GAITERS AND ALL AS IF HE HAD NEVER LEFT OFF WALKING SINCE THE DAYS OF MY PUPILAGE HE HAD HIS OLD COMPANIONS ABOUT HIM TOO FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF HIGH TREES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TWO OR THREE ROOKS WERE ON THE GRASS LOOKING AFTER HIM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN WRITTEN TO ABOUT HIM BY THE CANTERBURY ROOKS AND WERE OBSERVING HIM CLOSELY IN CONSEQUENCE KNOWING THE UTTER HOPELESSNESS OF ATTRACTING HIS ATTENTION FROM THAT DISTANCE I MADE BOLD TO OPEN THE GATE AND WALK AFTER HIM SO AS TO MEET HIM WHEN HE SHOULD TURN ROUND WHEN HE DID AND CAME TOWARDS ME HE LOOKED AT ME THOUGHTFULLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS EVIDENTLY WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT ME AT ALL AND THEN HIS BENEVOLENT FACE EXPRESSED EXTRAORDINARY PLEASURE AND HE TOOK ME BY BOTH HANDS WHY MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID THE DOCTOR YOU ARE A MAN HOW DO YOU DO I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU MY DEAR COPPERFIELD HOW VERY MUCH YOU HAVE IMPROVED YOU ARE QUITEYESDEAR ME I HOPED HE WAS WELL AND MRS STRONG TOO OH DEAR YES SAID THE DOCTOR ANNIES QUITE WELL AND SHELL BE DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU YOU WERE ALWAYS HER FAVOURITE SHE SAID SO LAST NIGHT WHEN I SHOWED HER YOUR LETTER ANDYES TO BE SUREYOU RECOLLECT MR JACK MALDON COPPERFIELD PERFECTLY SIR OF COURSE SAID THE DOCTOR TO BE SURE HES PRETTY WELL TOO HAS HE COME HOME SIR I INQUIRED FROM INDIA SAID THE DOCTOR YES MR JACK MALDON COULDNT BEAR THE CLIMATE MY DEAR MRS MARKLEHAMYOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN MRS MARKLEHAM FORGOTTEN THE OLD SOLDIER AND IN THAT SHORT TIME MRS MARKLEHAM SAID THE DOCTOR WAS QUITE VEXED ABOUT HIM POOR THING SO WE HAVE GOT HIM AT HOME AGAIN AND WE HAVE BOUGHT HIM A LITTLE PATENT PLACE WHICH AGREES WITH HIM MUCH BETTER I KNEW ENOUGH OF MR JACK MALDON TO SUSPECT FROM THIS ACCOUNT THAT IT WAS A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS NOT MUCH TO DO AND WHICH WAS PRETTY WELL PAID THE DOCTOR WALKING UP AND DOWN WITH HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND HIS KIND FACE TURNED ENCOURAGINGLY TO MINE WENT ON NOW MY DEAR COPPERFIELD IN REFERENCE TO THIS PROPOSAL OF YOURS ITS VERY GRATIFYING AND AGREEABLE TO ME I AM SURE BUT DONT YOU THINK YOU COULD DO BETTER YOU ACHIEVED DISTINCTION YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE WITH US YOU ARE QUALIFIED FOR MANY GOOD THINGS YOU HAVE LAID A FOUNDATION THAT ANY EDIFICE MAY BE RAISED UPON AND IS IT NOT A PITY THAT YOU SHOULD DEVOTE THE SPRINGTIME OF YOUR LIFE TO SUCH A POOR PURSUIT AS I CAN OFFER I BECAME VERY GLOWING AGAIN AND EXPRESSING MYSELF IN A RHAPSODICAL STYLE I AM AFRAID URGED MY REQUEST STRONGLY REMINDING THE DOCTOR THAT I HAD ALREADY A PROFESSION WELL WELL SAID THE DOCTOR THATS TRUE CERTAINLY YOUR HAVING A PROFESSION AND BEING ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN STUDYING IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BUT MY GOOD YOUNG FRIEND WHATS SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR IT DOUBLES OUR INCOME DOCTOR STRONG SAID I DEAR ME REPLIED THE DOCTOR TO THINK OF THAT NOT THAT I MEAN TO SAY ITS RIGIDLY LIMITED TO SEVENTY POUNDS AYEAR BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS CONTEMPLATED MAKING ANY YOUNG FRIEND I MIGHT THUS EMPLOY A PRESENT TOO UNDOUBTEDLY SAID THE DOCTOR STILL WALKING ME UP AND DOWN WITH HIS HAND ON MY SHOULDER I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN AN ANNUAL PRESENT INTO ACCOUNT MY DEAR TUTOR SAID I NOW REALLY WITHOUT ANY NONSENSE TO WHOM I OWE MORE OBLIGATIONS ALREADY THAN I EVER CAN ACKNOWLEDGE NO NO INTERPOSED THE DOCTOR PARDON ME IF YOU WILL TAKE SUCH TIME AS I HAVE AND THAT IS MY MORNINGS AND EVENINGS AND CAN THINK IT WORTH SEVENTY POUNDS A YEAR YOU WILL DO ME SUCH A SERVICE AS I CANNOT EXPRESS DEAR ME SAID THE DOCTOR INNOCENTLY TO THINK THAT SO LITTLE SHOULD GO FOR SO MUCH DEAR DEAR AND WHEN YOU CAN DO BETTER YOU WILL ON YOUR WORD NOW SAID THE DOCTORWHICH HE HAD ALWAYS MADE A VERY GRAVE APPEAL TO THE HONOUR OF US BOYS ON MY WORD SIR I RETURNED ANSWERING IN OUR OLD SCHOOL MANNER THEN BE IT SO SAID THE DOCTOR CLAPPING ME ON THE SHOULDER AND STILL KEEPING HIS HAND THERE AS WE STILL WALKED UP AND DOWN AND I SHALL BE TWENTY TIMES HAPPIER SIR SAID I WITH A LITTLEI HOPE INNOCENTFLATTERY IF MY EMPLOYMENT IS TO BE ON THE DICTIONARY THE DOCTOR STOPPED SMILINGLY CLAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AGAIN AND EXCLAIMED WITH A TRIUMPH MOST DELIGHTFUL TO BEHOLD AS IF I HAD PENETRATED TO THE PROFOUNDEST DEPTHS OF MORTAL SAGACITY MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND YOU HAVE HIT IT IT IS THE DICTIONARY HOW COULD IT BE ANYTHING ELSE HIS POCKETS WERE AS FULL OF IT AS HIS HEAD IT WAS STICKING OUT OF HIM IN ALL DIRECTIONS HE TOLD ME THAT SINCE HIS RETIREMENT FROM SCHOLASTIC LIFE HE HAD BEEN ADVANCING WITH IT WONDERFULLY AND THAT NOTHING COULD SUIT HIM BETTER THAN THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTS FOR MORNING AND EVENING WORK AS IT WAS HIS CUSTOM TO WALK ABOUT IN THE DAYTIME WITH HIS CONSIDERING CAP ON HIS PAPERS WERE IN A LITTLE CONFUSION IN CONSEQUENCE OF MR JACK MALDON HAVING LATELY PROFFERED HIS OCCASIONAL SERVICES AS AN AMANUENSIS AND NOT BEING ACCUSTOMED TO THAT OCCUPATION BUT WE SHOULD SOON PUT RIGHT WHAT WAS AMISS AND GO ON SWIMMINGLY AFTERWARDS WHEN WE WERE FAIRLY AT OUR WORK I FOUND MR JACK MALDONS EFFORTS MORE TROUBLESOME TO ME THAN I HAD EXPECTED AS HE HAD NOT CONFINED HIMSELF TO MAKING NUMEROUS MISTAKES BUT HAD SKETCHED SO MANY SOLDIERS AND LADIES HEADS OVER THE DOCTORS MANUSCRIPT THAT I OFTEN BECAME INVOLVED IN LABYRINTHS OF OBSCURITY THE DOCTOR WAS QUITE HAPPY IN THE PROSPECT OF OUR GOING TO WORK TOGETHER ON THAT WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE AND WE SETTLED TO BEGIN NEXT MORNING AT SEVEN OCLOCK WE WERE TO WORK TWO HOURS EVERY MORNING AND TWO OR THREE HOURS EVERY NIGHT EXCEPT ON SATURDAYS WHEN I WAS TO REST ON SUNDAYS OF COURSE I WAS TO REST ALSO AND I CONSIDERED THESE VERY EASY TERMS OUR PLANS BEING THUS ARRANGED TO OUR MUTUAL SATISFACTION THE DOCTOR TOOK ME INTO THE HOUSE TO PRESENT ME TO MRS STRONG WHOM WE FOUND IN THE DOCTORS NEW STUDY DUSTING HIS BOOKSA FREEDOM WHICH HE NEVER PERMITTED ANYBODY ELSE TO TAKE WITH THOSE SACRED FAVOURITES THEY HAD POSTPONED THEIR BREAKFAST ON MY ACCOUNT AND WE SAT DOWN TO TABLE TOGETHER WE HAD NOT BEEN SEATED LONG WHEN I SAW AN APPROACHING ARRIVAL IN MRS STRONGS FACE BEFORE I HEARD ANY SOUND OF IT A GENTLEMAN ON HORSEBACK CAME TO THE GATE AND LEADING HIS HORSE INTO THE LITTLE COURT WITH THE BRIDLE OVER HIS ARM AS IF HE WERE QUITE AT HOME TIED HIM TO A RING IN THE EMPTY COACHHOUSE WALL AND CAME INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHIP IN HAND IT WAS MR JACK MALDON AND MR JACK MALDON WAS NOT AT ALL IMPROVED BY INDIA I THOUGHT I WAS IN A STATE OF FEROCIOUS VIRTUE HOWEVER AS TO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE NOT CUTTING DOWN TREES IN THE FOREST OF DIFFICULTY AND MY IMPRESSION MUST BE RECEIVED WITH DUE ALLOWANCE MR JACK SAID THE DOCTOR COPPERFIELD MR JACK MALDON SHOOK HANDS WITH ME BUT NOT VERY WARMLY I BELIEVED AND WITH AN AIR OF LANGUID PATRONAGE AT WHICH I SECRETLY TOOK GREAT UMBRAGE BUT HIS LANGUOR ALTOGETHER WAS QUITE A WONDERFUL SIGHT EXCEPT WHEN HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO HIS COUSIN ANNIE HAVE YOU BREAKFASTED THIS MORNING MR JACK SAID THE DOCTOR I HARDLY EVER TAKE BREAKFAST SIR HE REPLIED WITH HIS HEAD THROWN BACK IN AN EASYCHAIR I FIND IT BORES ME IS THERE ANY NEWS TODAY INQUIRED THE DOCTOR NOTHING AT ALL SIR REPLIED MR MALDON THERES AN ACCOUNT ABOUT THE PEOPLE BEING HUNGRY AND DISCONTENTED DOWN IN THE NORTH BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS BEING HUNGRY AND DISCONTENTED SOMEWHERE THE DOCTOR LOOKED GRAVE AND SAID AS THOUGH HE WISHED TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT THEN THERES NO NEWS AT ALL AND NO NEWS THEY SAY IS GOOD NEWS THERES A LONG STATEMENT IN THE PAPERS SIR ABOUT A MURDER OBSERVED MR MALDON BUT SOMEBODY IS ALWAYS BEING MURDERED AND I DIDNT READ IT A DISPLAY OF INDIFFERENCE TO ALL THE ACTIONS AND PASSIONS OF MANKIND WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SUCH A DISTINGUISHED QUALITY AT THAT TIME I THINK AS I HAVE OBSERVED IT TO BE CONSIDERED SINCE I HAVE KNOWN IT VERY FASHIONABLE INDEED I HAVE SEEN IT DISPLAYED WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT I HAVE ENCOUNTERED SOME FINE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHO MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN BORN CATERPILLARS PERHAPS IT IMPRESSED ME THE MORE THEN BECAUSE IT WAS NEW TO ME BUT IT CERTAINLY DID NOT TEND TO EXALT MY OPINION OF OR TO STRENGTHEN MY CONFIDENCE IN MR JACK MALDON I CAME OUT TO INQUIRE WHETHER ANNIE WOULD LIKE TO GO TO THE OPERA TONIGHT SAID MR MALDON TURNING TO HER ITS THE LAST GOOD NIGHT THERE WILL BE THIS SEASON AND THERES A SINGER THERE WHOM SHE REALLY OUGHT TO HEAR SHE IS PERFECTLY EXQUISITE BESIDES WHICH SHE IS SO CHARMINGLY UGLY RELAPSING INTO LANGUOR THE DOCTOR EVER PLEASED WITH WHAT WAS LIKELY TO PLEASE HIS YOUNG WIFE TURNED TO HER AND SAID YOU MUST GO ANNIE YOU MUST GO I WOULD RATHER NOT SHE SAID TO THE DOCTOR I PREFER TO REMAIN AT HOME I WOULD MUCH RATHER REMAIN AT HOME WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER COUSIN SHE THEN ADDRESSED ME AND ASKED ME ABOUT AGNES AND WHETHER SHE SHOULD SEE HER AND WHETHER SHE WAS NOT LIKELY TO COME THAT DAY AND WAS SO MUCH DISTURBED THAT I WONDERED HOW EVEN THE DOCTOR BUTTERING HIS TOAST COULD BE BLIND TO WHAT WAS SO OBVIOUS BUT HE SAW NOTHING HE TOLD HER GOODNATUREDLY THAT SHE WAS YOUNG AND OUGHT TO BE AMUSED AND ENTERTAINED AND MUST NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO BE MADE DULL BY A DULL OLD FELLOW MOREOVER HE SAID HE WANTED TO HEAR HER SING ALL THE NEW SINGERS SONGS TO HIM AND HOW COULD SHE DO THAT WELL UNLESS SHE WENT SO THE DOCTOR PERSISTED IN MAKING THE ENGAGEMENT FOR HER AND MR JACK MALDON WAS TO COME BACK TO DINNER THIS CONCLUDED HE WENT TO HIS PATENT PLACE I SUPPOSE BUT AT ALL EVENTS WENT AWAY ON HIS HORSE LOOKING VERY IDLE I WAS CURIOUS TO FIND OUT NEXT MORNING WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN SHE HAD NOT BUT HAD SENT INTO LONDON TO PUT HER COUSIN OFF AND HAD GONE OUT IN THE AFTERNOON TO SEE AGNES AND HAD PREVAILED UPON THE DOCTOR TO GO WITH HER AND THEY HAD WALKED HOME BY THE FIELDS THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THE EVENING BEING DELIGHTFUL I WONDERED THEN WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE GONE IF AGNES HAD NOT BEEN IN TOWN AND WHETHER AGNES HAD SOME GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER TOO SHE DID NOT LOOK VERY HAPPY I THOUGHT BUT IT WAS A GOOD FACE OR A VERY FALSE ONE I OFTEN GLANCED AT IT FOR SHE SAT IN THE WINDOW ALL THE TIME WE WERE AT WORK AND MADE OUR BREAKFAST WHICH WE TOOK BY SNATCHES AS WE WERE EMPLOYED WHEN I LEFT AT NINE OCLOCK SHE WAS KNEELING ON THE GROUND AT THE DOCTORS FEET PUTTING ON HIS SHOES AND GAITERS FOR HIM THERE WAS A SOFTENED SHADE UPON HER FACE THROWN FROM SOME GREEN LEAVES OVERHANGING THE OPEN WINDOW OF THE LOW ROOM AND I THOUGHT ALL THE WAY TO DOCTORS COMMONS OF THE NIGHT WHEN I HAD SEEN IT LOOKING AT HIM AS HE READ I WAS PRETTY BUSY NOW UP AT FIVE IN THE MORNING AND HOME AT NINE OR TEN AT NIGHT BUT I HAD INFINITE SATISFACTION IN BEING SO CLOSELY ENGAGED AND NEVER WALKED SLOWLY ON ANY ACCOUNT AND FELT ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT THE MORE I TIRED MYSELF THE MORE I WAS DOING TO DESERVE DORA I HAD NOT REVEALED MYSELF IN MY ALTERED CHARACTER TO DORA YET BECAUSE SHE WAS COMING TO SEE MISS MILLS IN A FEW DAYS AND I DEFERRED ALL I HAD TO TELL HER UNTIL THEN MERELY INFORMING HER IN MY LETTERS ALL OUR COMMUNICATIONS WERE SECRETLY FORWARDED THROUGH MISS MILLS THAT I HAD MUCH TO TELL HER IN THE MEANTIME I PUT MYSELF ON A SHORT ALLOWANCE OF BEARS GREASE WHOLLY ABANDONED SCENTED SOAP AND LAVENDER WATER AND SOLD OFF THREE WAISTCOATS AT A PRODIGIOUS SACRIFICE AS BEING TOO LUXURIOUS FOR MY STERN CAREER NOT SATISFIED WITH ALL THESE PROCEEDINGS BUT BURNING WITH IMPATIENCE TO DO SOMETHING MORE I WENT TO SEE TRADDLES NOW LODGING UP BEHIND THE PARAPET OF A HOUSE IN CASTLE STREET HOLBORN MR DICK WHO HAD BEEN WITH ME TO HIGHGATE TWICE ALREADY AND HAD RESUMED HIS COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE DOCTOR I TOOK WITH ME I TOOK MR DICK WITH ME BECAUSE ACUTELY SENSITIVE TO MY AUNTS REVERSES AND SINCERELY BELIEVING THAT NO GALLEYSLAVE OR CONVICT WORKED AS I DID HE HAD BEGUN TO FRET AND WORRY HIMSELF OUT OF SPIRITS AND APPETITE AS HAVING NOTHING USEFUL TO DO IN THIS CONDITION HE FELT MORE INCAPABLE OF FINISHING THE MEMORIAL THAN EVER AND THE HARDER HE WORKED AT IT THE OFTENER THAT UNLUCKY HEAD OF KING CHARLES THE FIRST GOT INTO IT SERIOUSLY APPREHENDING THAT HIS MALADY WOULD INCREASE UNLESS WE PUT SOME INNOCENT DECEPTION UPON HIM AND CAUSED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS USEFUL OR UNLESS WE COULD PUT HIM IN THE WAY OF BEING REALLY USEFUL WHICH WOULD BE BETTER I MADE UP MY MIND TO TRY IF TRADDLES COULD HELP US BEFORE WE WENT I WROTE TRADDLES A FULL STATEMENT OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND TRADDLES WROTE ME BACK A CAPITAL ANSWER EXPRESSIVE OF HIS SYMPATHY AND FRIENDSHIP WE FOUND HIM HARD AT WORK WITH HIS INKSTAND AND PAPERS REFRESHED BY THE SIGHT OF THE FLOWERPOT STAND AND THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE IN A CORNER OF THE SMALL APARTMENT HE RECEIVED US CORDIALLY AND MADE FRIENDS WITH MR DICK IN A MOMENT MR DICK PROFESSED AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY OF HAVING SEEN HIM BEFORE AND WE BOTH SAID VERY LIKELY THE FIRST SUBJECT ON WHICH I HAD TO CONSULT TRADDLES WAS THISI HAD HEARD THAT MANY MEN DISTINGUISHED IN VARIOUS PURSUITS HAD BEGUN LIFE BY REPORTING THE DEBATES IN PARLIAMENT TRADDLES HAVING MENTIONED NEWSPAPERS TO ME AS ONE OF HIS HOPES I HAD PUT THE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND TOLD TRADDLES IN MY LETTER THAT I WISHED TO KNOW HOW I COULD QUALIFY MYSELF FOR THIS PURSUIT TRADDLES NOW INFORMED ME AS THE RESULT OF HIS INQUIRIES THAT THE MERE MECHANICAL ACQUISITION NECESSARY EXCEPT IN RARE CASES FOR THOROUGH EXCELLENCE IN IT THAT IS TO SAY A PERFECT AND ENTIRE COMMAND OF THE MYSTERY OF SHORTHAND WRITING AND READING WAS ABOUT EQUAL IN DIFFICULTY TO THE MASTERY OF SIX LANGUAGES AND THAT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE ATTAINED BY DINT OF PERSEVERANCE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS TRADDLES REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT THIS WOULD SETTLE THE BUSINESS BUT I ONLY FEELING THAT HERE INDEED WERE A FEW TALL TREES TO BE HEWN DOWN IMMEDIATELY RESOLVED TO WORK MY WAY ON TO DORA THROUGH THIS THICKET AXE IN HAND I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU MY DEAR TRADDLES SAID I ILL BEGIN TOMORROW TRADDLES LOOKED ASTONISHED AS HE WELL MIGHT BUT HE HAD NO NOTION AS YET OF MY RAPTUROUS CONDITION ILL BUY A BOOK SAID I WITH A GOOD SCHEME OF THIS ART IN IT ILL WORK AT IT AT THE COMMONS WHERE I HAVENT HALF ENOUGH TO DO ILL TAKE DOWN THE SPEECHES IN OUR COURT FOR PRACTICETRADDLES MY DEAR FELLOW ILL MASTER IT DEAR ME SAID TRADDLES OPENING HIS EYES I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SUCH A DETERMINED CHARACTER COPPERFIELD I DONT KNOW HOW HE SHOULD HAVE HAD FOR IT WAS NEW ENOUGH TO ME I PASSED THAT OFF AND BROUGHT MR DICK ON THE CARPET YOU SEE SAID MR DICK WISTFULLY IF I COULD EXERT MYSELF MR TRADDLESIF I COULD BEAT A DRUMOR BLOW ANYTHING POOR FELLOW I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED SUCH AN EMPLOYMENT IN HIS HEART TO ALL OTHERS TRADDLES WHO WOULD NOT HAVE SMILED FOR THE WORLD REPLIED COMPOSEDLY BUT YOU ARE A VERY GOOD PENMAN SIR YOU TOLD ME SO COPPERFIELD EXCELLENT SAID I AND INDEED HE WAS HE WROTE WITH EXTRAORDINARY NEATNESS DONT YOU THINK SAID TRADDLES YOU COULD COPY WRITINGS SIR IF I GOT THEM FOR YOU MR DICK LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT ME EH TROTWOOD I SHOOK MY HEAD MR DICK SHOOK HIS AND SIGHED TELL HIM ABOUT THE MEMORIAL SAID MR DICK I EXPLAINED TO TRADDLES THAT THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING KING CHARLES THE FIRST OUT OF MR DICKS MANUSCRIPTS MR DICK IN THE MEANWHILE LOOKING VERY DEFERENTIALLY AND SERIOUSLY AT TRADDLES AND SUCKING HIS THUMB BUT THESE WRITINGS YOU KNOW THAT I SPEAK OF ARE ALREADY DRAWN UP AND FINISHED SAID TRADDLES AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION MR DICK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM WOULDNT THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE COPPERFIELD AT ALL EVENTS WOULDNT IT BE WELL TO TRY THIS GAVE US NEW HOPE TRADDLES AND I LAYING OUR HEADS TOGETHER APART WHILE MR DICK ANXIOUSLY WATCHED US FROM HIS CHAIR WE CONCOCTED A SCHEME IN VIRTUE OF WHICH WE GOT HIM TO WORK NEXT DAY WITH TRIUMPHANT SUCCESS ON A TABLE BY THE WINDOW IN BUCKINGHAM STREET WE SET OUT THE WORK TRADDLES PROCURED FOR HIMWHICH WAS TO MAKE I FORGET HOW MANY COPIES OF A LEGAL DOCUMENT ABOUT SOME RIGHT OF WAYAND ON ANOTHER TABLE WE SPREAD THE LAST UNFINISHED ORIGINAL OF THE GREAT MEMORIAL OUR INSTRUCTIONS TO MR DICK WERE THAT HE SHOULD COPY EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD BEFORE HIM WITHOUT THE LEAST DEPARTURE FROM THE ORIGINAL AND THAT WHEN HE FELT IT NECESSARY TO MAKE THE SLIGHTEST ALLUSION TO KING CHARLES THE FIRST HE SHOULD FLY TO THE MEMORIAL WE EXHORTED HIM TO BE RESOLUTE IN THIS AND LEFT MY AUNT TO OBSERVE HIM MY AUNT REPORTED TO US AFTERWARDS THAT AT FIRST HE WAS LIKE A MAN PLAYING THE KETTLEDRUMS AND CONSTANTLY DIVIDED HIS ATTENTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO BUT THAT FINDING THIS CONFUSE AND FATIGUE HIM AND HAVING HIS COPY THERE PLAINLY BEFORE HIS EYES HE SOON SAT AT IT IN AN ORDERLY BUSINESSLIKE MANNER AND POSTPONED THE MEMORIAL TO A MORE CONVENIENT TIME IN A WORD ALTHOUGH WE TOOK GREAT CARE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE NO MORE TO DO THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM AND ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT BEGIN WITH THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK HE EARNED BY THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY NIGHT TEN SHILLINGS AND NINEPENCE AND NEVER WHILE I LIVE SHALL I FORGET HIS GOING ABOUT TO ALL THE SHOPS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO CHANGE THIS TREASURE INTO SIXPENCES OR HIS BRINGING THEM TO MY AUNT ARRANGED IN THE FORM OF A HEART UPON A WAITER WITH TEARS OF JOY AND PRIDE IN HIS EYES HE WAS LIKE ONE UNDER THE PROPITIOUS INFLUENCE OF A CHARM FROM THE MOMENT OF HIS BEING USEFULLY EMPLOYED AND IF THERE WERE A HAPPY MAN IN THE WORLD THAT SATURDAY NIGHT IT WAS THE GRATEFUL CREATURE WHO THOUGHT MY AUNT THE MOST WONDERFUL WOMAN IN EXISTENCE AND ME THE MOST WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN NO STARVING NOW TROTWOOD SAID MR DICK SHAKING HANDS WITH ME IN A CORNER ILL PROVIDE FOR HER SIR AND HE FLOURISHED HIS TEN FINGERS IN THE AIR AS IF THEY WERE TEN BANKS I HARDLY KNOW WHICH WAS THE BETTER PLEASED TRADDLES OR I IT REALLY SAID TRADDLES SUDDENLY TAKING A LETTER OUT OF HIS POCKET AND GIVING IT TO ME PUT MR MICAWBER QUITE OUT OF MY HEAD THE LETTER MR MICAWBER NEVER MISSED ANY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY OF WRITING A LETTER WAS ADDRESSED TO ME BY THE KINDNESS OF T TRADDLES ESQUIRE OF THE INNER TEMPLE IT RAN THUS MY DEAR COPPERFIELD YOU MAY POSSIBLY NOT BE UNPREPARED TO RECEIVE THE INTIMATION THAT SOMETHING HAS TURNED UP I MAY HAVE MENTIONED TO YOU ON A FORMER OCCASION THAT I WAS IN EXPECTATION OF SUCH AN EVENT I AM ABOUT TO ESTABLISH MYSELF IN ONE OF THE PROVINCIAL TOWNS OF OUR FAVOURED ISLAND WHERE THE SOCIETY MAY BE DESCRIBED AS A HAPPY ADMIXTURE OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND THE CLERICAL IN IMMEDIATE CONNEXION WITH ONE OF THE LEARNED PROFESSIONS MRS MICAWBER AND OUR OFFSPRING WILL ACCOMPANY ME OUR ASHES AT A FUTURE PERIOD WILL PROBABLY BE FOUND COMMINGLED IN THE CEMETERY ATTACHED TO A VENERABLE PILE FOR WHICH THE SPOT TO WHICH I REFER HAS ACQUIRED A REPUTATION SHALL I SAY FROM CHINA TO PERU IN BIDDING ADIEU TO THE MODERN BABYLON WHERE WE HAVE UNDERGONE MANY VICISSITUDES I TRUST NOT IGNOBLY MRS MICAWBER AND MYSELF CANNOT DISGUISE FROM OUR MINDS THAT WE PART IT MAY BE FOR YEARS AND IT MAY BE FOR EVER WITH AN INDIVIDUAL LINKED BY STRONG ASSOCIATIONS TO THE ALTAR OF OUR DOMESTIC LIFE IF ON THE EVE OF SUCH A DEPARTURE YOU WILL ACCOMPANY OUR MUTUAL FRIEND MR THOMAS TRADDLES TO OUR PRESENT ABODE AND THERE RECIPROCATE THE WISHES NATURAL TO THE OCCASION YOU WILL CONFER A BOON ON ONE WHO IS EVER YOURS WILKINS MICAWBER I WAS GLAD TO FIND THAT MR MICAWBER HAD GOT RID OF HIS DUST AND ASHES AND THAT SOMETHING REALLY HAD TURNED UP AT LAST LEARNING FROM TRADDLES THAT THE INVITATION REFERRED TO THE EVENING THEN WEARING AWAY I EXPRESSED MY READINESS TO DO HONOUR TO IT AND WE WENT OFF TOGETHER TO THE LODGING WHICH MR MICAWBER OCCUPIED AS MR MORTIMER AND WHICH WAS SITUATED NEAR THE TOP OF THE GRAYS INN ROAD THE RESOURCES OF THIS LODGING WERE SO LIMITED THAT WE FOUND THE TWINS NOW SOME EIGHT OR NINE YEARS OLD REPOSING IN A TURNUP BEDSTEAD IN THE FAMILY SITTINGROOM WHERE MR MICAWBER HAD PREPARED IN A WASHHANDSTAND JUG WHAT HE CALLED A BREW OF THE AGREEABLE BEVERAGE FOR WHICH HE WAS FAMOUS I HAD THE PLEASURE ON THIS OCCASION OF RENEWING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MASTER MICAWBER WHOM I FOUND A PROMISING BOY OF ABOUT TWELVE OR THIRTEEN VERY SUBJECT TO THAT RESTLESSNESS OF LIMB WHICH IS NOT AN UNFREQUENT PHENOMENON IN YOUTHS OF HIS AGE I ALSO BECAME ONCE MORE KNOWN TO HIS SISTER MISS MICAWBER IN WHOM AS MR MICAWBER TOLD US HER MOTHER RENEWED HER YOUTH LIKE THE PHOENIX MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER YOURSELF AND MR TRADDLES FIND US ON THE BRINK OF MIGRATION AND WILL EXCUSE ANY LITTLE DISCOMFORTS INCIDENTAL TO THAT POSITION GLANCING ROUND AS I MADE A SUITABLE REPLY I OBSERVED THAT THE FAMILY EFFECTS WERE ALREADY PACKED AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF LUGGAGE WAS BY NO MEANS OVERWHELMING I CONGRATULATED MRS MICAWBER ON THE APPROACHING CHANGE MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD SAID MRS MICAWBER OF YOUR FRIENDLY INTEREST IN ALL OUR AFFAIRS I AM WELL ASSURED MY FAMILY MAY CONSIDER IT BANISHMENT IF THEY PLEASE BUT I AM A WIFE AND MOTHER AND I NEVER WILL DESERT MR MICAWBER TRADDLES APPEALED TO BY MRS MICAWBERS EYE FEELINGLY ACQUIESCED THAT SAID MRS MICAWBER THAT AT LEAST IS MY VIEW MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD AND MR TRADDLES OF THE OBLIGATION WHICH I TOOK UPON MYSELF WHEN I REPEATED THE IRREVOCABLE WORDS I EMMA TAKE THEE WILKINS I READ THE SERVICE OVER WITH A FLATCANDLE ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND THE CONCLUSION I DERIVED FROM IT WAS THAT I NEVER COULD DESERT MR MICAWBER AND SAID MRS MICAWBER THOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE I MAY BE MISTAKEN IN MY VIEW OF THE CEREMONY I NEVER WILL MY DEAR SAID MR MICAWBER A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY I AM NOT CONSCIOUS THAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO ANYTHING OF THE SORT I AM AWARE MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD PURSUED MRS MICAWBER THAT I AM NOW ABOUT TO CAST MY LOT AMONG STRANGERS AND I AM ALSO AWARE THAT THE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY TO WHOM MR MICAWBER HAS WRITTEN IN THE MOST GENTLEMANLY TERMS ANNOUNCING THAT FACT HAVE NOT TAKEN THE LEAST NOTICE OF MR MICAWBERS COMMUNICATION INDEED I MAY BE SUPERSTITIOUS SAID MRS MICAWBER BUT IT APPEARS TO ME THAT MR MICAWBER IS DESTINED NEVER TO RECEIVE ANY ANSWERS WHATEVER TO THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS HE WRITES I MAY AUGUR FROM THE SILENCE OF MY FAMILY THAT THEY OBJECT TO THE RESOLUTION I HAVE TAKEN BUT I SHOULD NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE SWERVED FROM THE PATH OF DUTY MR COPPERFIELD EVEN BY MY PAPA AND MAMA WERE THEY STILL LIVING I EXPRESSED MY OPINION THAT THIS WAS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT MAY BE A SACRIFICE SAID MRS MICAWBER TO IMMURE ONESSELF IN A CATHEDRAL TOWN BUT SURELY MR COPPERFIELD IF IT IS A SACRIFICE IN ME IT IS MUCH MORE A SACRIFICE IN A MAN OF MR MICAWBERS ABILITIES OH YOU ARE GOING TO A CATHEDRAL TOWN SAID I MR MICAWBER WHO HAD BEEN HELPING US ALL OUT OF THE WASHHANDSTAND JUG REPLIED TO CANTERBURY IN FACT MY DEAR COPPERFIELD I HAVE ENTERED INTO ARRANGEMENTS BY VIRTUE OF WHICH I STAND PLEDGED AND CONTRACTED TO OUR FRIEND HEEP TO ASSIST AND SERVE HIM IN THE CAPACITY OFAND TO BEHIS CONFIDENTIAL CLERK I STARED AT MR MICAWBER WHO GREATLY ENJOYED MY SURPRISE I AM BOUND TO STATE TO YOU HE SAID WITH AN OFFICIAL AIR THAT THE BUSINESS HABITS AND THE PRUDENT SUGGESTIONS OF MRS MICAWBER HAVE IN A GREAT MEASURE CONDUCED TO THIS RESULT THE GAUNTLET TO WHICH MRS MICAWBER REFERRED UPON A FORMER OCCASION BEING THROWN DOWN IN THE FORM OF AN ADVERTISEMENT WAS TAKEN UP BY MY FRIEND HEEP AND LED TO A MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF MY FRIEND HEEP SAID MR MICAWBER WHO IS A MAN OF REMARKABLE SHREWDNESS I DESIRE TO SPEAK WITH ALL POSSIBLE RESPECT MY FRIEND HEEP HAS NOT FIXED THE POSITIVE REMUNERATION AT TOO HIGH A FIGURE BUT HE HAS MADE A GREAT DEAL IN THE WAY OF EXTRICATION FROM THE PRESSURE OF PECUNIARY DIFFICULTIES CONTINGENT ON THE VALUE OF MY SERVICES AND ON THE VALUE OF THOSE SERVICES I PIN MY FAITH SUCH ADDRESS AND INTELLIGENCE AS I CHANCE TO POSSESS SAID MR MICAWBER BOASTFULLY DISPARAGING HIMSELF WITH THE OLD GENTEEL AIR WILL BE DEVOTED TO MY FRIEND HEEPS SERVICE I HAVE ALREADY SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LAWAS A DEFENDANT ON CIVIL PROCESSAND I SHALL IMMEDIATELY APPLY MYSELF TO THE COMMENTARIES OF ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT AND REMARKABLE OF OUR ENGLISH JURISTS I BELIEVE IT IS UNNECESSARY TO ADD THAT I ALLUDE TO MR JUSTICE BLACKSTONE THESE OBSERVATIONS AND INDEED THE GREATER PART OF THE OBSERVATIONS MADE THAT EVENING WERE INTERRUPTED BY MRS MICAWBERS DISCOVERING THAT MASTER MICAWBER WAS SITTING ON HIS BOOTS OR HOLDING HIS HEAD ON WITH BOTH ARMS AS IF HE FELT IT LOOSE OR ACCIDENTALLY KICKING TRADDLES UNDER THE TABLE OR SHUFFLING HIS FEET OVER ONE ANOTHER OR PRODUCING THEM AT DISTANCES FROM HIMSELF APPARENTLY OUTRAGEOUS TO NATURE OR LYING SIDEWAYS WITH HIS HAIR AMONG THE WINEGLASSES OR DEVELOPING HIS RESTLESSNESS OF LIMB IN SOME OTHER FORM INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE GENERAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY AND BY MASTER MICAWBERS RECEIVING THOSE DISCOVERIES IN A RESENTFUL SPIRIT I SAT ALL THE WHILE AMAZED BY MR MICAWBERS DISCLOSURE AND WONDERING WHAT IT MEANT UNTIL MRS MICAWBER RESUMED THE THREAD OF THE DISCOURSE AND CLAIMED MY ATTENTION WHAT I PARTICULARLY REQUEST MR MICAWBER TO BE CAREFUL OF IS SAID MRS MICAWBER THAT HE DOES NOT MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD IN APPLYING HIMSELF TO THIS SUBORDINATE BRANCH OF THE LAW PLACE IT OUT OF HIS POWER TO RISE ULTIMATELY TO THE TOP OF THE TREE I AM CONVINCED THAT MR MICAWBER GIVING HIS MIND TO A PROFESSION SO ADAPTED TO HIS FERTILE RESOURCES AND HIS FLOW OF LANGUAGE MUST DISTINGUISH HIMSELF NOW FOR EXAMPLE MR TRADDLES SAID MRS MICAWBER ASSUMING A PROFOUND AIR A JUDGE OR EVEN SAY A CHANCELLOR DOES AN INDIVIDUAL PLACE HIMSELF BEYOND THE PALE OF THOSE PREFERMENTS BY ENTERING ON SUCH AN OFFICE AS MR MICAWBER HAS ACCEPTED MY DEAR OBSERVED MR MICAWBERBUT GLANCING INQUISITIVELY AT TRADDLES TOO WE HAVE TIME ENOUGH BEFORE US FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THOSE QUESTIONS MICAWBER SHE RETURNED NO YOUR MISTAKE IN LIFE IS THAT YOU DO NOT LOOK FORWARD FAR ENOUGH YOU ARE BOUND IN JUSTICE TO YOUR FAMILY IF NOT TO YOURSELF TO TAKE IN AT A COMPREHENSIVE GLANCE THE EXTREMEST POINT IN THE HORIZON TO WHICH YOUR ABILITIES MAY LEAD YOU MR MICAWBER COUGHED AND DRANK HIS PUNCH WITH AN AIR OF EXCEEDING SATISFACTIONSTILL GLANCING AT TRADDLES AS IF HE DESIRED TO HAVE HIS OPINION WHY THE PLAIN STATE OF THE CASE MRS MICAWBER SAID TRADDLES MILDLY BREAKING THE TRUTH TO HER I MEAN THE REAL PROSAIC FACT YOU KNOW JUST SO SAID MRS MICAWBER MY DEAR MR TRADDLES I WISH TO BE AS PROSAIC AND LITERAL AS POSSIBLE ON A SUBJECT OF SO MUCH IMPORTANCE IS SAID TRADDLES THAT THIS BRANCH OF THE LAW EVEN IF MR MICAWBER WERE A REGULAR SOLICITOR EXACTLY SO RETURNED MRS MICAWBER WILKINS YOU ARE SQUINTING AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET YOUR EYES BACK HAS NOTHING PURSUED TRADDLES TO DO WITH THAT ONLY A BARRISTER IS ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH PREFERMENTS AND MR MICAWBER COULD NOT BE A BARRISTER WITHOUT BEING ENTERED AT AN INN OF COURT AS A STUDENT FOR FIVE YEARS DO I FOLLOW YOU SAID MRS MICAWBER WITH HER MOST AFFABLE AIR OF BUSINESS DO I UNDERSTAND MY DEAR MR TRADDLES THAT AT THE EXPIRATION OF THAT PERIOD MR MICAWBER WOULD BE ELIGIBLE AS A JUDGE OR CHANCELLOR HE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE RETURNED TRADDLES WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON THAT WORD THANK YOU SAID MRS MICAWBER THAT IS QUITE SUFFICIENT IF SUCH IS THE CASE AND MR MICAWBER FORFEITS NO PRIVILEGE BY ENTERING ON THESE DUTIES MY ANXIETY IS SET AT REST I SPEAK SAID MRS MICAWBER AS A FEMALE NECESSARILY BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OF OPINION THAT MR MICAWBER POSSESSES WHAT I HAVE HEARD MY PAPA CALL WHEN I LIVED AT HOME THE JUDICIAL MIND AND I HOPE MR MICAWBER IS NOW ENTERING ON A FIELD WHERE THAT MIND WILL DEVELOP ITSELF AND TAKE A COMMANDING STATION I QUITE BELIEVE THAT MR MICAWBER SAW HIMSELF IN HIS JUDICIAL MINDS EYE ON THE WOOLSACK HE PASSED HIS HAND COMPLACENTLY OVER HIS BALD HEAD AND SAID WITH OSTENTATIOUS RESIGNATION MY DEAR WE WILL NOT ANTICIPATE THE DECREES OF FORTUNE IF I AM RESERVED TO WEAR A WIG I AM AT LEAST PREPARED EXTERNALLY IN ALLUSION TO HIS BALDNESS FOR THAT DISTINCTION I DO NOT SAID MR MICAWBER REGRET MY HAIR AND I MAY HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF IT FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE I CANNOT SAY IT IS MY INTENTION MY DEAR COPPERFIELD TO EDUCATE MY SON FOR THE CHURCH I WILL NOT DENY THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY ON HIS ACCOUNT TO ATTAIN TO EMINENCE FOR THE CHURCH SAID I STILL PONDERING BETWEEN WHILES ON URIAH HEEP YES SAID MR MICAWBER HE HAS A REMARKABLE HEADVOICE AND WILL COMMENCE AS A CHORISTER OUR RESIDENCE AT CANTERBURY AND OUR LOCAL CONNEXION WILL NO DOUBT ENABLE HIM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY VACANCY THAT MAY ARISE IN THE CATHEDRAL CORPS ON LOOKING AT MASTER MICAWBER AGAIN I SAW THAT HE HAD A CERTAIN EXPRESSION OF FACE AS IF HIS VOICE WERE BEHIND HIS EYEBROWS WHERE IT PRESENTLY APPEARED TO BE ON HIS SINGING US AS AN ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN THAT AND BED THE WOODPECKER TAPPING AFTER MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THIS PERFORMANCE WE FELL INTO SOME GENERAL CONVERSATION AND AS I WAS TOO FULL OF MY DESPERATE INTENTIONS TO KEEP MY ALTERED CIRCUMSTANCES TO MYSELF I MADE THEM KNOWN TO MR AND MRS MICAWBER I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW EXTREMELY DELIGHTED THEY BOTH WERE BY THE IDEA OF MY AUNTS BEING IN DIFFICULTIES AND HOW COMFORTABLE AND FRIENDLY IT MADE THEM WHEN WE WERE NEARLY COME TO THE LAST ROUND OF THE PUNCH I ADDRESSED MYSELF TO TRADDLES AND REMINDED HIM THAT WE MUST NOT SEPARATE WITHOUT WISHING OUR FRIENDS HEALTH HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS IN THEIR NEW CAREER I BEGGED MR MICAWBER TO FILL US BUMPERS AND PROPOSED THE TOAST IN DUE FORM SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM ACROSS THE TABLE AND KISSING MRS MICAWBER TO COMMEMORATE THAT EVENTFUL OCCASION TRADDLES IMITATED ME IN THE FIRST PARTICULAR BUT DID NOT CONSIDER HIMSELF A SUFFICIENTLY OLD FRIEND TO VENTURE ON THE SECOND MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID MR MICAWBER RISING WITH ONE OF HIS THUMBS IN EACH OF HIS WAISTCOAT POCKETS THE COMPANION OF MY YOUTH IF I MAY BE ALLOWED THE EXPRESSIONAND MY ESTEEMED FRIEND TRADDLES IF I MAY BE PERMITTED TO CALL HIM SOWILL ALLOW ME ON THE PART OF MRS MICAWBER MYSELF AND OUR OFFSPRING TO THANK THEM IN THE WARMEST AND MOST UNCOMPROMISING TERMS FOR THEIR GOOD WISHES IT MAY BE EXPECTED THAT ON THE EVE OF A MIGRATION WHICH WILL CONSIGN US TO A PERFECTLY NEW EXISTENCE MR MICAWBER SPOKE AS IF THEY WERE GOING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES I SHOULD OFFER A FEW VALEDICTORY REMARKS TO TWO SUCH FRIENDS AS I SEE BEFORE ME BUT ALL THAT I HAVE TO SAY IN THIS WAY I HAVE SAID WHATEVER STATION IN SOCIETY I MAY ATTAIN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE LEARNED PROFESSION OF WHICH I AM ABOUT TO BECOME AN UNWORTHY MEMBER I SHALL ENDEAVOUR NOT TO DISGRACE AND MRS MICAWBER WILL BE SAFE TO ADORN UNDER THE TEMPORARY PRESSURE OF PECUNIARY LIABILITIES CONTRACTED WITH A VIEW TO THEIR IMMEDIATE LIQUIDATION BUT REMAINING UNLIQUIDATED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE BEEN UNDER THE NECESSITY OF ASSUMING A GARB FROM WHICH MY NATURAL INSTINCTS RECOILI ALLUDE TO SPECTACLESAND POSSESSING MYSELF OF A COGNOMEN TO WHICH I CAN ESTABLISH NO LEGITIMATE PRETENSIONS ALL I HAVE TO SAY ON THAT SCORE IS THAT THE CLOUD HAS PASSED FROM THE DREARY SCENE AND THE GOD OF DAY IS ONCE MORE HIGH UPON THE MOUNTAIN TOPS ON MONDAY NEXT ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE FOUR OCLOCK AFTERNOON COACH AT CANTERBURY MY FOOT WILL BE ON MY NATIVE HEATHMY NAME MICAWBER MR MICAWBER RESUMED HIS SEAT ON THE CLOSE OF THESE REMARKS AND DRANK TWO GLASSES OF PUNCH IN GRAVE SUCCESSION HE THEN SAID WITH MUCH SOLEMNITY ONE THING MORE I HAVE TO DO BEFORE THIS SEPARATION IS COMPLETE AND THAT IS TO PERFORM AN ACT OF JUSTICE MY FRIEND MR THOMAS TRADDLES HAS ON TWO SEVERAL OCCASIONS PUT HIS NAME IF I MAY USE A COMMON EXPRESSION TO BILLS OF EXCHANGE FOR MY ACCOMMODATION ON THE FIRST OCCASION MR THOMAS TRADDLES WAS LEFTLET ME SAY IN SHORT IN THE LURCH THE FULFILMENT OF THE SECOND HAS NOT YET ARRIVED THE AMOUNT OF THE FIRST OBLIGATION HERE MR MICAWBER CAREFULLY REFERRED TO PAPERS WAS I BELIEVE TWENTYTHREE FOUR NINE AND A HALF OF THE SECOND ACCORDING TO MY ENTRY OF THAT TRANSACTION EIGHTEEN SIX TWO THESE SUMS UNITED MAKE A TOTAL IF MY CALCULATION IS CORRECT AMOUNTING TO FORTYONE TEN ELEVEN AND A HALF MY FRIEND COPPERFIELD WILL PERHAPS DO ME THE FAVOUR TO CHECK THAT TOTAL I DID SO AND FOUND IT CORRECT TO LEAVE THIS METROPOLIS SAID MR MICAWBER AND MY FRIEND MR THOMAS TRADDLES WITHOUT ACQUITTING MYSELF OF THE PECUNIARY PART OF THIS OBLIGATION WOULD WEIGH UPON MY MIND TO AN INSUPPORTABLE EXTENT I HAVE THEREFORE PREPARED FOR MY FRIEND MR THOMAS TRADDLES AND I NOW HOLD IN MY HAND A DOCUMENT WHICH ACCOMPLISHES THE DESIRED OBJECT I BEG TO HAND TO MY FRIEND MR THOMAS TRADDLES MY IOU FOR FORTYONE TEN ELEVEN AND A HALF AND I AM HAPPY TO RECOVER MY MORAL DIGNITY AND TO KNOW THAT I CAN ONCE MORE WALK ERECT BEFORE MY FELLOW MAN WITH THIS INTRODUCTION WHICH GREATLY AFFECTED HIM MR MICAWBER PLACED HIS IOU IN THE HANDS OF TRADDLES AND SAID HE WISHED HIM WELL IN EVERY RELATION OF LIFE I AM PERSUADED NOT ONLY THAT THIS WAS QUITE THE SAME TO MR MICAWBER AS PAYING THE MONEY BUT THAT TRADDLES HIMSELF HARDLY KNEW THE DIFFERENCE UNTIL HE HAD HAD TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT MR MICAWBER WALKED SO ERECT BEFORE HIS FELLOW MAN ON THE STRENGTH OF THIS VIRTUOUS ACTION THAT HIS CHEST LOOKED HALF AS BROAD AGAIN WHEN HE LIGHTED US DOWNSTAIRS WE PARTED WITH GREAT HEARTINESS ON BOTH SIDES AND WHEN I HAD SEEN TRADDLES TO HIS OWN DOOR AND WAS GOING HOME ALONE I THOUGHT AMONG THE OTHER ODD AND CONTRADICTORY THINGS I MUSED UPON THAT SLIPPERY AS MR MICAWBER WAS I WAS PROBABLY INDEBTED TO SOME COMPASSIONATE RECOLLECTION HE RETAINED OF ME AS HIS BOYLODGER FOR NEVER HAVING BEEN ASKED BY HIM FOR MONEY I CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE MORAL COURAGE TO REFUSE IT AND I HAVE NO DOUBT HE KNEW THAT TO HIS CREDIT BE IT WRITTEN QUITE AS WELL AS I DID CHAPTER A LITTLE COLD WATER MY NEW LIFE HAD LASTED FOR MORE THAN A WEEK AND I WAS STRONGER THAN EVER IN THOSE TREMENDOUS PRACTICAL RESOLUTIONS THAT I FELT THE CRISIS REQUIRED I CONTINUED TO WALK EXTREMELY FAST AND TO HAVE A GENERAL IDEA THAT I WAS GETTING ON I MADE IT A RULE TO TAKE AS MUCH OUT OF MYSELF AS I POSSIBLY COULD IN MY WAY OF DOING EVERYTHING TO WHICH I APPLIED MY ENERGIES I MADE A PERFECT VICTIM OF MYSELF I EVEN ENTERTAINED SOME IDEA OF PUTTING MYSELF ON A VEGETABLE DIET VAGUELY CONCEIVING THAT IN BECOMING A GRAMINIVOROUS ANIMAL I SHOULD SACRIFICE TO DORA AS YET LITTLE DORA WAS QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF MY DESPERATE FIRMNESS OTHERWISE THAN AS MY LETTERS DARKLY SHADOWED IT FORTH BUT ANOTHER SATURDAY CAME AND ON THAT SATURDAY EVENING SHE WAS TO BE AT MISS MILLSS AND WHEN MR MILLS HAD GONE TO HIS WHISTCLUB TELEGRAPHED TO ME IN THE STREET BY A BIRDCAGE IN THE DRAWINGROOM MIDDLE WINDOW I WAS TO GO THERE TO TEA BY THIS TIME WE WERE QUITE SETTLED DOWN IN BUCKINGHAM STREET WHERE MR DICK CONTINUED HIS COPYING IN A STATE OF ABSOLUTE FELICITY MY AUNT HAD OBTAINED A SIGNAL VICTORY OVER MRS CRUPP BY PAYING HER OFF THROWING THE FIRST PITCHER SHE PLANTED ON THE STAIRS OUT OF WINDOW AND PROTECTING IN PERSON UP AND DOWN THE STAIRCASE A SUPERNUMERARY WHOM SHE ENGAGED FROM THE OUTER WORLD THESE VIGOROUS MEASURES STRUCK SUCH TERROR TO THE BREAST OF MRS CRUPP THAT SHE SUBSIDED INTO HER OWN KITCHEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT MY AUNT WAS MAD MY AUNT BEING SUPREMELY INDIFFERENT TO MRS CRUPPS OPINION AND EVERYBODY ELSES AND RATHER FAVOURING THAN DISCOURAGING THE IDEA MRS CRUPP OF LATE THE BOLD BECAME WITHIN A FEW DAYS SO FAINTHEARTED THAT RATHER THAN ENCOUNTER MY AUNT UPON THE STAIRCASE SHE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO HIDE HER PORTLY FORM BEHIND DOORSLEAVING VISIBLE HOWEVER A WIDE MARGIN OF FLANNEL PETTICOATOR WOULD SHRINK INTO DARK CORNERS THIS GAVE MY AUNT SUCH UNSPEAKABLE SATISFACTION THAT I BELIEVE SHE TOOK A DELIGHT IN PROWLING UP AND DOWN WITH HER BONNET INSANELY PERCHED ON THE TOP OF HER HEAD AT TIMES WHEN MRS CRUPP WAS LIKELY TO BE IN THE WAY MY AUNT BEING UNCOMMONLY NEAT AND INGENIOUS MADE SO MANY LITTLE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS THAT I SEEMED TO BE RICHER INSTEAD OF POORER AMONG THE REST SHE CONVERTED THE PANTRY INTO A DRESSINGROOM FOR ME AND PURCHASED AND EMBELLISHED A BEDSTEAD FOR MY OCCUPATION WHICH LOOKED AS LIKE A BOOKCASE IN THE DAYTIME AS A BEDSTEAD COULD I WAS THE OBJECT OF HER CONSTANT SOLICITUDE AND MY POOR MOTHER HERSELF COULD NOT HAVE LOVED ME BETTER OR STUDIED MORE HOW TO MAKE ME HAPPY PEGGOTTY HAD CONSIDERED HERSELF HIGHLY PRIVILEGED IN BEING ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE LABOURS AND ALTHOUGH SHE STILL RETAINED SOMETHING OF HER OLD SENTIMENT OF AWE IN REFERENCE TO MY AUNT HAD RECEIVED SO MANY MARKS OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WERE THE BEST FRIENDS POSSIBLE BUT THE TIME HAD NOW COME I AM SPEAKING OF THE SATURDAY WHEN I WAS TO TAKE TEA AT MISS MILLSS WHEN IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HER TO RETURN HOME AND ENTER ON THE DISCHARGE OF THE DUTIES SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN IN BEHALF OF HAM SO GOODBYE BARKIS SAID MY AUNT AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF I AM SURE I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD BE SORRY TO LOSE YOU I TOOK PEGGOTTY TO THE COACH OFFICE AND SAW HER OFF SHE CRIED AT PARTING AND CONFIDED HER BROTHER TO MY FRIENDSHIP AS HAM HAD DONE WE HAD HEARD NOTHING OF HIM SINCE HE WENT AWAY THAT SUNNY AFTERNOON AND NOW MY OWN DEAR DAVY SAID PEGGOTTY IF WHILE YOURE A PRENTICE YOU SHOULD WANT ANY MONEY TO SPEND OR IF WHEN YOURE OUT OF YOUR TIME MY DEAR YOU SHOULD WANT ANY TO SET YOU UP AND YOU MUST DO ONE OR OTHER OR BOTH MY DARLING WHO HAS SUCH A GOOD RIGHT TO ASK LEAVE TO LEND IT YOU AS MY SWEET GIRLS OWN OLD STUPID ME I WAS NOT SO SAVAGELY INDEPENDENT AS TO SAY ANYTHING IN REPLY BUT THAT IF EVER I BORROWED MONEY OF ANYONE I WOULD BORROW IT OF HER NEXT TO ACCEPTING A LARGE SUM ON THE SPOT I BELIEVE THIS GAVE PEGGOTTY MORE COMFORT THAN ANYTHING I COULD HAVE DONE AND MY DEAR WHISPERED PEGGOTTY TELL THE PRETTY LITTLE ANGEL THAT I SHOULD SO HAVE LIKED TO SEE HER ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND TELL HER THAT BEFORE SHE MARRIES MY BOY ILL COME AND MAKE YOUR HOUSE SO BEAUTIFUL FOR YOU IF YOULL LET ME I DECLARED THAT NOBODY ELSE SHOULD TOUCH IT AND THIS GAVE PEGGOTTY SUCH DELIGHT THAT SHE WENT AWAY IN GOOD SPIRITS I FATIGUED MYSELF AS MUCH AS I POSSIBLY COULD IN THE COMMONS ALL DAY BY A VARIETY OF DEVICES AND AT THE APPOINTED TIME IN THE EVENING REPAIRED TO MR MILLSS STREET MR MILLS WHO WAS A TERRIBLE FELLOW TO FALL ASLEEP AFTER DINNER HAD NOT YET GONE OUT AND THERE WAS NO BIRDCAGE IN THE MIDDLE WINDOW HE KEPT ME WAITING SO LONG THAT I FERVENTLY HOPED THE CLUB WOULD FINE HIM FOR BEING LATE AT LAST HE CAME OUT AND THEN I SAW MY OWN DORA HANG UP THE BIRDCAGE AND PEEP INTO THE BALCONY TO LOOK FOR ME AND RUN IN AGAIN WHEN SHE SAW I WAS THERE WHILE JIP REMAINED BEHIND TO BARK INJURIOUSLY AT AN IMMENSE BUTCHERS DOG IN THE STREET WHO COULD HAVE TAKEN HIM LIKE A PILL DORA CAME TO THE DRAWINGROOM DOOR TO MEET ME AND JIP CAME SCRAMBLING OUT TUMBLING OVER HIS OWN GROWLS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS A BANDIT AND WE ALL THREE WENT IN AS HAPPY AND LOVING AS COULD BE I SOON CARRIED DESOLATION INTO THE BOSOM OF OUR JOYSNOT THAT I MEANT TO DO IT BUT THAT I WAS SO FULL OF THE SUBJECTBY ASKING DORA WITHOUT THE SMALLEST PREPARATION IF SHE COULD LOVE A BEGGAR MY PRETTY LITTLE STARTLED DORA HER ONLY ASSOCIATION WITH THE WORD WAS A YELLOW FACE AND A NIGHTCAP OR A PAIR OF CRUTCHES OR A WOODEN LEG OR A DOG WITH A DECANTERSTAND IN HIS MOUTH OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND AND SHE STARED AT ME WITH THE MOST DELIGHTFUL WONDER HOW CAN YOU ASK ME ANYTHING SO FOOLISH POUTED DORA LOVE A BEGGAR DORA MY OWN DEAREST SAID I I AM A BEGGAR HOW CAN YOU BE SUCH A SILLY THING REPLIED DORA SLAPPING MY HAND AS TO SIT THERE TELLING SUCH STORIES ILL MAKE JIP BITE YOU HER CHILDISH WAY WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WAY IN THE WORLD TO ME BUT IT WAS NECESSARY TO BE EXPLICIT AND I SOLEMNLY REPEATED DORA MY OWN LIFE I AM YOUR RUINED DAVID I DECLARE ILL MAKE JIP BITE YOU SAID DORA SHAKING HER CURLS IF YOU ARE SO RIDICULOUS BUT I LOOKED SO SERIOUS THAT DORA LEFT OFF SHAKING HER CURLS AND LAID HER TREMBLING LITTLE HAND UPON MY SHOULDER AND FIRST LOOKED SCARED AND ANXIOUS THEN BEGAN TO CRY THAT WAS DREADFUL I FELL UPON MY KNEES BEFORE THE SOFA CARESSING HER AND IMPLORING HER NOT TO REND MY HEART BUT FOR SOME TIME POOR LITTLE DORA DID NOTHING BUT EXCLAIM OH DEAR OH DEAR AND OH SHE WAS SO FRIGHTENED AND WHERE WAS JULIA MILLS AND OH TAKE HER TO JULIA MILLS AND GO AWAY PLEASE UNTIL I WAS ALMOST BESIDE MYSELF AT LAST AFTER AN AGONY OF SUPPLICATION AND PROTESTATION I GOT DORA TO LOOK AT ME WITH A HORRIFIED EXPRESSION OF FACE WHICH I GRADUALLY SOOTHED UNTIL IT WAS ONLY LOVING AND HER SOFT PRETTY CHEEK WAS LYING AGAINST MINE THEN I TOLD HER WITH MY ARMS CLASPED ROUND HER HOW I LOVED HER SO DEARLY AND SO DEARLY HOW I FELT IT RIGHT TO OFFER TO RELEASE HER FROM HER ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE NOW I WAS POOR HOW I NEVER COULD BEAR IT OR RECOVER IT IF I LOST HER HOW I HAD NO FEARS OF POVERTY IF SHE HAD NONE MY ARM BEING NERVED AND MY HEART INSPIRED BY HER HOW I WAS ALREADY WORKING WITH A COURAGE SUCH AS NONE BUT LOVERS KNEW HOW I HAD BEGUN TO BE PRACTICAL AND LOOK INTO THE FUTURE HOW A CRUST WELL EARNED WAS SWEETER FAR THAN A FEAST INHERITED AND MUCH MORE TO THE SAME PURPOSE WHICH I DELIVERED IN A BURST OF PASSIONATE ELOQUENCE QUITE SURPRISING TO MYSELF THOUGH I HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT DAY AND NIGHT EVER SINCE MY AUNT HAD ASTONISHED ME IS YOUR HEART MINE STILL DEAR DORA SAID I RAPTUROUSLY FOR I KNEW BY HER CLINGING TO ME THAT IT WAS OH YES CRIED DORA OH YES

DONT WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT CRUSTS SAID DORA AND JIP MUST HAVE A MUTTONCHOP EVERY DAY AT TWELVE OR HELL DIE I WAS CHARMED WITH HER CHILDISH WINNING WAY I FONDLY EXPLAINED TO DORA THAT JIP SHOULD HAVE HIS MUTTONCHOP WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED REGULARITY I DREW A PICTURE OF OUR FRUGAL HOME MADE INDEPENDENT BY MY LABOURSKETCHING IN THE LITTLE HOUSE I HAD SEEN AT HIGHGATE AND MY AUNT IN HER ROOM UPSTAIRS I AM NOT DREADFUL NOW DORA SAID I TENDERLY OH NO NO CRIED DORA BUT I HOPE YOUR AUNT WILL KEEP IN HER OWN ROOM A GOOD DEAL AND I HOPE SHES NOT A SCOLDING OLD THING IF IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO LOVE DORA MORE THAN EVER I AM SURE I DID BUT I FELT SHE WAS A LITTLE IMPRACTICABLE IT DAMPED MY NEWBORN ARDOUR TO FIND THAT ARDOUR SO DIFFICULT OF COMMUNICATION TO HER I MADE ANOTHER TRIAL WHEN SHE WAS QUITE HERSELF AGAIN AND WAS CURLING JIPS EARS AS HE LAY UPON HER LAP I BECAME GRAVE AND SAID MY OWN MAY I MENTION SOMETHING OH PLEASE DONT BE PRACTICAL SAID DORA COAXINGLY BECAUSE IT FRIGHTENS ME SO SWEETHEART I RETURNED THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM YOU IN ALL THIS I WANT YOU TO THINK OF IT QUITE DIFFERENTLY I WANT TO MAKE IT NERVE YOU AND INSPIRE YOU DORA OH BUT THATS SO SHOCKING CRIED DORA MY LOVE NO PERSEVERANCE AND STRENGTH OF CHARACTER WILL ENABLE US TO BEAR MUCH WORSE THINGS BUT I HAVENT GOT ANY STRENGTH AT ALL SAID DORA SHAKING HER CURLS HAVE I JIP OH DO KISS JIP AND BE AGREEABLE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST KISSING JIP WHEN SHE HELD HIM UP TO ME FOR THAT PURPOSE PUTTING HER OWN BRIGHT ROSY LITTLE MOUTH INTO KISSING FORM AS SHE DIRECTED THE OPERATION WHICH SHE INSISTED SHOULD BE PERFORMED SYMMETRICALLY ON THE CENTRE OF HIS NOSE I DID AS SHE BADE MEREWARDING MYSELF AFTERWARDS FOR MY OBEDIENCEAND SHE CHARMED ME OUT OF MY GRAVER CHARACTER FOR I DONT KNOW HOW LONG BUT DORA MY BELOVED SAID I AT LAST RESUMING IT I WAS GOING TO MENTION SOMETHING THE JUDGE OF THE PREROGATIVE COURT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER TO SEE HER FOLD HER LITTLE HANDS AND HOLD THEM UP BEGGING AND PRAYING ME NOT TO BE DREADFUL ANY MORE INDEED I AM NOT GOING TO BE MY DARLING I ASSURED HER BUT DORA MY LOVE IF YOU WILL SOMETIMES THINKNOT DESPONDINGLY YOU KNOW FAR FROM THATBUT IF YOU WILL SOMETIMES THINKJUST TO ENCOURAGE YOURSELFTHAT YOU ARE ENGAGED TO A POOR MAN DONT DONT PRAY DONT CRIED DORA ITS SO VERY DREADFUL MY SOUL NOT AT ALL SAID I CHEERFULLY IF YOU WILL SOMETIMES THINK OF THAT AND LOOK ABOUT NOW AND THEN AT YOUR PAPAS HOUSEKEEPING AND ENDEAVOUR TO ACQUIRE A LITTLE HABITOF ACCOUNTS FOR INSTANCE POOR LITTLE DORA RECEIVED THIS SUGGESTION WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS HALF A SOB AND HALF A SCREAM IT WOULD BE SO USEFUL TO US AFTERWARDS I WENT ON AND IF YOU WOULD PROMISE ME TO READ A LITTLEA LITTLE COOKERY BOOK THAT I WOULD SEND YOU IT WOULD BE SO EXCELLENT FOR BOTH OF US FOR OUR PATH IN LIFE MY DORA SAID I WARMING WITH THE SUBJECT IS STONY AND RUGGED NOW AND IT RESTS WITH US TO SMOOTH IT WE MUST FIGHT OUR WAY ONWARD WE MUST BE BRAVE THERE ARE OBSTACLES TO BE MET AND WE MUST MEET AND CRUSH THEM I WAS GOING ON AT A GREAT RATE WITH A CLENCHED HAND AND A MOST ENTHUSIASTIC COUNTENANCE BUT IT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY TO PROCEED I HAD SAID ENOUGH I HAD DONE IT AGAIN OH SHE WAS SO FRIGHTENED OH WHERE WAS JULIA MILLS OH TAKE HER TO JULIA MILLS AND GO AWAY PLEASE SO THAT IN SHORT I WAS QUITE DISTRACTED AND RAVED ABOUT THE DRAWINGROOM I THOUGHT I HAD KILLED HER THIS TIME I SPRINKLED WATER ON HER FACE I WENT DOWN ON MY KNEES I PLUCKED AT MY HAIR I DENOUNCED MYSELF AS A REMORSELESS BRUTE AND A RUTHLESS BEAST I IMPLORED HER FORGIVENESS I BESOUGHT HER TO LOOK UP I RAVAGED MISS MILLSS WORKBOX FOR A SMELLINGBOTTLE AND IN MY AGONY OF MIND APPLIED AN IVORY NEEDLECASE INSTEAD AND DROPPED ALL THE NEEDLES OVER DORA I SHOOK MY FISTS AT JIP WHO WAS AS FRANTIC AS MYSELF I DID EVERY WILD EXTRAVAGANCE THAT COULD BE DONE AND WAS A LONG WAY BEYOND THE END OF MY WITS WHEN MISS MILLS CAME INTO THE ROOM WHO HAS DONE THIS EXCLAIMED MISS MILLS SUCCOURING HER FRIEND I REPLIED I MISS MILLS I HAVE DONE IT BEHOLD THE DESTROYEROR WORDS TO THAT EFFECTAND HID MY FACE FROM THE LIGHT IN THE SOFA CUSHION AT FIRST MISS MILLS THOUGHT IT WAS A QUARREL AND THAT WE WERE VERGING ON THE DESERT OF SAHARA BUT SHE SOON FOUND OUT HOW MATTERS STOOD FOR MY DEAR AFFECTIONATE LITTLE DORA EMBRACING HER BEGAN EXCLAIMING THAT I WAS A POOR LABOURER AND THEN CRIED FOR ME AND EMBRACED ME AND ASKED ME WOULD I LET HER GIVE ME ALL HER MONEY TO KEEP AND THEN FELL ON MISS MILLSS NECK SOBBING AS IF HER TENDER HEART WERE BROKEN MISS MILLS MUST HAVE BEEN BORN TO BE A BLESSING TO US SHE ASCERTAINED FROM ME IN A FEW WORDS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT COMFORTED DORA AND GRADUALLY CONVINCED HER THAT I WAS NOT A LABOURERFROM MY MANNER OF STATING THE CASE I BELIEVE DORA CONCLUDED THAT I WAS A NAVIGATOR AND WENT BALANCING MYSELF UP AND DOWN A PLANK ALL DAY WITH A WHEELBARROWAND SO BROUGHT US TOGETHER IN PEACE WHEN WE WERE QUITE COMPOSED AND DORA HAD GONE UPSTAIRS TO PUT SOME ROSEWATER TO HER EYES MISS MILLS RANG FOR TEA IN THE ENSUING INTERVAL I TOLD MISS MILLS THAT SHE WAS EVERMORE MY FRIEND AND THAT MY HEART MUST CEASE TO VIBRATE ERE I COULD FORGET HER SYMPATHY I THEN EXPOUNDED TO MISS MILLS WHAT I HAD ENDEAVOURED SO VERY UNSUCCESSFULLY TO EXPOUND TO DORA MISS MILLS REPLIED ON GENERAL PRINCIPLES THAT THE COTTAGE OF CONTENT WAS BETTER THAN THE PALACE OF COLD SPLENDOUR AND THAT WHERE LOVE WAS ALL WAS I SAID TO MISS MILLS THAT THIS WAS VERY TRUE AND WHO SHOULD KNOW IT BETTER THAN I WHO LOVED DORA WITH A LOVE THAT NEVER MORTAL HAD EXPERIENCED YET BUT ON MISS MILLS OBSERVING WITH DESPONDENCY THAT IT WERE WELL INDEED FOR SOME HEARTS IF THIS WERE SO I EXPLAINED THAT I BEGGED LEAVE TO RESTRICT THE OBSERVATION TO MORTALS OF THE MASCULINE GENDER I THEN PUT IT TO MISS MILLS TO SAY WHETHER SHE CONSIDERED THAT THERE WAS OR WAS NOT ANY PRACTICAL MERIT IN THE SUGGESTION I HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO MAKE CONCERNING THE ACCOUNTS THE HOUSEKEEPING AND THE COOKERY BOOK MISS MILLS AFTER SOME CONSIDERATION THUS REPLIED MR COPPERFIELD I WILL BE PLAIN WITH YOU MENTAL SUFFERING AND TRIAL SUPPLY IN SOME NATURES THE PLACE OF YEARS AND I WILL BE AS PLAIN WITH YOU AS IF I WERE A LADY ABBESS NO THE SUGGESTION IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO OUR DORA OUR DEAREST DORA IS A FAVOURITE CHILD OF NATURE SHE IS A THING OF LIGHT AND AIRINESS AND JOY I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT IF IT COULD BE DONE IT MIGHT BE WELL BUT AND MISS MILLS SHOOK HER HEAD I WAS ENCOURAGED BY THIS CLOSING ADMISSION ON THE PART OF MISS MILLS TO ASK HER WHETHER FOR DORAS SAKE IF SHE HAD ANY OPPORTUNITY OF LURING HER ATTENTION TO SUCH PREPARATIONS FOR AN EARNEST LIFE SHE WOULD AVAIL HERSELF OF IT MISS MILLS REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE SO READILY THAT I FURTHER ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD TAKE CHARGE OF THE COOKERY BOOK AND IF SHE EVER COULD INSINUATE IT UPON DORAS ACCEPTANCE WITHOUT FRIGHTENING HER UNDERTAKE TO DO ME THAT CROWNING SERVICE MISS MILLS ACCEPTED THIS TRUST TOO BUT WAS NOT SANGUINE AND DORA RETURNED LOOKING SUCH A LOVELY LITTLE CREATURE THAT I REALLY DOUBTED WHETHER SHE OUGHT TO BE TROUBLED WITH ANYTHING SO ORDINARY AND SHE LOVED ME SO MUCH AND WAS SO CAPTIVATING PARTICULARLY WHEN SHE MADE JIP STAND ON HIS HIND LEGS FOR TOAST AND WHEN SHE PRETENDED TO HOLD THAT NOSE OF HIS AGAINST THE HOT TEAPOT FOR PUNISHMENT BECAUSE HE WOULDNT THAT I FELT LIKE A SORT OF MONSTER WHO HAD GOT INTO A FAIRYS BOWER WHEN I THOUGHT OF HAVING FRIGHTENED HER AND MADE HER CRY AFTER TEA WE HAD THE GUITAR AND DORA SANG THOSE SAME DEAR OLD FRENCH SONGS ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF EVER ON ANY ACCOUNT LEAVING OFF DANCING LA RA LA LA RA LA UNTIL I FELT A MUCH GREATER MONSTER THAN BEFORE WE HAD ONLY ONE CHECK TO OUR PLEASURE AND THAT HAPPENED A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE I TOOK MY LEAVE WHEN MISS MILLS CHANCING TO MAKE SOME ALLUSION TO TOMORROW MORNING I UNLUCKILY LET OUT THAT BEING OBLIGED TO EXERT MYSELF NOW I GOT UP AT FIVE OCLOCK WHETHER DORA HAD ANY IDEA THAT I WAS A PRIVATE WATCHMAN I AM UNABLE TO SAY BUT IT MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION ON HER AND SHE NEITHER PLAYED NOR SANG ANY MORE IT WAS STILL ON HER MIND WHEN I BADE HER ADIEU AND SHE SAID TO ME IN HER PRETTY COAXING WAYAS IF I WERE A DOLL I USED TO THINK NOW DONT GET UP AT FIVE OCLOCK YOU NAUGHTY BOY ITS SO NONSENSICAL MY LOVE SAID I I HAVE WORK TO DO BUT DONT DO IT RETURNED DORA WHY SHOULD YOU IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY TO THAT SWEET LITTLE SURPRISED FACE OTHERWISE THAN LIGHTLY AND PLAYFULLY THAT WE MUST WORK TO LIVE OH HOW RIDICULOUS CRIED DORA HOW SHALL WE LIVE WITHOUT DORA SAID I HOW ANY HOW SAID DORA SHE SEEMED TO THINK SHE HAD QUITE SETTLED THE QUESTION AND GAVE ME SUCH A TRIUMPHANT LITTLE KISS DIRECT FROM HER INNOCENT HEART THAT I WOULD HARDLY HAVE PUT HER OUT OF CONCEIT WITH HER ANSWER FOR A FORTUNE WELL I LOVED HER AND I WENT ON LOVING HER MOST ABSORBINGLY ENTIRELY AND COMPLETELY BUT GOING ON TOO WORKING PRETTY HARD AND BUSILY KEEPING REDHOT ALL THE IRONS I NOW HAD IN THE FIRE I WOULD SIT SOMETIMES OF A NIGHT OPPOSITE MY AUNT THINKING HOW I HAD FRIGHTENED DORA THAT TIME AND HOW I COULD BEST MAKE MY WAY WITH A GUITARCASE THROUGH THE FOREST OF DIFFICULTY UNTIL I USED TO FANCY THAT MY HEAD WAS TURNING QUITE GREY CHAPTER A DISSOLUTION OF PARTNERSHIP I DID NOT ALLOW MY RESOLUTION WITH RESPECT TO THE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES TO COOL IT WAS ONE OF THE IRONS I BEGAN TO HEAT IMMEDIATELY AND ONE OF THE IRONS I KEPT HOT AND HAMMERED AT WITH A PERSEVERANCE I MAY HONESTLY ADMIRE I BOUGHT AN APPROVED SCHEME OF THE NOBLE ART AND MYSTERY OF STENOGRAPHY WHICH COST ME TEN AND SIXPENCE AND PLUNGED INTO A SEA OF PERPLEXITY THAT BROUGHT ME IN A FEW WEEKS TO THE CONFINES OF DISTRACTION THE CHANGES THAT WERE RUNG UPON DOTS WHICH IN SUCH A POSITION MEANT SUCH A THING AND IN SUCH ANOTHER POSITION SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THE WONDERFUL VAGARIES THAT WERE PLAYED BY CIRCLES THE UNACCOUNTABLE CONSEQUENCES THAT RESULTED FROM MARKS LIKE FLIES LEGS THE TREMENDOUS EFFECTS OF A CURVE IN A WRONG PLACE NOT ONLY TROUBLED MY WAKING HOURS BUT REAPPEARED BEFORE ME IN MY SLEEP WHEN I HAD GROPED MY WAY BLINDLY THROUGH THESE DIFFICULTIES AND HAD MASTERED THE ALPHABET WHICH WAS AN EGYPTIAN TEMPLE IN ITSELF THERE THEN APPEARED A PROCESSION OF NEW HORRORS CALLED ARBITRARY CHARACTERS THE MOST DESPOTIC CHARACTERS I HAVE EVER KNOWN WHO INSISTED FOR INSTANCE THAT A THING LIKE THE BEGINNING OF A COBWEB MEANT EXPECTATION AND THAT A PENANDINK SKYROCKET STOOD FOR DISADVANTAGEOUS WHEN I HAD FIXED THESE WRETCHES IN MY MIND I FOUND THAT THEY HAD DRIVEN EVERYTHING ELSE OUT OF IT THEN BEGINNING AGAIN I FORGOT THEM WHILE I WAS PICKING THEM UP I DROPPED THE OTHER FRAGMENTS OF THE SYSTEM IN SHORT IT WAS ALMOST HEARTBREAKING IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUITE HEARTBREAKING BUT FOR DORA WHO WAS THE STAY AND ANCHOR OF MY TEMPESTDRIVEN BARK EVERY SCRATCH IN THE SCHEME WAS A GNARLED OAK IN THE FOREST OF DIFFICULTY AND I WENT ON CUTTING THEM DOWN ONE AFTER ANOTHER WITH SUCH VIGOUR THAT IN THREE OR FOUR MONTHS I WAS IN A CONDITION TO MAKE AN EXPERIMENT ON ONE OF OUR CRACK SPEAKERS IN THE COMMONS SHALL I EVER FORGET HOW THE CRACK SPEAKER WALKED OFF FROM ME BEFORE I BEGAN AND LEFT MY IMBECILE PENCIL STAGGERING ABOUT THE PAPER AS IF IT WERE IN A FIT THIS WOULD NOT DO IT WAS QUITE CLEAR I WAS FLYING TOO HIGH AND SHOULD NEVER GET ON SO I RESORTED TO TRADDLES FOR ADVICE WHO SUGGESTED THAT HE SHOULD DICTATE SPEECHES TO ME AT A PACE AND WITH OCCASIONAL STOPPAGES ADAPTED TO MY WEAKNESS VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS FRIENDLY AID I ACCEPTED THE PROPOSAL AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT ALMOST EVERY NIGHT FOR A LONG TIME WE HAD A SORT OF PRIVATE PARLIAMENT IN BUCKINGHAM STREET AFTER I CAME HOME FROM THE DOCTORS I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE SUCH A PARLIAMENT ANYWHERE ELSE MY AUNT AND MR DICK REPRESENTED THE GOVERNMENT OR THE OPPOSITION AS THE CASE MIGHT BE AND TRADDLES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ENFIELDS SPEAKERS OR A VOLUME OF PARLIAMENTARY ORATIONS THUNDERED ASTONISHING INVECTIVES AGAINST THEM STANDING BY THE TABLE WITH HIS FINGER IN THE PAGE TO KEEP THE PLACE AND HIS RIGHT ARM FLOURISHING ABOVE HIS HEAD TRADDLES AS MR PITT MR FOX MR SHERIDAN MR BURKE LORD CASTLEREAGH VISCOUNT SIDMOUTH OR MR CANNING WOULD WORK HIMSELF INTO THE MOST VIOLENT HEATS AND DELIVER THE MOST WITHERING DENUNCIATIONS OF THE PROFLIGACY AND CORRUPTION OF MY AUNT AND MR DICK WHILE I USED TO SIT AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WITH MY NOTEBOOK ON MY KNEE FAGGING AFTER HIM WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND MAIN THE INCONSISTENCY AND RECKLESSNESS OF TRADDLES WERE NOT TO BE EXCEEDED BY ANY REAL POLITICIAN HE WAS FOR ANY DESCRIPTION OF POLICY IN THE COMPASS OF A WEEK AND NAILED ALL SORTS OF COLOURS TO EVERY DENOMINATION OF MAST MY AUNT LOOKING VERY LIKE AN IMMOVABLE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER WOULD OCCASIONALLY THROW IN AN INTERRUPTION OR TWO AS HEAR OR NO OR OH WHEN THE TEXT SEEMED TO REQUIRE IT WHICH WAS ALWAYS A SIGNAL TO MR DICK A PERFECT COUNTRY GENTLEMAN TO FOLLOW LUSTILY WITH THE SAME CRY BUT MR DICK GOT TAXED WITH SUCH THINGS IN THE COURSE OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY CAREER AND WAS MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH AWFUL CONSEQUENCES THAT HE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE IN HIS MIND SOMETIMES I BELIEVE HE ACTUALLY BEGAN TO BE AFRAID HE REALLY HAD BEEN DOING SOMETHING TENDING TO THE ANNIHILATION OF THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AND THE RUIN OF THE COUNTRY OFTEN AND OFTEN WE PURSUED THESE DEBATES UNTIL THE CLOCK POINTED TO MIDNIGHT AND THE CANDLES WERE BURNING DOWN THE RESULT OF SO MUCH GOOD PRACTICE WAS THAT BY AND BY I BEGAN TO KEEP PACE WITH TRADDLES PRETTY WELL AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE TRIUMPHANT IF I HAD HAD THE LEAST IDEA WHAT MY NOTES WERE ABOUT BUT AS TO READING THEM AFTER I HAD GOT THEM I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE COPIED THE CHINESE INSCRIPTIONS OF AN IMMENSE COLLECTION OF TEACHESTS OR THE GOLDEN CHARACTERS ON ALL THE GREAT RED AND GREEN BOTTLES IN THE CHEMISTS SHOPS THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO TURN BACK AND BEGIN ALL OVER AGAIN IT WAS VERY HARD BUT I TURNED BACK THOUGH WITH A HEAVY HEART AND BEGAN LABORIOUSLY AND METHODICALLY TO PLOD OVER THE SAME TEDIOUS GROUND AT A SNAILS PACE STOPPING TO EXAMINE MINUTELY EVERY SPECK IN THE WAY ON ALL SIDES AND MAKING THE MOST DESPERATE EFFORTS TO KNOW THESE ELUSIVE CHARACTERS BY SIGHT WHEREVER I MET THEM I WAS ALWAYS PUNCTUAL AT THE OFFICE AT THE DOCTORS TOO AND I REALLY DID WORK AS THE COMMON EXPRESSION IS LIKE A CARTHORSE ONE DAY WHEN I WENT TO THE COMMONS AS USUAL I FOUND MR SPENLOW IN THE DOORWAY LOOKING EXTREMELY GRAVE AND TALKING TO HIMSELF AS HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMPLAINING OF PAINS IN HIS HEADHE HAD NATURALLY A SHORT THROAT AND I DO SERIOUSLY BELIEVE HE OVERSTARCHED HIMSELFI WAS AT FIRST ALARMED BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS NOT QUITE RIGHT IN THAT DIRECTION BUT HE SOON RELIEVED MY UNEASINESS INSTEAD OF RETURNING MY GOOD MORNING WITH HIS USUAL AFFABILITY HE LOOKED AT ME IN A DISTANT CEREMONIOUS MANNER AND COLDLY REQUESTED ME TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO A CERTAIN COFFEEHOUSE WHICH IN THOSE DAYS HAD A DOOR OPENING INTO THE COMMONS JUST WITHIN THE LITTLE ARCHWAY IN ST PAULS CHURCHYARD I COMPLIED IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE STATE AND WITH A WARM SHOOTING ALL OVER ME AS IF MY APPREHENSIONS WERE BREAKING OUT INTO BUDS WHEN I ALLOWED HIM TO GO ON A LITTLE BEFORE ON ACCOUNT OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE WAY I OBSERVED THAT HE CARRIED HIS HEAD WITH A LOFTY AIR THAT WAS PARTICULARLY UNPROMISING AND MY MIND MISGAVE ME THAT HE HAD FOUND OUT ABOUT MY DARLING DORA IF I HAD NOT GUESSED THIS ON THE WAY TO THE COFFEEHOUSE I COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER WHEN I FOLLOWED HIM INTO AN UPSTAIRS ROOM AND FOUND MISS MURDSTONE THERE SUPPORTED BY A BACKGROUND OF SIDEBOARD ON WHICH WERE SEVERAL INVERTED TUMBLERS SUSTAINING LEMONS AND TWO OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY BOXES ALL CORNERS AND FLUTINGS FOR STICKING KNIVES AND FORKS IN WHICH HAPPILY FOR MANKIND ARE NOW OBSOLETE MISS MURDSTONE GAVE ME HER CHILLY FINGERNAILS AND SAT SEVERELY RIGID MR SPENLOW SHUT THE DOOR MOTIONED ME TO A CHAIR AND STOOD ON THE HEARTHRUG IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW MR COPPERFIELD SAID MR SPENLOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR RETICULE MISS MURDSTONE I BELIEVE IT WAS THE OLD IDENTICAL STEELCLASPED RETICULE OF MY CHILDHOOD THAT SHUT UP LIKE A BITE COMPRESSING HER LIPS IN SYMPATHY WITH THE SNAP MISS MURDSTONE OPENED ITOPENING HER MOUTH A LITTLE AT THE SAME TIMEAND PRODUCED MY LAST LETTER TO DORA TEEMING WITH EXPRESSIONS OF DEVOTED AFFECTION I BELIEVE THAT IS YOUR WRITING MR COPPERFIELD SAID MR SPENLOW I WAS VERY HOT AND THE VOICE I HEARD WAS VERY UNLIKE MINE WHEN I SAID IT IS SIR IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN SAID MR SPENLOW AS MISS MURDSTONE BROUGHT A PARCEL OF LETTERS OUT OF HER RETICULE TIED ROUND WITH THE DEAREST BIT OF BLUE RIBBON THOSE ARE ALSO FROM YOUR PEN MR COPPERFIELD I TOOK THEM FROM HER WITH A MOST DESOLATE SENSATION AND GLANCING AT SUCH PHRASES AT THE TOP AS MY EVER DEAREST AND OWN DORA MY BEST BELOVED ANGEL MY BLESSED ONE FOR EVER AND THE LIKE BLUSHED DEEPLY AND INCLINED MY HEAD NO THANK YOU SAID MR SPENLOW COLDLY AS I MECHANICALLY OFFERED THEM BACK TO HIM I WILL NOT DEPRIVE YOU OF THEM MISS MURDSTONE BE SO GOOD AS TO PROCEED THAT GENTLE CREATURE AFTER A MOMENTS THOUGHTFUL SURVEY OF THE CARPET DELIVERED HERSELF WITH MUCH DRY UNCTION AS FOLLOWS I MUST CONFESS TO HAVING ENTERTAINED MY SUSPICIONS OF MISS SPENLOW IN REFERENCE TO DAVID COPPERFIELD FOR SOME TIME I OBSERVED MISS SPENLOW AND DAVID COPPERFIELD WHEN THEY FIRST MET AND THE IMPRESSION MADE UPON ME THEN WAS NOT AGREEABLE THE DEPRAVITY OF THE HUMAN HEART IS SUCH YOU WILL OBLIGE ME MAAM INTERRUPTED MR SPENLOW BY CONFINING YOURSELF TO FACTS MISS MURDSTONE CAST DOWN HER EYES SHOOK HER HEAD AS IF PROTESTING AGAINST THIS UNSEEMLY INTERRUPTION AND WITH FROWNING DIGNITY RESUMED SINCE I AM TO CONFINE MYSELF TO FACTS I WILL STATE THEM AS DRYLY AS I CAN PERHAPS THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED AN ACCEPTABLE COURSE OF PROCEEDING I HAVE ALREADY SAID SIR THAT I HAVE HAD MY SUSPICIONS OF MISS SPENLOW IN REFERENCE TO DAVID COPPERFIELD FOR SOME TIME I HAVE FREQUENTLY ENDEAVOURED TO FIND DECISIVE CORROBORATION OF THOSE SUSPICIONS BUT WITHOUT EFFECT I HAVE THEREFORE FORBORNE TO MENTION THEM TO MISS SPENLOWS FATHER LOOKING SEVERELY AT HIMKNOWING HOW LITTLE DISPOSITION THERE USUALLY IS IN SUCH CASES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONSCIENTIOUS DISCHARGE OF DUTY MR SPENLOW SEEMED QUITE COWED BY THE GENTLEMANLY STERNNESS OF MISS MURDSTONES MANNER AND DEPRECATED HER SEVERITY WITH A CONCILIATORY LITTLE WAVE OF HIS HAND ON MY RETURN TO NORWOOD AFTER THE PERIOD OF ABSENCE OCCASIONED BY MY BROTHERS MARRIAGE PURSUED MISS MURDSTONE IN A DISDAINFUL VOICE AND ON THE RETURN OF MISS SPENLOW FROM HER VISIT TO HER FRIEND MISS MILLS I IMAGINED THAT THE MANNER OF MISS SPENLOW GAVE ME GREATER OCCASION FOR SUSPICION THAN BEFORE THEREFORE I WATCHED MISS SPENLOW CLOSELY DEAR TENDER LITTLE DORA SO UNCONSCIOUS OF THIS DRAGONS EYE STILL RESUMED MISS MURDSTONE I FOUND NO PROOF UNTIL LAST NIGHT IT APPEARED TO ME THAT MISS SPENLOW RECEIVED TOO MANY LETTERS FROM HER FRIEND MISS MILLS BUT MISS MILLS BEING HER FRIEND WITH HER FATHERS FULL CONCURRENCE ANOTHER TELLING BLOW AT MR SPENLOW IT WAS NOT FOR ME TO INTERFERE IF I MAY NOT BE PERMITTED TO ALLUDE TO THE NATURAL DEPRAVITY OF THE HUMAN HEART AT LEAST I MAYI MUSTBE PERMITTED SO FAR TO REFER TO MISPLACED CONFIDENCE MR SPENLOW APOLOGETICALLY MURMURED HIS ASSENT LAST EVENING AFTER TEA PURSUED MISS MURDSTONE I OBSERVED THE LITTLE DOG STARTING ROLLING AND GROWLING ABOUT THE DRAWINGROOM WORRYING SOMETHING I SAID TO MISS SPENLOW DORA WHAT IS THAT THE DOG HAS IN HIS MOUTH ITS PAPER MISS SPENLOW IMMEDIATELY PUT HER HAND TO HER FROCK GAVE A SUDDEN CRY AND RAN TO THE DOG I INTERPOSED AND SAID DORA

JEWELLERYTHAT OF COURSE I PASS OVER THE LITTLE DOG RETREATED UNDER THE SOFA ON MY APPROACHING HIM AND WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY DISLODGED BY THE FIREIRONS EVEN WHEN DISLODGED HE STILL KEPT THE LETTER IN HIS MOUTH AND ON MY ENDEAVOURING TO TAKE IT FROM HIM AT THE IMMINENT RISK OF BEING BITTEN HE KEPT IT BETWEEN HIS TEETH SO PERTINACIOUSLY AS TO SUFFER HIMSELF TO BE HELD SUSPENDED IN THE AIR BY MEANS OF THE DOCUMENT AT LENGTH I OBTAINED POSSESSION OF IT AFTER PERUSING IT I TAXED MISS SPENLOW WITH HAVING MANY SUCH LETTERS IN HER POSSESSION AND ULTIMATELY OBTAINED FROM HER THE PACKET WHICH IS NOW IN DAVID COPPERFIELDS HAND HERE SHE CEASED AND SNAPPING HER RETICULE AGAIN AND SHUTTING HER MOUTH LOOKED AS IF SHE MIGHT BE BROKEN BUT COULD NEVER BE BENT YOU HAVE HEARD MISS MURDSTONE SAID MR

UPON HIS TOES AND HEELS ALTERNATELY MY SUITABLE PROVISION FOR MY CHILD TO BE INFLUENCED BY A PIECE OF YOUTHFUL FOLLY LIKE THE PRESENT IT IS MERE FOLLY MERE NONSENSE IN A LITTLE WHILE IT WILL WEIGH LIGHTER THAN ANY FEATHER BUT I MIGHTI MIGHTIF THIS SILLY BUSINESS WERE NOT COMPLETELY RELINQUISHED ALTOGETHER BE INDUCED IN SOME ANXIOUS MOMENT TO GUARD HER FROM AND SURROUND HER WITH PROTECTIONS AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY FOOLISH STEP IN THE WAY OF MARRIAGE NOW MR COPPERFIELD I HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT RENDER IT NECESSARY FOR ME TO OPEN EVEN FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THAT CLOSED PAGE IN THE BOOK OF LIFE AND UNSETTLE EVEN FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR GRAVE AFFAIRS LONG SINCE COMPOSED THERE WAS A SERENITY A TRANQUILLITY A CALM SUNSET AIR ABOUT HIM WHICH QUITE AFFECTED ME HE WAS SO PEACEFUL AND RESIGNEDCLEARLY HAD HIS AFFAIRS IN SUCH PERFECT TRAIN AND SO SYSTEMATICALLY WOUND UPTHAT HE WAS A MAN TO FEEL TOUCHED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF I REALLY THINK I SAW TEARS RISE TO HIS EYES FROM THE DEPTH OF HIS OWN FEELING OF ALL THIS BUT WHAT COULD I DO I COULD NOT DENY DORA AND MY OWN HEART WHEN HE TOLD ME I HAD BETTER TAKE A WEEK TO CONSIDER OF WHAT HE HAD SAID HOW COULD I SAY I WOULDNT TAKE A WEEK YET HOW COULD I FAIL TO KNOW THAT NO AMOUNT OF WEEKS COULD INFLUENCE SUCH LOVE AS MINE IN THE MEANTIME CONFER WITH MISS TROTWOOD OR WITH ANY PERSON WITH ANY KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE SAID MR SPENLOW ADJUSTING HIS CRAVAT WITH BOTH HANDS TAKE A WEEK MR COPPERFIELD I SUBMITTED AND WITH A COUNTENANCE AS EXPRESSIVE AS I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT OF DEJECTED AND DESPAIRING CONSTANCY CAME OUT OF THE ROOM MISS MURDSTONES HEAVY EYEBROWS FOLLOWED ME TO THE DOORI SAY HER EYEBROWS RATHER THAN HER EYES BECAUSE THEY WERE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IN HER FACEAND SHE LOOKED SO EXACTLY AS SHE USED TO LOOK AT ABOUT THAT HOUR OF THE MORNING IN OUR PARLOUR AT BLUNDERSTONE THAT I COULD HAVE FANCIED I HAD BEEN BREAKING DOWN IN MY LESSONS AGAIN AND THAT THE DEAD WEIGHT ON MY MIND WAS THAT HORRIBLE OLD SPELLINGBOOK WITH OVAL WOODCUTS SHAPED TO MY YOUTHFUL FANCY LIKE THE GLASSES OUT OF SPECTACLES WHEN I GOT TO THE OFFICE AND SHUTTING OUT OLD TIFFEY AND THE REST OF THEM WITH MY HANDS SAT AT MY DESK IN MY OWN PARTICULAR NOOK THINKING OF THIS EARTHQUAKE THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE SO UNEXPECTEDLY AND IN THE BITTERNESS OF MY SPIRIT CURSING JIP I FELL INTO SUCH A STATE OF TORMENT ABOUT DORA THAT I WONDER I DID NOT TAKE UP MY HAT AND RUSH INSANELY TO NORWOOD THE IDEA OF THEIR FRIGHTENING HER AND MAKING HER CRY AND OF MY NOT BEING THERE TO COMFORT HER WAS SO EXCRUCIATING THAT IT IMPELLED ME TO WRITE A WILD LETTER TO MR SPENLOW BESEECHING HIM NOT TO VISIT UPON HER THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY AWFUL DESTINY I IMPLORED HIM TO SPARE HER GENTLE NATURENOT TO CRUSH A FRAGILE FLOWERAND ADDRESSED HIM GENERALLY TO THE BEST OF MY REMEMBRANCE AS IF INSTEAD OF BEING HER FATHER HE HAD BEEN AN OGRE OR THE DRAGON OF WANTLEY THIS LETTER I SEALED AND LAID UPON HIS DESK BEFORE HE RETURNED AND WHEN HE CAME IN I SAW HIM THROUGH THE HALFOPENED DOOR OF HIS ROOM TAKE IT UP AND READ IT HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT ALL THE MORNING BUT BEFORE HE WENT AWAY IN THE AFTERNOON HE CALLED ME IN AND TOLD ME THAT I NEED NOT MAKE MYSELF AT ALL UNEASY ABOUT HIS DAUGHTERS HAPPINESS HE HAD ASSURED HER HE SAID THAT IT WAS ALL NONSENSE AND HE HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY TO HER HE BELIEVED HE WAS AN INDULGENT FATHER AS INDEED HE WAS AND I MIGHT SPARE MYSELF ANY SOLICITUDE ON HER ACCOUNT YOU MAY MAKE IT NECESSARY IF YOU ARE FOOLISH OR OBSTINATE MR COPPERFIELD HE OBSERVED FOR ME TO SEND MY DAUGHTER ABROAD AGAIN FOR A TERM BUT I HAVE A BETTER OPINION OF YOU I HOPE YOU WILL BE WISER THAN THAT IN A FEW DAYS AS TO MISS MURDSTONE FOR I HAD ALLUDED TO HER IN THE LETTER I RESPECT THAT LADYS VIGILANCE AND FEEL OBLIGED TO HER BUT SHE HAS STRICT CHARGE TO AVOID THE SUBJECT ALL I DESIRE MR COPPERFIELD IS THAT IT SHOULD BE FORGOTTEN ALL YOU HAVE GOT TO DO MR COPPERFIELD IS TO FORGET IT ALL IN THE NOTE I WROTE TO MISS MILLS I BITTERLY QUOTED THIS SENTIMENT ALL I HAD TO DO I SAID WITH GLOOMY SARCASM WAS TO FORGET DORA THAT WAS ALL AND WHAT WAS THAT I ENTREATED MISS MILLS TO SEE ME THAT EVENING IF IT COULD NOT BE DONE WITH MR MILLSS SANCTION AND CONCURRENCE I BESOUGHT A CLANDESTINE INTERVIEW IN THE BACK KITCHEN WHERE THE MANGLE WAS I INFORMED HER THAT MY REASON WAS TOTTERING ON ITS THRONE AND ONLY SHE MISS MILLS COULD PREVENT ITS BEING DEPOSED I SIGNED MYSELF HERS DISTRACTEDLY AND I COULDNT HELP FEELING WHILE I READ THIS COMPOSITION OVER BEFORE SENDING IT BY A PORTER THAT IT WAS SOMETHING IN THE STYLE OF MR MICAWBER HOWEVER I SENT IT AT NIGHT I REPAIRED TO MISS MILLSS STREET AND WALKED UP AND DOWN UNTIL I WAS STEALTHILY FETCHED IN BY MISS MILLSS MAID AND TAKEN THE AREA WAY TO THE BACK KITCHEN I HAVE SINCE SEEN REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ON EARTH TO PREVENT MY GOING IN AT THE FRONT DOOR AND BEING SHOWN UP INTO THE DRAWINGROOM EXCEPT MISS MILLSS LOVE OF THE ROMANTIC AND MYSTERIOUS IN THE BACK KITCHEN I RAVED AS BECAME ME I WENT THERE I SUPPOSE TO MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF AND I AM QUITE SURE I DID IT MISS MILLS HAD RECEIVED A HASTY NOTE FROM DORA TELLING HER THAT ALL WAS DISCOVERED AND SAYING OH PRAY COME TO ME JULIA DO DO BUT MISS MILLS MISTRUSTING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF HER PRESENCE TO THE HIGHER POWERS HAD NOT YET GONE AND WE WERE ALL BENIGHTED IN THE DESERT OF SAHARA MISS MILLS HAD A WONDERFUL FLOW OF WORDS AND LIKED TO POUR THEM OUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING THOUGH SHE MINGLED HER TEARS WITH MINE THAT SHE HAD A DREADFUL LUXURY IN OUR AFFLICTIONS SHE PETTED THEM AS I MAY SAY AND MADE THE MOST OF THEM A DEEP GULF SHE OBSERVED HAD OPENED BETWEEN DORA AND ME AND LOVE COULD ONLY SPAN IT WITH ITS RAINBOW LOVE MUST SUFFER IN THIS STERN WORLD IT EVER HAD BEEN SO IT EVER WOULD BE SO NO MATTER MISS MILLS REMARKED HEARTS CONFINED BY COBWEBS WOULD BURST AT LAST AND THEN LOVE WAS AVENGED THIS WAS SMALL CONSOLATION BUT MISS MILLS WOULDNT ENCOURAGE FALLACIOUS HOPES SHE MADE ME MUCH MORE WRETCHED THAN I WAS BEFORE AND I FELT AND TOLD HER WITH THE DEEPEST GRATITUDE THAT SHE WAS INDEED A FRIEND WE RESOLVED THAT SHE SHOULD GO TO DORA THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND FIND SOME MEANS OF ASSURING HER EITHER BY LOOKS OR WORDS OF MY DEVOTION AND MISERY WE PARTED OVERWHELMED WITH GRIEF AND I THINK MISS MILLS ENJOYED HERSELF COMPLETELY I CONFIDED ALL TO MY AUNT WHEN I GOT HOME AND IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY TO ME WENT TO BED DESPAIRING I GOT UP DESPAIRING AND WENT OUT DESPAIRING IT WAS SATURDAY MORNING AND I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE COMMONS I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF OUR OFFICEDOOR TO SEE THE TICKETPORTERS STANDING OUTSIDE TALKING TOGETHER AND SOME HALFDOZEN STRAGGLERS GAZING AT THE WINDOWS WHICH WERE SHUT UP I QUICKENED MY PACE AND PASSING AMONG THEM WONDERING AT THEIR LOOKS WENT HURRIEDLY IN THE CLERKS WERE THERE BUT NOBODY WAS DOING ANYTHING OLD TIFFEY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE I SHOULD THINK WAS SITTING ON SOMEBODY ELSES STOOL AND HAD NOT HUNG UP HIS HAT THIS IS A DREADFUL CALAMITY MR COPPERFIELD SAID HE AS I ENTERED WHAT IS I EXCLAIMED WHATS THE MATTER DONT YOU KNOW CRIED TIFFEY AND ALL THE REST OF THEM COMING ROUND ME NO SAID I LOOKING FROM FACE TO FACE MR SPENLOW SAID TIFFEY WHAT ABOUT HIM DEAD I THOUGHT IT WAS THE OFFICE REELING AND NOT I AS ONE OF THE CLERKS CAUGHT HOLD OF ME THEY SAT ME DOWN IN A CHAIR UNTIED MY NECKCLOTH AND BROUGHT ME SOME WATER I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THIS TOOK ANY TIME DEAD SAID I HE DINED IN TOWN YESTERDAY AND DROVE DOWN IN THE PHAETON BY HIMSELF SAID TIFFEY HAVING SENT HIS OWN GROOM HOME BY THE COACH AS HE SOMETIMES DID YOU KNOW WELL THE PHAETON WENT HOME WITHOUT HIM THE HORSES STOPPED AT THE STABLEGATE THE MAN WENT OUT WITH A LANTERN NOBODY IN THE CARRIAGE HAD THEY RUN AWAY THEY WERE NOT HOT SAID TIFFEY PUTTING ON HIS GLASSES NO HOTTER I UNDERSTAND THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING DOWN AT THE USUAL PACE THE REINS WERE BROKEN BUT THEY HAD BEEN DRAGGING ON THE GROUND THE HOUSE WAS ROUSED UP DIRECTLY AND THREE OF THEM WENT OUT ALONG THE ROAD THEY FOUND HIM A MILE OFF MORE THAN A MILE OFF MR TIFFEY INTERPOSED A JUNIOR WAS IT I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT SAID TIFFEYMORE THAN A MILE OFFNOT FAR FROM THE CHURCHLYING PARTLY ON THE ROADSIDE AND PARTLY ON THE PATH UPON HIS FACE WHETHER HE FELL OUT IN A FIT OR GOT OUT FEELING ILL BEFORE THE FIT CAME ONOR EVEN WHETHER HE WAS QUITE DEAD THEN THOUGH THERE IS NO DOUBT HE WAS QUITE INSENSIBLENO ONE APPEARS TO KNOW IF HE BREATHED CERTAINLY HE NEVER SPOKE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE WAS GOT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT IT WAS QUITE USELESS I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE STATE OF MIND INTO WHICH I WAS THROWN BY THIS INTELLIGENCE THE SHOCK OF SUCH AN EVENT HAPPENING SO SUDDENLY AND HAPPENING TO ONE WITH WHOM I HAD BEEN IN ANY RESPECT AT VARIANCETHE APPALLING VACANCY IN THE ROOM HE HAD OCCUPIED SO LATELY WHERE HIS CHAIR AND TABLE SEEMED TO WAIT FOR HIM AND HIS HANDWRITING OF YESTERDAY WAS LIKE A GHOSTTHE INDEFINABLE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SEPARATING HIM FROM THE PLACE AND FEELING WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AS IF HE MIGHT COME INTHE LAZY HUSH AND REST THERE WAS IN THE OFFICE AND THE INSATIABLE RELISH WITH WHICH OUR PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT IT AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME IN AND OUT ALL DAY AND GORGED THEMSELVES WITH THE SUBJECTTHIS IS EASILY INTELLIGIBLE TO ANYONE WHAT I CANNOT DESCRIBE IS HOW IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF MY OWN HEART I HAD A LURKING JEALOUSY EVEN OF DEATH HOW I FELT AS IF ITS MIGHT WOULD PUSH ME FROM MY GROUND IN DORAS THOUGHTS HOW I WAS IN A GRUDGING WAY I HAVE NO WORDS FOR ENVIOUS OF HER GRIEF HOW IT MADE ME RESTLESS TO THINK OF HER WEEPING TO OTHERS OR BEING CONSOLED BY OTHERS HOW I HAD A GRASPING AVARICIOUS WISH TO SHUT OUT EVERYBODY FROM HER BUT MYSELF AND TO BE ALL IN ALL TO HER AT THAT UNSEASONABLE TIME OF ALL TIMES IN THE TROUBLE OF THIS STATE OF MINDNOT EXCLUSIVELY MY OWN I HOPE BUT KNOWN TO OTHERSI WENT DOWN TO NORWOOD THAT NIGHT AND FINDING FROM ONE OF THE SERVANTS WHEN I MADE MY INQUIRIES AT THE DOOR THAT MISS MILLS WAS THERE GOT MY AUNT TO DIRECT A LETTER TO HER WHICH I WROTE I DEPLORED THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF MR SPENLOW MOST SINCERELY AND SHED TEARS IN DOING SO I ENTREATED HER TO TELL DORA IF DORA WERE IN A STATE TO HEAR IT THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO ME WITH THE UTMOST KINDNESS AND CONSIDERATION AND HAD COUPLED NOTHING BUT TENDERNESS NOT A SINGLE OR REPROACHFUL WORD WITH HER NAME I KNOW I DID THIS SELFISHLY TO HAVE MY NAME BROUGHT BEFORE HER BUT I TRIED TO BELIEVE IT WAS AN ACT OF JUSTICE TO HIS MEMORY PERHAPS I DID BELIEVE IT MY AUNT RECEIVED A FEW LINES NEXT DAY IN REPLY ADDRESSED OUTSIDE TO HER WITHIN TO ME DORA WAS OVERCOME BY GRIEF AND WHEN HER FRIEND HAD ASKED HER SHOULD SHE SEND HER LOVE TO ME HAD ONLY CRIED AS SHE WAS ALWAYS CRYING OH DEAR PAPA OH POOR PAPA BUT SHE HAD NOT SAID NO AND THAT I MADE THE MOST OF MR JORKINS WHO HAD BEEN AT NORWOOD SINCE THE OCCURRENCE CAME TO THE OFFICE A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS HE AND TIFFEY WERE CLOSETED TOGETHER FOR SOME FEW MOMENTS AND THEN TIFFEY LOOKED OUT AT THE DOOR AND BECKONED ME IN OH SAID MR JORKINS MR TIFFEY AND MYSELF MR COPPERFIELD ARE ABOUT TO EXAMINE THE DESKS THE DRAWERS AND OTHER SUCH REPOSITORIES OF THE DECEASED WITH THE VIEW OF SEALING UP HIS PRIVATE PAPERS AND SEARCHING FOR A WILL THERE IS NO TRACE OF ANY ELSEWHERE IT MAY BE AS WELL FOR YOU TO ASSIST US IF YOU PLEASE I HAD BEEN IN AGONY TO OBTAIN SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH MY DORA WOULD BE PLACEDAS IN WHOSE GUARDIANSHIP AND SO FORTHAND THIS WAS SOMETHING TOWARDS IT WE BEGAN THE SEARCH AT ONCE MR JORKINS UNLOCKING THE DRAWERS AND DESKS AND WE ALL TAKING OUT THE PAPERS THE OFFICEPAPERS WE PLACED ON ONE SIDE AND THE PRIVATE PAPERS WHICH WERE NOT NUMEROUS ON THE OTHER WE WERE VERY GRAVE AND WHEN WE CAME TO A STRAY SEAL OR PENCILCASE OR RING OR ANY LITTLE ARTICLE OF THAT KIND WHICH WE ASSOCIATED PERSONALLY WITH HIM WE SPOKE VERY LOW WE HAD SEALED UP SEVERAL PACKETS AND WERE STILL GOING ON DUSTILY AND QUIETLY WHEN MR JORKINS SAID TO US APPLYING EXACTLY THE SAME WORDS TO HIS LATE PARTNER AS HIS LATE PARTNER HAD APPLIED TO HIM MR SPENLOW WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE FROM THE BEATEN TRACK YOU KNOW WHAT HE WAS I AM DISPOSED TO THINK HE HAD MADE NO WILL OH I KNOW HE HAD SAID I THEY BOTH STOPPED AND LOOKED AT ME ON THE VERY DAY WHEN I LAST SAW HIM SAID I HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD AND THAT HIS AFFAIRS WERE LONG SINCE SETTLED MR JORKINS AND OLD TIFFEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS WITH ONE ACCORD THAT LOOKS UNPROMISING SAID TIFFEY VERY UNPROMISING SAID MR JORKINS SURELY YOU DONT DOUBT I BEGAN MY GOOD MR COPPERFIELD SAID TIFFEY LAYING HIS HAND UPON MY ARM AND SHUTTING UP BOTH HIS EYES AS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD IF YOU HAD BEEN IN THE COMMONS AS LONG AS I HAVE YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS NO SUBJECT ON WHICH MEN ARE SO INCONSISTENT AND SO LITTLE TO BE TRUSTED WHY BLESS MY SOUL HE MADE THAT VERY REMARK I REPLIED PERSISTENTLY I SHOULD CALL THAT ALMOST FINAL OBSERVED TIFFEY MY OPINION ISNO WILL IT APPEARED A WONDERFUL THING TO ME BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT THERE WAS NO WILL HE HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS THOUGHT OF MAKING ONE SO FAR AS HIS PAPERS AFFORDED ANY EVIDENCE FOR THERE WAS NO KIND OF HINT SKETCH OR MEMORANDUM OF ANY TESTAMENTARY INTENTION WHATEVER WHAT WAS SCARCELY LESS ASTONISHING TO ME WAS THAT HIS AFFAIRS WERE IN A MOST DISORDERED STATE IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT I HEARD TO MAKE OUT WHAT HE OWED OR WHAT HE HAD PAID OR OF WHAT HE DIED POSSESSED IT WAS CONSIDERED LIKELY THAT FOR YEARS HE COULD HAVE HAD NO CLEAR OPINION ON THESE SUBJECTS HIMSELF BY LITTLE AND LITTLE IT CAME OUT THAT IN THE COMPETITION ON ALL POINTS OF APPEARANCE AND GENTILITY THEN RUNNING HIGH IN THE COMMONS HE HAD SPENT MORE THAN HIS PROFESSIONAL INCOME WHICH WAS NOT A VERY LARGE ONE AND HAD REDUCED HIS PRIVATE MEANS IF THEY EVER HAD BEEN GREAT WHICH WAS EXCEEDINGLY DOUBTFUL TO A VERY LOW EBB INDEED THERE WAS A SALE OF THE FURNITURE AND LEASE AT NORWOOD AND TIFFEY TOLD ME LITTLE THINKING HOW INTERESTED I WAS IN THE STORY THAT PAYING ALL THE JUST DEBTS OF THE DECEASED AND DEDUCTING HIS SHARE OF OUTSTANDING BAD AND DOUBTFUL DEBTS DUE TO THE FIRM HE WOULDNT GIVE A THOUSAND POUNDS FOR ALL THE ASSETS REMAINING THIS WAS AT THE EXPIRATION OF ABOUT SIX WEEKS I HAD SUFFERED TORTURES ALL THE TIME AND THOUGHT I REALLY MUST HAVE LAID VIOLENT HANDS UPON MYSELF WHEN MISS MILLS STILL REPORTED TO ME THAT MY BROKENHEARTED LITTLE DORA WOULD SAY NOTHING WHEN I WAS MENTIONED BUT OH POOR PAPA OH DEAR PAPA ALSO THAT SHE HAD NO OTHER RELATIONS THAN TWO AUNTS MAIDEN SISTERS OF MR SPENLOW WHO LIVED AT PUTNEY AND WHO HAD NOT HELD ANY OTHER THAN CHANCE COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR BROTHER FOR MANY YEARS NOT THAT THEY HAD EVER QUARRELLED MISS MILLS INFORMED ME BUT THAT HAVING BEEN ON THE OCCASION OF DORAS CHRISTENING INVITED TO TEA WHEN THEY CONSIDERED THEMSELVES PRIVILEGED TO BE INVITED TO DINNER THEY HAD EXPRESSED THEIR OPINION IN WRITING THAT IT WAS BETTER FOR THE HAPPINESS OF ALL PARTIES THAT THEY SHOULD STAY AWAY SINCE WHICH THEY HAD GONE THEIR ROAD AND THEIR BROTHER HAD GONE HIS THESE TWO LADIES NOW EMERGED FROM THEIR RETIREMENT AND PROPOSED TO TAKE DORA TO LIVE AT PUTNEY DORA CLINGING TO THEM BOTH AND WEEPING EXCLAIMED O YES AUNTS PLEASE TAKE JULIA MILLS AND ME AND JIP TO PUTNEY SO THEY WENT VERY SOON AFTER THE FUNERAL HOW I FOUND TIME TO HAUNT PUTNEY I AM SURE I DONT KNOW BUT I CONTRIVED BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER TO PROWL ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD PRETTY OFTEN MISS MILLS FOR THE MORE EXACT DISCHARGE OF THE DUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP KEPT A JOURNAL AND SHE USED TO MEET ME SOMETIMES ON THE COMMON AND READ IT OR IF SHE HAD NOT TIME TO DO THAT LEND IT TO ME HOW I TREASURED UP THE ENTRIES OF WHICH I SUBJOIN A

SYMPATHETIC PAGESTO BE MADE MORE AND MORE MISERABLE BY HERWERE MY ONLY COMFORTS I FELT AS IF I HAD BEEN LIVING IN A PALACE OF CARDS WHICH HAD TUMBLED DOWN LEAVING ONLY MISS MILLS AND ME AMONG THE RUINS I FELT AS IF SOME GRIM ENCHANTER HAD DRAWN A MAGIC CIRCLE ROUND THE INNOCENT GODDESS OF MY HEART WHICH NOTHING INDEED BUT THOSE SAME STRONG PINIONS CAPABLE OF CARRYING SO MANY PEOPLE OVER SO MUCH WOULD ENABLE ME TO ENTER CHAPTER WICKFIELD AND HEEP MY AUNT BEGINNING I IMAGINE TO BE MADE SERIOUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE BY MY PROLONGED DEJECTION MADE A PRETENCE OF BEING ANXIOUS THAT I SHOULD GO TO DOVER TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WORKING WELL AT THE COTTAGE WHICH WAS LET AND TO CONCLUDE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE SAME TENANT FOR A LONGER TERM OF OCCUPATION JANET WAS DRAFTED INTO THE SERVICE OF MRS STRONG WHERE I SAW HER EVERY DAY SHE HAD BEEN UNDECIDED ON LEAVING DOVER WHETHER OR NO TO GIVE THE FINISHING TOUCH TO THAT RENUNCIATION OF MANKIND IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN EDUCATED BY MARRYING A PILOT BUT SHE DECIDED AGAINST THAT VENTURE NOT SO MUCH FOR THE SAKE OF PRINCIPLE I BELIEVE AS BECAUSE SHE HAPPENED NOT TO LIKE HIM ALTHOUGH IT REQUIRED AN EFFORT TO LEAVE MISS MILLS I FELL RATHER WILLINGLY INTO MY AUNTS PRETENCE AS A MEANS OF ENABLING ME TO PASS A FEW TRANQUIL HOURS WITH AGNES I CONSULTED THE GOOD DOCTOR RELATIVE TO AN ABSENCE OF THREE DAYS AND THE DOCTOR WISHING ME TO TAKE THAT RELAXATIONHE WISHED ME TO TAKE MORE BUT MY ENERGY COULD NOT BEAR THATI MADE UP MY MIND TO GO AS TO THE COMMONS I HAD NO GREAT OCCASION TO BE PARTICULAR ABOUT MY DUTIES IN THAT QUARTER TO SAY THE TRUTH WE WERE GETTING IN NO VERY GOOD ODOUR AMONG THE TIPTOP PROCTORS AND WERE RAPIDLY SLIDING DOWN TO BUT A DOUBTFUL POSITION THE BUSINESS HAD BEEN INDIFFERENT UNDER MR JORKINS BEFORE MR SPENLOWS TIME AND ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN QUICKENED BY THE INFUSION OF NEW BLOOD AND BY THE DISPLAY WHICH MR SPENLOW MADE STILL IT WAS NOT ESTABLISHED ON A SUFFICIENTLY STRONG BASIS TO BEAR WITHOUT BEING SHAKEN SUCH A BLOW AS THE SUDDEN LOSS OF ITS ACTIVE MANAGER IT FELL OFF VERY MUCH MR JORKINS NOTWITHSTANDING HIS REPUTATION IN THE FIRM WAS AN EASYGOING INCAPABLE SORT OF MAN WHOSE REPUTATION OUT OF DOORS WAS NOT CALCULATED TO BACK IT UP I WAS TURNED OVER TO HIM NOW AND WHEN I SAW HIM TAKE HIS SNUFF AND LET THE BUSINESS GO I REGRETTED MY AUNTS THOUSAND POUNDS MORE THAN EVER BUT THIS WAS NOT THE WORST OF IT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF HANGERSON AND OUTSIDERS ABOUT THE COMMONS WHO WITHOUT BEING PROCTORS THEMSELVES DABBLED IN COMMONFORM BUSINESS AND GOT IT DONE BY REAL PROCTORS WHO LENT THEIR NAMES IN CONSIDERATION OF A SHARE IN THE SPOILAND THERE WERE A GOOD MANY OF THESE TOO AS OUR HOUSE NOW WANTED BUSINESS ON ANY TERMS WE JOINED THIS NOBLE BAND AND THREW OUT LURES TO THE HANGERSON AND OUTSIDERS TO BRING THEIR BUSINESS TO US MARRIAGE LICENCES AND SMALL PROBATES WERE WHAT WE ALL LOOKED FOR AND WHAT PAID US BEST AND THE COMPETITION FOR THESE RAN VERY HIGH INDEED KIDNAPPERS AND INVEIGLERS WERE PLANTED IN ALL THE AVENUES OF ENTRANCE TO THE COMMONS WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO DO THEIR UTMOST TO CUT OFF ALL PERSONS IN MOURNING AND ALL GENTLEMEN WITH ANYTHING BASHFUL IN THEIR APPEARANCE AND ENTICE THEM TO THE OFFICES IN WHICH THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYERS WERE INTERESTED WHICH INSTRUCTIONS WERE SO WELL OBSERVED THAT I MYSELF BEFORE I WAS KNOWN BY SIGHT WAS TWICE HUSTLED INTO THE PREMISES OF OUR PRINCIPAL OPPONENT THE CONFLICTING INTERESTS OF THESE TOUTING GENTLEMEN BEING OF A NATURE TO IRRITATE THEIR FEELINGS PERSONAL COLLISIONS TOOK PLACE AND THE COMMONS WAS EVEN SCANDALIZED BY OUR PRINCIPAL INVEIGLER WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN IN THE WINE TRADE AND AFTERWARDS IN THE SWORN BROKERY LINE WALKING ABOUT FOR SOME DAYS WITH A BLACK EYE ANY ONE OF THESE SCOUTS USED TO THINK NOTHING OF POLITELY ASSISTING AN OLD LADY IN BLACK OUT OF A VEHICLE KILLING ANY PROCTOR WHOM SHE INQUIRED FOR REPRESENTING HIS EMPLOYER AS THE LAWFUL SUCCESSOR AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT PROCTOR AND BEARING THE OLD LADY OFF SOMETIMES GREATLY AFFECTED TO HIS EMPLOYERS OFFICE MANY CAPTIVES WERE BROUGHT TO ME IN THIS WAY AS TO MARRIAGE LICENCES THE COMPETITION ROSE TO SUCH A PITCH THAT A SHY GENTLEMAN IN WANT OF ONE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT SUBMIT HIMSELF TO THE FIRST INVEIGLER OR BE FOUGHT FOR AND BECOME THE PREY OF THE STRONGEST ONE OF OUR CLERKS WHO WAS AN OUTSIDER USED IN THE HEIGHT OF THIS CONTEST TO SIT WITH HIS HAT ON THAT HE MIGHT BE READY TO RUSH OUT AND SWEAR BEFORE A SURROGATE ANY VICTIM WHO WAS BROUGHT IN THE SYSTEM OF INVEIGLING CONTINUES I BELIEVE TO THIS DAY THE LAST TIME I WAS IN THE COMMONS A CIVIL ABLEBODIED PERSON IN A WHITE APRON POUNCED OUT UPON ME FROM A DOORWAY AND WHISPERING THE WORD MARRIAGELICENCE IN MY EAR WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PREVENTED FROM TAKING ME UP IN HIS ARMS AND LIFTING ME INTO A PROCTORS FROM THIS DIGRESSION LET ME PROCEED TO DOVER I FOUND EVERYTHING IN A SATISFACTORY STATE AT THE COTTAGE AND WAS ENABLED TO GRATIFY MY AUNT EXCEEDINGLY BY REPORTING THAT THE TENANT INHERITED HER FEUD AND WAGED INCESSANT WAR AGAINST DONKEYS HAVING SETTLED THE LITTLE BUSINESS I HAD TO TRANSACT THERE AND SLEPT THERE ONE NIGHT I WALKED ON TO CANTERBURY EARLY IN THE MORNING IT WAS NOW WINTER AGAIN AND THE FRESH COLD WINDY DAY AND THE SWEEPING DOWNLAND BRIGHTENED UP MY HOPES A LITTLE COMING INTO CANTERBURY I LOITERED THROUGH THE OLD STREETS WITH A SOBER PLEASURE THAT CALMED MY SPIRITS AND EASED MY HEART THERE WERE THE OLD SIGNS THE OLD NAMES OVER THE SHOPS THE OLD PEOPLE SERVING IN THEM IT APPEARED SO LONG SINCE I HAD BEEN A SCHOOLBOY THERE THAT I WONDERED THE PLACE WAS SO LITTLE CHANGED UNTIL I REFLECTED HOW LITTLE I WAS CHANGED MYSELF STRANGE TO SAY THAT QUIET INFLUENCE WHICH WAS INSEPARABLE IN MY MIND FROM AGNES SEEMED TO PERVADE EVEN THE CITY WHERE SHE DWELT THE VENERABLE CATHEDRAL TOWERS AND THE OLD JACKDAWS AND ROOKS WHOSE AIRY VOICES MADE THEM MORE RETIRED THAN PERFECT SILENCE WOULD HAVE DONE THE BATTERED GATEWAYS ONE STUCK FULL WITH STATUES LONG THROWN DOWN AND CRUMBLED AWAY LIKE THE REVERENTIAL PILGRIMS WHO HAD GAZED UPON THEM THE STILL NOOKS WHERE THE IVIED GROWTH OF CENTURIES CREPT OVER GABLED ENDS AND RUINED WALLS THE ANCIENT HOUSES THE PASTORAL LANDSCAPE OF FIELD ORCHARD AND GARDEN EVERYWHEREON EVERYTHINGI FELT THE SAME SERENER AIR THE SAME CALM THOUGHTFUL SOFTENING SPIRIT ARRIVED AT MR WICKFIELDS HOUSE I FOUND IN THE LITTLE LOWER ROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHERE URIAH HEEP HAD BEEN OF OLD ACCUSTOMED TO SIT MR MICAWBER PLYING HIS PEN WITH GREAT ASSIDUITY HE WAS DRESSED IN A LEGALLOOKING SUIT OF BLACK AND LOOMED BURLY AND LARGE IN THAT SMALL OFFICE MR MICAWBER WAS EXTREMELY GLAD TO SEE ME BUT A LITTLE CONFUSED TOO HE WOULD HAVE CONDUCTED ME IMMEDIATELY INTO THE PRESENCE OF URIAH BUT I DECLINED I KNOW THE HOUSE OF OLD YOU RECOLLECT SAID I AND WILL FIND MY WAY UPSTAIRS HOW DO YOU LIKE THE LAW MR MICAWBER MY DEAR COPPERFIELD HE REPLIED TO A MAN POSSESSED OF THE HIGHER IMAGINATIVE POWERS THE OBJECTION TO LEGAL STUDIES IS THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL WHICH THEY INVOLVE EVEN IN OUR PROFESSIONAL CORRESPONDENCE SAID MR MICAWBER GLANCING AT SOME LETTERS HE WAS WRITING THE MIND IS NOT AT LIBERTY TO SOAR TO ANY EXALTED FORM OF EXPRESSION STILL IT IS A GREAT PURSUIT A GREAT PURSUIT HE THEN TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BECOME THE TENANT OF URIAH HEEPS OLD HOUSE AND THAT MRS MICAWBER WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE ME ONCE MORE UNDER HER OWN ROOF IT IS HUMBLE SAID MR MICAWBER TO QUOTE A FAVOURITE EXPRESSION OF MY FRIEND HEEP BUT IT MAY PROVE THE STEPPINGSTONE TO MORE AMBITIOUS DOMICILIARY ACCOMMODATION I ASKED HIM WHETHER HE HAD REASON SO FAR TO BE SATISFIED WITH HIS FRIEND HEEPS TREATMENT OF HIM HE GOT UP TO ASCERTAIN IF THE DOOR WERE CLOSE SHUT BEFORE HE REPLIED IN A LOWER VOICE MY DEAR COPPERFIELD A MAN WHO LABOURS UNDER THE PRESSURE OF PECUNIARY EMBARRASSMENTS IS WITH THE GENERALITY OF PEOPLE AT A DISADVANTAGE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS NOT DIMINISHED WHEN THAT PRESSURE NECESSITATES THE DRAWING OF STIPENDIARY EMOLUMENTS BEFORE THOSE EMOLUMENTS ARE STRICTLY DUE AND PAYABLE ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT MY FRIEND HEEP HAS RESPONDED TO APPEALS TO WHICH I NEED NOT MORE PARTICULARLY REFER IN A MANNER CALCULATED TO REDOUND EQUALLY TO THE

THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING INTERPOSED BETWEEN HIM AND ME SINCE HE HAD COME INTO HIS NEW FUNCTIONS WHICH PREVENTED OUR GETTING AT EACH OTHER AS WE USED TO DO AND QUITE ALTERED THE CHARACTER OF OUR INTERCOURSE THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE QUAINT OLD DRAWINGROOM THOUGH IT PRESENTED TOKENS OF MRS HEEPS WHEREABOUTS I LOOKED INTO THE ROOM STILL BELONGING TO AGNES AND SAW HER SITTING BY THE FIRE AT A PRETTY OLDFASHIONED DESK SHE HAD WRITING MY DARKENING THE LIGHT MADE HER LOOK UP WHAT A PLEASURE TO BE THE CAUSE OF THAT BRIGHT CHANGE IN HER ATTENTIVE FACE AND THE OBJECT OF THAT SWEET REGARD AND WELCOME AH AGNES SAID I WHEN WE WERE SITTING TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE I HAVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH LATELY INDEED SHE REPLIED AGAIN AND SO SOON I SHOOK MY HEAD I DONT KNOW HOW IT IS AGNES I SEEM TO WANT SOME

LITTLE HESITATION YES RETURNED AGNES LAUGHING PRETTY WELL AND YET SAID I I GET SO MISERABLE AND WORRIED AND AM SO UNSTEADY AND IRRESOLUTE IN MY POWER OF ASSURING MYSELF THAT I KNOW I MUST WANTSHALL I

IN A MOMENT I FEEL AN ALTERED PERSON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DISTRESSED ME ARE NOT CHANGED SINCE I CAME INTO THIS ROOM BUT AN INFLUENCE COMES OVER ME IN THAT SHORT INTERVAL THAT ALTERS ME OH HOW MUCH FOR THE BETTER WHAT IS IT WHAT IS YOUR SECRET AGNES HER HEAD WAS BENT DOWN LOOKING AT THE FIRE ITS THE OLD STORY SAID I DONT LAUGH WHEN I SAY IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME IN LITTLE THINGS AS IT IS IN GREATER ONES MY OLD TROUBLES WERE NONSENSE AND NOW THEY ARE SERIOUS BUT WHENEVER I HAVE GONE AWAY FROM MY ADOPTED SISTER AGNES LOOKED UPWITH SUCH A HEAVENLY FACEAND GAVE ME HER HAND WHICH I KISSED WHENEVER I HAVE NOT HAD YOU AGNES TO ADVISE AND APPROVE IN THE BEGINNING I HAVE SEEMED TO GO WILD AND TO GET INTO ALL SORTS OF DIFFICULTY WHEN I HAVE COME TO YOU AT LAST AS I HAVE ALWAYS DONE I HAVE COME TO PEACE AND HAPPINESS I COME HOME NOW LIKE A TIRED TRAVELLER AND FIND SUCH A BLESSED SENSE OF REST I FELT SO DEEPLY WHAT I SAID IT AFFECTED ME SO SINCERELY THAT MY VOICE FAILED AND I COVERED MY FACE WITH MY HAND AND BROKE INTO TEARS I WRITE THE TRUTH WHATEVER CONTRADICTIONS AND INCONSISTENCIES THERE WERE WITHIN ME AS THERE ARE WITHIN SO MANY OF US WHATEVER MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO DIFFERENT AND SO MUCH BETTER WHATEVER I HAD DONE IN WHICH I HAD PERVERSELY WANDERED AWAY FROM THE VOICE OF MY OWN HEART I KNEW NOTHING OF I ONLY KNEW THAT I WAS FERVENTLY IN EARNEST WHEN I FELT THE REST AND PEACE OF HAVING AGNES NEAR ME IN HER PLACID SISTERLY MANNER WITH HER BEAMING EYES WITH HER TENDER VOICE AND WITH THAT SWEET COMPOSURE WHICH HAD LONG AGO MADE THE HOUSE THAT HELD HER QUITE A SACRED PLACE TO ME SHE SOON WON ME FROM THIS WEAKNESS AND LED ME ON TO TELL ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE OUR LAST MEETING AND THERE IS NOT ANOTHER WORD TO TELL AGNES SAID I WHEN I HAD MADE AN END OF MY CONFIDENCE NOW MY RELIANCE IS ON YOU BUT IT MUST NOT BE ON ME TROTWOOD RETURNED AGNES WITH A PLEASANT SMILE IT MUST BE ON SOMEONE ELSE ON DORA SAID I ASSUREDLY WHY I HAVE NOT MENTIONED AGNES SAID I A LITTLE EMBARRASSED THAT DORA IS RATHER DIFFICULT TOI WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD SAY TO RELY UPON BECAUSE SHE IS THE SOUL OF PURITY AND TRUTHBUT RATHER DIFFICULT TOI HARDLY KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS IT REALLY AGNES SHE IS A TIMID LITTLE THING AND EASILY DISTURBED AND FRIGHTENED SOME TIME AGO BEFORE HER FATHERS DEATH WHEN I THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO MENTION TO HERBUT ILL TELL YOU IF YOU WILL BEAR WITH ME HOW IT WAS ACCORDINGLY I TOLD AGNES ABOUT MY DECLARATION OF POVERTY ABOUT THE COOKERYBOOK THE HOUSEKEEPING ACCOUNTS AND ALL THE REST OF IT OH TROTWOOD SHE REMONSTRATED WITH A SMILE JUST YOUR OLD HEADLONG WAY YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN EARNEST IN STRIVING TO GET ON IN THE WORLD WITHOUT BEING SO VERY SUDDEN WITH A TIMID LOVING INEXPERIENCED GIRL POOR DORA I NEVER HEARD SUCH SWEET FORBEARING KINDNESS EXPRESSED IN A VOICE AS SHE EXPRESSED IN MAKING THIS REPLY IT WAS AS IF I HAD SEEN HER ADMIRINGLY AND TENDERLY EMBRACING DORA AND TACITLY REPROVING ME BY HER CONSIDERATE PROTECTION FOR MY HOT HASTE IN FLUTTERING THAT LITTLE HEART IT WAS AS IF I HAD SEEN DORA IN ALL HER FASCINATING ARTLESSNESS CARESSING AGNES AND THANKING HER AND COAXINGLY APPEALING AGAINST ME AND LOVING ME WITH ALL HER CHILDISH INNOCENCE I FELT SO GRATEFUL TO AGNES AND ADMIRED HER SO I SAW THOSE TWO TOGETHER IN A BRIGHT PERSPECTIVE SUCH WELLASSOCIATED FRIENDS EACH ADORNING THE OTHER SO MUCH WHAT OUGHT I TO DO THEN AGNES I INQUIRED AFTER LOOKING AT THE FIRE A LITTLE WHILE WHAT WOULD IT BE RIGHT TO DO I THINK SAID AGNES THAT THE HONOURABLE COURSE TO TAKE WOULD BE TO WRITE TO THOSE TWO LADIES DONT YOU THINK THAT ANY SECRET COURSE IS AN UNWORTHY ONE YES IF YOU THINK SO SAID I I AM POORLY QUALIFIED TO JUDGE OF SUCH MATTERS REPLIED AGNES WITH A MODEST HESITATION BUT I CERTAINLY FEELIN SHORT I FEEL THAT YOUR BEING SECRET AND CLANDESTINE IS NOT BEING LIKE YOURSELF LIKE MYSELF IN THE TOO HIGH OPINION YOU HAVE OF ME AGNES I AM AFRAID SAID I LIKE YOURSELF IN THE CANDOUR OF YOUR NATURE SHE RETURNED AND THEREFORE I WOULD WRITE TO THOSE TWO LADIES I WOULD RELATE AS PLAINLY AND AS OPENLY AS POSSIBLE ALL THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE AND I WOULD ASK THEIR PERMISSION TO VISIT SOMETIMES AT THEIR HOUSE CONSIDERING THAT YOU ARE YOUNG AND STRIVING FOR A PLACE IN LIFE I THINK IT WOULD BE WELL TO SAY THAT YOU WOULD READILY ABIDE BY ANY CONDITIONS THEY MIGHT IMPOSE UPON YOU I WOULD ENTREAT THEM NOT TO DISMISS YOUR REQUEST WITHOUT A REFERENCE TO DORA AND TO DISCUSS IT WITH HER WHEN THEY SHOULD THINK THE TIME SUITABLE I WOULD NOT BE TOO VEHEMENT SAID AGNES GENTLY OR PROPOSE TOO MUCH I WOULD TRUST TO MY FIDELITY AND PERSEVERANCEAND TO DORA BUT IF THEY WERE TO FRIGHTEN DORA AGAIN AGNES BY SPEAKING TO HER SAID I AND IF DORA WERE TO CRY AND SAY NOTHING ABOUT ME IS THAT LIKELY INQUIRED AGNES WITH THE SAME SWEET CONSIDERATION IN HER FACE GOD BLESS HER SHE IS AS EASILY SCARED AS A BIRD SAID I IT MIGHT BE OR IF THE TWO MISS SPENLOWS ELDERLY LADIES OF THAT SORT ARE ODD CHARACTERS SOMETIMES SHOULD NOT BE LIKELY PERSONS TO ADDRESS IN THAT WAY I DONT THINK TROTWOOD RETURNED AGNES RAISING HER SOFT EYES TO MINE I WOULD CONSIDER THAT PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER ONLY TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT IS RIGHT TO DO THIS AND IF IT IS TO DO IT I HAD NO LONGER ANY DOUBT ON THE SUBJECT WITH A LIGHTENED HEART THOUGH WITH A PROFOUND SENSE OF THE WEIGHTY IMPORTANCE OF MY TASK I DEVOTED THE WHOLE AFTERNOON TO THE COMPOSITION OF THE DRAFT OF THIS LETTER FOR WHICH GREAT PURPOSE AGNES RELINQUISHED HER DESK TO ME BUT FIRST I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO SEE MR WICKFIELD AND URIAH HEEP I FOUND URIAH IN POSSESSION OF A NEW PLASTERSMELLING OFFICE BUILT OUT IN THE GARDEN LOOKING EXTRAORDINARILY MEAN IN THE MIDST OF A QUANTITY OF BOOKS AND PAPERS HE RECEIVED ME IN HIS USUAL FAWNING WAY AND PRETENDED NOT TO HAVE HEARD OF MY ARRIVAL FROM MR MICAWBER A PRETENCE I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF DISBELIEVING HE ACCOMPANIED ME INTO MR WICKFIELDS ROOM WHICH WAS THE SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELFHAVING BEEN DIVESTED OF A VARIETY OF CONVENIENCES FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE NEW PARTNERAND STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE WARMING HIS BACK AND SHAVING HIS CHIN WITH HIS BONY HAND WHILE MR WICKFIELD AND I EXCHANGED GREETINGS YOU STAY WITH US TROTWOOD WHILE YOU REMAIN IN CANTERBURY SAID MR WICKFIELD NOT WITHOUT A GLANCE AT URIAH FOR HIS APPROVAL IS THERE ROOM FOR ME SAID I I AM SURE MASTER COPPERFIELDI SHOULD SAY MISTER BUT THE OTHER COMES SO NATURAL SAID URIAHI WOULD TURN OUT OF YOUR OLD ROOM WITH PLEASURE IF IT WOULD BE AGREEABLE NO NO SAID MR WICKFIELD WHY SHOULD YOU BE INCONVENIENCED THERES ANOTHER ROOM THERES ANOTHER ROOM OH BUT YOU KNOW RETURNED URIAH WITH A GRIN I SHOULD REALLY BE DELIGHTED TO CUT THE MATTER SHORT I SAID I WOULD HAVE THE OTHER ROOM OR NONE AT ALL SO IT WAS SETTLED THAT I SHOULD HAVE THE OTHER ROOM AND TAKING MY LEAVE OF THE FIRM UNTIL DINNER I WENT UPSTAIRS AGAIN I HAD HOPED TO HAVE NO OTHER COMPANION THAN AGNES BUT MRS HEEP HAD ASKED PERMISSION TO BRING HERSELF AND HER KNITTING NEAR THE FIRE IN THAT ROOM ON PRETENCE OF ITS HAVING AN ASPECT MORE FAVOURABLE FOR HER RHEUMATICS AS THE WIND THEN WAS THAN THE DRAWINGROOM OR DININGPARLOUR THOUGH I COULD ALMOST HAVE CONSIGNED HER TO THE MERCIES OF THE WIND ON THE TOPMOST PINNACLE OF THE CATHEDRAL

WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED YOU ARE TOO SOLICITOUS ABOUT HIM HE IS VERY WELL MRS HEEP WITH A PRODIGIOUS SNIFF RESUMED HER KNITTING SHE NEVER LEFT OFF OR LEFT US FOR A MOMENT I HAD ARRIVED EARLY IN THE DAY AND WE HAD STILL THREE OR FOUR HOURS BEFORE DINNER BUT SHE SAT THERE PLYING HER KNITTINGNEEDLES AS MONOTONOUSLY AS AN HOURGLASS MIGHT HAVE POURED OUT ITS SANDS SHE SAT ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIRE I SAT AT THE DESK IN FRONT OF IT A LITTLE BEYOND ME ON THE OTHER SIDE SAT AGNES WHENSOEVER SLOWLY PONDERING OVER MY LETTER I LIFTED UP MY EYES AND MEETING THE THOUGHTFUL FACE OF AGNES SAW IT CLEAR AND BEAM ENCOURAGEMENT UPON ME WITH ITS OWN ANGELIC EXPRESSION I WAS CONSCIOUS PRESENTLY OF THE EVIL EYE PASSING ME AND GOING ON TO HER AND COMING BACK TO ME AGAIN AND DROPPING FURTIVELY UPON THE KNITTING WHAT THE KNITTING WAS I DONT KNOW NOT BEING LEARNED IN THAT ART BUT IT LOOKED LIKE A NET AND AS SHE WORKED AWAY WITH THOSE CHINESE CHOPSTICKS OF KNITTINGNEEDLES SHE SHOWED IN THE FIRELIGHT LIKE AN ILLLOOKING ENCHANTRESS BAULKED AS YET BY THE RADIANT GOODNESS OPPOSITE BUT GETTING READY FOR A CAST OF HER NET BY AND BY AT DINNER SHE MAINTAINED HER WATCH WITH THE SAME UNWINKING EYES AFTER DINNER HER SON TOOK HIS TURN AND WHEN MR WICKFIELD HIMSELF AND I WERE LEFT ALONE TOGETHER LEERED AT ME AND WRITHED UNTIL I COULD HARDLY BEAR IT IN THE DRAWINGROOM THERE WAS THE MOTHER KNITTING AND WATCHING AGAIN ALL THE TIME THAT AGNES SANG AND PLAYED THE MOTHER SAT AT THE PIANO ONCE SHE ASKED FOR A PARTICULAR BALLAD WHICH SHE SAID HER URY WHO WAS YAWNING IN A GREAT CHAIR DOTED ON AND AT INTERVALS SHE LOOKED ROUND AT HIM AND REPORTED TO AGNES THAT HE WAS IN RAPTURES WITH THE MUSIC BUT SHE HARDLY EVER SPOKEI QUESTION IF SHE EVER DIDWITHOUT MAKING SOME MENTION OF HIM IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT THIS WAS THE DUTY ASSIGNED TO HER THIS LASTED UNTIL BEDTIME TO HAVE SEEN THE MOTHER AND SON LIKE TWO GREAT BATS HANGING OVER THE WHOLE HOUSE AND DARKENING IT WITH THEIR UGLY FORMS MADE ME SO UNCOMFORTABLE THAT I WOULD RATHER HAVE REMAINED DOWNSTAIRS KNITTING AND ALL THAN GONE TO BED I HARDLY GOT ANY SLEEP NEXT DAY THE KNITTING AND WATCHING BEGAN AGAIN AND LASTED ALL DAY I HAD NOT AN OPPORTUNITY OF SPEAKING TO AGNES FOR TEN MINUTES I COULD BARELY SHOW HER MY LETTER I PROPOSED TO HER TO WALK OUT WITH ME BUT MRS HEEP REPEATEDLY COMPLAINING THAT SHE WAS WORSE AGNES CHARITABLY REMAINED WITHIN TO

COMPREHENDED NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT A BASE UNRELENTING AND REVENGEFUL SPIRIT MUST HAVE BEEN ENGENDERED BY THIS EARLY AND THIS LONG SUPPRESSION HIS ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF WAS SO FAR ATTENDED WITH AN AGREEABLE RESULT THAT IT LED TO HIS WITHDRAWING HIS HAND IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER HUG OF HIMSELF UNDER THE CHIN ONCE APART FROM HIM I WAS DETERMINED TO KEEP APART AND WE WALKED BACK SIDE BY SIDE SAYING VERY LITTLE MORE BY THE WAY WHETHER HIS SPIRITS WERE ELEVATED BY THE COMMUNICATION I HAD MADE TO HIM OR BY HIS HAVING INDULGED IN THIS RETROSPECT I DONT KNOW BUT THEY WERE RAISED BY SOME INFLUENCE HE TALKED MORE AT DINNER THAN WAS USUAL WITH HIM ASKED HIS MOTHER OFF DUTY FROM THE MOMENT OF OUR REENTERING THE HOUSE WHETHER HE WAS NOT GROWING TOO OLD FOR A BACHELOR AND ONCE LOOKED AT AGNES SO THAT I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL I HAD FOR LEAVE TO KNOCK HIM DOWN WHEN WE THREE MALES WERE LEFT ALONE AFTER DINNER HE GOT INTO A MORE ADVENTUROUS STATE HE HAD TAKEN LITTLE OR NO WINE AND I PRESUME IT WAS THE MERE INSOLENCE OF TRIUMPH THAT WAS UPON HIM FLUSHED PERHAPS BY THE TEMPTATION MY PRESENCE FURNISHED TO ITS EXHIBITION I HAD OBSERVED YESTERDAY THAT HE TRIED TO ENTICE MR WICKFIELD TO DRINK AND INTERPRETING THE LOOK WHICH AGNES HAD GIVEN ME AS SHE WENT OUT HAD LIMITED MYSELF TO ONE GLASS AND THEN PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW HER I WOULD HAVE DONE SO AGAIN TODAY BUT URIAH WAS

STRUGGLING UP THE COACH SIDE THROUGH THE MINGLED DAY AND NIGHT URIAHS HEAD COPPERFIELD SAID HE IN A CROAKING WHISPER AS HE HUNG BY THE IRON ON THE ROOF I THOUGHT YOUD BE GLAD TO HEAR BEFORE YOU WENT

AS IF THE PEAR WERE RIPE ALREADY AND HE WERE SMACKING HIS LIPS OVER IT CHAPTER THE WANDERER WE HAD A VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATION IN BUCKINGHAM STREET THAT NIGHT ABOUT THE DOMESTIC OCCURRENCES I HAVE DETAILED IN THE LAST CHAPTER MY AUNT WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THEM AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM WITH HER ARMS FOLDED FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS WHENEVER SHE WAS PARTICULARLY DISCOMPOSED SHE ALWAYS PERFORMED ONE OF THESE PEDESTRIAN FEATS AND THE AMOUNT OF HER DISCOMPOSURE MIGHT ALWAYS BE ESTIMATED BY THE DURATION OF HER WALK ON THIS OCCASION SHE WAS SO MUCH DISTURBED IN MIND AS TO FIND IT NECESSARY TO OPEN THE BEDROOM DOOR AND MAKE A COURSE FOR HERSELF COMPRISING THE FULL EXTENT OF THE BEDROOMS FROM WALL TO WALL AND WHILE MR DICK AND I SAT QUIETLY BY THE FIRE SHE KEPT PASSING IN AND OUT ALONG THIS MEASURED TRACK AT AN UNCHANGING PACE WITH THE REGULARITY OF A CLOCKPENDULUM WHEN MY AUNT AND I WERE LEFT TO OURSELVES BY MR DICKS GOING OUT TO BED I SAT DOWN TO WRITE MY LETTER TO THE TWO OLD LADIES BY THAT TIME SHE WAS TIRED OF WALKING AND SAT BY THE FIRE WITH HER DRESS TUCKED UP AS USUAL BUT INSTEAD OF SITTING IN HER USUAL MANNER HOLDING HER GLASS UPON HER KNEE SHE SUFFERED IT TO STAND NEGLECTED ON THE CHIMNEYPIECE AND RESTING HER LEFT ELBOW ON HER RIGHT ARM AND HER CHIN ON HER LEFT HAND LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT ME AS OFTEN AS I RAISED MY EYES FROM WHAT I WAS ABOUT I MET HERS I AM IN THE LOVINGEST OF TEMPERS MY DEAR SHE WOULD ASSURE ME WITH A NOD BUT I AM FIDGETED AND SORRY I HAD BEEN TOO BUSY TO OBSERVE UNTIL AFTER SHE WAS GONE TO BED THAT SHE HAD LEFT HER NIGHTMIXTURE AS SHE ALWAYS CALLED IT UNTASTED ON THE CHIMNEYPIECE SHE CAME TO HER DOOR WITH EVEN MORE THAN HER USUAL AFFECTION OF MANNER WHEN I KNOCKED TO ACQUAINT HER WITH THIS DISCOVERY BUT ONLY SAID I HAVE NOT THE HEART TO TAKE IT TROT TONIGHT AND SHOOK HER HEAD AND WENT IN AGAIN SHE READ MY LETTER TO THE TWO OLD LADIES IN THE MORNING AND APPROVED OF IT I POSTED IT AND HAD NOTHING TO DO THEN BUT WAIT AS PATIENTLY AS I COULD FOR THE REPLY I WAS STILL IN THIS STATE OF EXPECTATION AND HAD BEEN FOR NEARLY A WEEK WHEN I LEFT THE DOCTORS ONE SNOWY NIGHT TO WALK HOME IT HAD BEEN A BITTER DAY AND A CUTTING NORTHEAST WIND HAD BLOWN FOR SOME TIME THE WIND HAD GONE DOWN WITH THE LIGHT AND SO THE SNOW HAD COME ON IT WAS A HEAVY SETTLED FALL I RECOLLECT IN GREAT FLAKES AND IT LAY THICK THE NOISE OF WHEELS AND TREAD OF PEOPLE WERE AS HUSHED AS IF THE STREETS HAD BEEN STREWN THAT DEPTH WITH FEATHERS MY SHORTEST WAY HOMEAND I NATURALLY TOOK THE SHORTEST WAY ON SUCH A NIGHTWAS THROUGH ST MARTINS LANE NOW

BURDEN ON THE SMOOTH SNOW TO ADJUST IT MY SEEING THE FACE AND MY SEEING HIM WERE SIMULTANEOUS I DONT THINK I HAD STOPPED IN MY SURPRISE BUT IN ANY CASE AS I WENT ON HE ROSE TURNED AND CAME DOWN

WAS NOT THERE THE SNOW HAD COVERED OUR LATE FOOTPRINTS MY NEW TRACK WAS THE ONLY ONE TO BE SEEN AND EVEN THAT BEGAN TO DIE AWAY IT SNOWED SO FAST AS I LOOKED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER CHAPTER DORAS AUNTS AT LAST AN ANSWER CAME FROM THE TWO OLD LADIES THEY PRESENTED THEIR COMPLIMENTS TO MR COPPERFIELD AND INFORMED HIM THAT THEY HAD GIVEN HIS LETTER THEIR BEST CONSIDERATION WITH A VIEW TO THE HAPPINESS OF BOTH PARTIESWHICH I THOUGHT RATHER AN ALARMING EXPRESSION NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE USE THEY HAD MADE OF IT IN RELATION TO THE FAMILY DIFFERENCE BEFOREMENTIONED BUT BECAUSE I HAD AND HAVE ALL MY LIFE OBSERVED THAT CONVENTIONAL PHRASES ARE A SORT OF FIREWORKS EASILY LET OFF AND LIABLE TO TAKE A GREAT VARIETY OF SHAPES AND COLOURS NOT AT ALL SUGGESTED BY THEIR ORIGINAL FORM THE MISSES SPENLOW ADDED THAT THEY BEGGED TO FORBEAR EXPRESSING THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF CORRESPONDENCE AN OPINION ON THE SUBJECT OF MR COPPERFIELDS COMMUNICATION BUT THAT IF MR COPPERFIELD WOULD DO THEM THE FAVOUR TO CALL UPON A CERTAIN DAY ACCOMPANIED IF HE THOUGHT PROPER BY A CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND THEY WOULD BE HAPPY TO HOLD SOME CONVERSATION ON THE SUBJECT TO THIS FAVOUR MR COPPERFIELD IMMEDIATELY REPLIED WITH HIS RESPECTFUL COMPLIMENTS THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE HONOUR OF WAITING ON THE MISSES SPENLOW AT THE TIME APPOINTED ACCOMPANIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR KIND PERMISSION BY HIS FRIEND MR THOMAS TRADDLES OF THE INNER TEMPLE HAVING DISPATCHED WHICH MISSIVE MR COPPERFIELD FELL INTO A CONDITION OF STRONG NERVOUS AGITATION AND SO REMAINED UNTIL THE DAY ARRIVED IT WAS A GREAT AUGMENTATION OF MY UNEASINESS TO BE BEREAVED AT THIS EVENTFUL CRISIS OF THE INESTIMABLE SERVICES OF MISS MILLS BUT MR MILLS WHO WAS ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING OR OTHER TO ANNOY MEOR I FELT AS IF HE WERE WHICH WAS THE SAME THINGHAD BROUGHT HIS CONDUCT TO A CLIMAX BY TAKING IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT HE WOULD GO TO INDIA WHY SHOULD HE GO TO INDIA EXCEPT TO HARASS ME TO BE SURE HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD AND HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO WITH THAT PART BEING ENTIRELY IN THE INDIA TRADE WHATEVER THAT WAS I HAD FLOATING DREAMS MYSELF CONCERNING GOLDEN SHAWLS AND ELEPHANTS TEETH HAVING BEEN AT CALCUTTA IN HIS YOUTH AND DESIGNING NOW TO GO OUT THERE AGAIN IN THE CAPACITY OF RESIDENT PARTNER BUT THIS WAS NOTHING TO ME HOWEVER IT WAS SO MUCH TO HIM THAT FOR INDIA HE WAS BOUND AND JULIA WITH HIM AND JULIA WENT INTO THE COUNTRY TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER RELATIONS AND THE HOUSE WAS PUT INTO A PERFECT SUIT OF BILLS ANNOUNCING THAT IT WAS TO BE LET OR SOLD AND THAT THE FURNITURE MANGLE AND ALL WAS TO BE TAKEN AT A VALUATION SO HERE WAS ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE OF WHICH I BECAME THE SPORT BEFORE I HAD RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK OF ITS PREDECESSOR I WAS IN SEVERAL MINDS HOW TO DRESS MYSELF ON THE IMPORTANT DAY BEING DIVIDED BETWEEN MY DESIRE TO APPEAR TO ADVANTAGE AND MY APPREHENSIONS OF PUTTING ON ANYTHING THAT MIGHT IMPAIR MY SEVERELY PRACTICAL CHARACTER IN THE EYES OF THE MISSES SPENLOW I ENDEAVOURED TO HIT A HAPPY MEDIUM BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES MY AUNT APPROVED THE RESULT AND MR DICK THREW ONE OF HIS SHOES AFTER TRADDLES AND ME FOR LUCK AS WE WENT DOWNSTAIRS EXCELLENT FELLOW AS I KNEW TRADDLES TO BE AND WARMLY ATTACHED TO HIM AS I WAS I COULD NOT HELP WISHING ON THAT DELICATE OCCASION THAT HE HAD NEVER CONTRACTED THE HABIT OF BRUSHING HIS HAIR SO VERY UPRIGHT IT GAVE HIM A SURPRISED LOOKNOT TO SAY A HEARTHBROOMY KIND OF EXPRESSIONWHICH MY APPREHENSIONS WHISPERED MIGHT BE FATAL TO US I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF MENTIONING IT TO TRADDLES AS WE WERE WALKING TO PUTNEY AND SAYING THAT IF HE WOULD SMOOTH IT DOWN A LITTLE MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID TRADDLES LIFTING OFF HIS HAT AND RUBBING HIS HAIR ALL KINDS OF WAYS NOTHING WOULD GIVE ME GREATER PLEASURE BUT IT WONT WONT BE SMOOTHED DOWN SAID I NO SAID TRADDLES NOTHING WILL INDUCE IT IF I WAS TO CARRY A HALFHUNDREDWEIGHT UPON IT ALL THE WAY TO PUTNEY IT WOULD BE UP AGAIN THE MOMENT THE WEIGHT WAS TAKEN OFF YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT OBSTINATE HAIR MINE IS COPPERFIELD I AM QUITE A FRETFUL PORCUPINE I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED I MUST CONFESS BUT THOROUGHLY CHARMED BY HIS GOODNATURE TOO I TOLD HIM HOW I ESTEEMED HIS GOODNATURE AND SAID THAT HIS HAIR MUST HAVE TAKEN ALL THE OBSTINACY OUT OF HIS CHARACTER FOR HE HAD NONE OH RETURNED TRADDLES LAUGHING I ASSURE YOU ITS QUITE AN OLD STORY MY UNFORTUNATE HAIR MY UNCLES WIFE COULDNT BEAR IT SHE SAID IT EXASPERATED HER IT STOOD VERY MUCH IN MY WAY TOO WHEN I FIRST FELL IN LOVE WITH SOPHY VERY MUCH DID SHE OBJECT TO IT SHE DIDNT REJOINED TRADDLES BUT HER ELDEST SISTERTHE ONE THATS THE BEAUTYQUITE MADE GAME OF IT I UNDERSTAND IN FACT ALL THE SISTERS LAUGH AT IT AGREEABLE SAID I YES RETURNED TRADDLES WITH PERFECT INNOCENCE ITS A JOKE FOR US THEY PRETEND THAT SOPHY HAS A LOCK OF IT IN HER DESK AND IS OBLIGED TO SHUT IT IN A CLASPED BOOK TO KEEP IT DOWN WE LAUGH ABOUT IT BY THE BY MY DEAR TRADDLES SAID I YOUR EXPERIENCE MAY SUGGEST SOMETHING TO ME WHEN YOU BECAME ENGAGED TO THE YOUNG LADY WHOM YOU HAVE JUST MENTIONED DID YOU MAKE A REGULAR PROPOSAL TO HER FAMILY WAS THERE ANYTHING LIKEWHAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH TODAY FOR INSTANCE I ADDED NERVOUSLY WHY REPLIED TRADDLES ON WHOSE ATTENTIVE FACE A THOUGHTFUL SHADE HAD STOLEN IT WAS RATHER A PAINFUL TRANSACTION COPPERFIELD IN MY CASE YOU SEE SOPHY BEING OF SO MUCH USE IN THE FAMILY NONE OF THEM COULD ENDURE THE THOUGHT OF HER EVER BEING MARRIED INDEED THEY HAD QUITE SETTLED AMONG THEMSELVES THAT SHE NEVER WAS TO BE MARRIED AND THEY CALLED HER THE OLD MAID ACCORDINGLY WHEN I MENTIONED IT WITH THE GREATEST PRECAUTION TO MRS CREWLER THE MAMA SAID I THE MAMA SAID TRADDLESREVEREND HORACE CREWLERWHEN I MENTIONED IT WITH EVERY POSSIBLE PRECAUTION TO MRS CREWLER THE EFFECT UPON HER WAS SUCH THAT SHE GAVE A SCREAM AND BECAME INSENSIBLE I COULDNT APPROACH THE SUBJECT AGAIN FOR MONTHS YOU DID AT LAST SAID I WELL THE REVEREND HORACE DID SAID TRADDLES HE IS AN EXCELLENT MAN MOST EXEMPLARY IN EVERY WAY AND HE POINTED OUT TO HER THAT SHE OUGHT AS A CHRISTIAN TO RECONCILE HERSELF TO THE SACRIFICE ESPECIALLY AS IT WAS SO UNCERTAIN AND TO BEAR NO UNCHARITABLE FEELING TOWARDS ME AS TO MYSELF COPPERFIELD I GIVE YOU MY WORD I FELT A PERFECT BIRD OF PREY TOWARDS THE FAMILY THE SISTERS TOOK YOUR PART I HOPE TRADDLES WHY I CANT SAY THEY DID HE RETURNED WHEN WE HAD COMPARATIVELY RECONCILED MRS CREWLER TO IT WE HAD TO BREAK IT TO SARAH YOU RECOLLECT MY MENTIONING SARAH AS THE ONE THAT HAS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH HER SPINE PERFECTLY SHE CLENCHED BOTH HER HANDS SAID TRADDLES LOOKING AT ME IN DISMAY SHUT HER EYES TURNED LEADCOLOUR BECAME PERFECTLY STIFF AND TOOK NOTHING FOR TWO DAYS BUT TOASTANDWATER ADMINISTERED WITH A TEASPOON WHAT A VERY UNPLEASANT GIRL TRADDLES I REMARKED OH I BEG YOUR PARDON COPPERFIELD SAID TRADDLES SHE IS A VERY CHARMING GIRL BUT SHE HAS A GREAT DEAL OF FEELING IN FACT THEY ALL HAVE SOPHY TOLD ME AFTERWARDS THAT THE SELFREPROACH SHE UNDERWENT WHILE SHE WAS IN ATTENDANCE UPON SARAH NO WORDS COULD DESCRIBE I KNOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERE BY MY OWN FEELINGS COPPERFIELD WHICH WERE LIKE A CRIMINALS AFTER SARAH WAS RESTORED WE STILL HAD TO BREAK IT TO THE OTHER EIGHT AND IT PRODUCED VARIOUS EFFECTS UPON THEM OF A MOST PATHETIC NATURE THE TWO LITTLE ONES WHOM SOPHY EDUCATES HAVE ONLY JUST LEFT OFF DETESTING ME AT ANY RATE THEY ARE ALL RECONCILED TO IT NOW I HOPE SAID I YEYES I SHOULD SAY THEY WERE ON THE WHOLE RESIGNED TO IT SAID TRADDLES DOUBTFULLY THE FACT IS WE AVOID MENTIONING THE SUBJECT AND MY UNSETTLED PROSPECTS AND INDIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE A GREAT CONSOLATION TO THEM THERE WILL BE A DEPLORABLE SCENE WHENEVER WE ARE MARRIED IT WILL BE MUCH MORE LIKE A FUNERAL THAN A WEDDING AND THEYLL ALL HATE ME FOR TAKING HER AWAY HIS HONEST FACE AS HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A SERIOCOMIC SHAKE OF HIS HEAD IMPRESSES ME MORE IN THE REMEMBRANCE THAN IT DID IN THE REALITY FOR I WAS BY THIS TIME IN A STATE OF SUCH EXCESSIVE TREPIDATION AND WANDERING OF MIND AS TO BE QUITE UNABLE TO FIX MY ATTENTION ON ANYTHING ON OUR APPROACHING THE HOUSE WHERE THE MISSES SPENLOW LIVED I WAS AT SUCH A DISCOUNT IN RESPECT OF MY PERSONAL LOOKS AND PRESENCE OF MIND THAT TRADDLES PROPOSED A GENTLE STIMULANT IN THE FORM OF A GLASS OF ALE THIS HAVING BEEN ADMINISTERED AT A NEIGHBOURING PUBLICHOUSE HE CONDUCTED ME WITH TOTTERING STEPS TO THE MISSES SPENLOWS DOOR I HAD A VAGUE SENSATION OF BEING AS IT WERE ON VIEW WHEN THE MAID OPENED IT AND OF WAVERING SOMEHOW ACROSS A HALL WITH A WEATHERGLASS IN IT INTO A QUIET LITTLE DRAWINGROOM ON THE GROUNDFLOOR COMMANDING A NEAT GARDEN ALSO OF SITTING DOWN HERE ON A SOFA AND SEEING TRADDLESS HAIR START UP NOW HIS HAT WAS REMOVED LIKE ONE OF THOSE OBTRUSIVE LITTLE FIGURES MADE OF SPRINGS THAT FLY OUT OF FICTITIOUS SNUFFBOXES WHEN THE LID IS TAKEN OFF ALSO OF HEARING AN OLDFASHIONED CLOCK TICKING AWAY ON THE CHIMNEYPIECE AND TRYING TO MAKE IT KEEP TIME TO THE JERKING OF MY HEARTWHICH IT WOULDNT ALSO OF LOOKING ROUND THE ROOM FOR ANY SIGN OF DORA AND SEEING NONE ALSO OF THINKING THAT JIP ONCE BARKED IN THE DISTANCE AND WAS INSTANTLY CHOKED BY SOMEBODY ULTIMATELY I FOUND MYSELF BACKING TRADDLES INTO THE FIREPLACE AND BOWING IN GREAT CONFUSION TO TWO DRY LITTLE ELDERLY LADIES DRESSED IN BLACK AND EACH LOOKING WONDERFULLY LIKE A PREPARATION IN CHIP OR TAN OF THE LATE MR SPENLOW PRAY SAID ONE OF THE TWO LITTLE LADIES BE SEATED WHEN I HAD DONE TUMBLING OVER TRADDLES AND HAD SAT UPON SOMETHING WHICH WAS NOT A CATMY FIRST SEAT WASI SO FAR RECOVERED MY SIGHT AS TO PERCEIVE THAT MR SPENLOW HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN THE YOUNGEST OF THE FAMILY THAT THERE WAS A DISPARITY OF SIX OR EIGHT YEARS BETWEEN THE TWO SISTERS AND THAT THE YOUNGER APPEARED TO BE THE MANAGER OF THE CONFERENCE INASMUCH AS SHE HAD MY LETTER IN HER HANDSO FAMILIAR AS IT LOOKED TO ME AND YET SO ODDAND WAS REFERRING TO IT THROUGH AN EYEGLASS THEY WERE DRESSED ALIKE BUT THIS SISTER WORE HER DRESS WITH A MORE YOUTHFUL AIR THAN THE OTHER AND PERHAPS HAD A TRIFLE MORE FRILL OR TUCKER OR BROOCH OR BRACELET OR SOME LITTLE THING OF THAT KIND WHICH MADE HER LOOK MORE LIVELY THEY WERE BOTH UPRIGHT IN THEIR CARRIAGE FORMAL PRECISE COMPOSED AND QUIET THE SISTER WHO HAD NOT MY LETTER HAD HER ARMS CROSSED ON HER BREAST AND RESTING ON EACH OTHER LIKE AN IDOL MR COPPERFIELD I BELIEVE SAID THE SISTER WHO HAD GOT MY LETTER ADDRESSING HERSELF TO TRADDLES THIS WAS A FRIGHTFUL BEGINNING TRADDLES HAD TO INDICATE THAT I WAS MR COPPERFIELD AND I HAD TO LAY CLAIM TO MYSELF AND THEY HAD TO DIVEST THEMSELVES OF A PRECONCEIVED OPINION THAT TRADDLES WAS MR COPPERFIELD AND ALTOGETHER WE WERE IN A NICE CONDITION TO IMPROVE IT WE ALL DISTINCTLY HEARD JIP GIVE TWO SHORT BARKS AND RECEIVE ANOTHER CHOKE MR COPPERFIELD SAID THE SISTER WITH THE LETTER I DID SOMETHINGBOWED I SUPPOSEAND WAS ALL ATTENTION WHEN THE OTHER SISTER STRUCK IN MY SISTER LAVINIA SAID SHE BEING CONVERSANT WITH MATTERS OF THIS NATURE WILL STATE WHAT WE CONSIDER MOST CALCULATED TO PROMOTE THE HAPPINESS OF BOTH PARTIES I DISCOVERED AFTERWARDS THAT MISS LAVINIA WAS AN AUTHORITY IN AFFAIRS OF THE HEART BY REASON OF THERE HAVING ANCIENTLY EXISTED A CERTAIN MR PIDGER WHO PLAYED SHORT WHIST AND WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN ENAMOURED OF HER MY PRIVATE OPINION IS THAT THIS WAS ENTIRELY A GRATUITOUS ASSUMPTION AND THAT PIDGER WAS ALTOGETHER INNOCENT OF ANY SUCH SENTIMENTSTO WHICH HE HAD NEVER GIVEN ANY SORT OF EXPRESSION THAT I COULD EVER HEAR OF BOTH MISS LAVINIA AND MISS CLARISSA HAD A SUPERSTITION HOWEVER THAT HE WOULD HAVE DECLARED HIS PASSION IF HE HAD NOT BEEN CUT SHORT IN HIS YOUTH AT ABOUT SIXTY BY OVERDRINKING HIS CONSTITUTION AND OVERDOING AN ATTEMPT TO SET IT RIGHT AGAIN BY SWILLING BATH WATER THEY HAD A LURKING SUSPICION EVEN THAT HE DIED OF SECRET LOVE THOUGH I MUST SAY THERE WAS A PICTURE OF HIM IN THE HOUSE WITH A DAMASK NOSE WHICH CONCEALMENT DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE EVER PREYED UPON WE WILL NOT SAID MISS LAVINIA ENTER ON THE PAST HISTORY OF THIS MATTER OUR POOR BROTHER FRANCISS DEATH HAS CANCELLED THAT WE HAD NOT SAID MISS CLARISSA BEEN IN THE HABIT OF FREQUENT ASSOCIATION WITH OUR BROTHER FRANCIS BUT THERE WAS NO DECIDED DIVISION OR DISUNION BETWEEN US FRANCIS TOOK HIS ROAD WE TOOK OURS WE CONSIDERED IT CONDUCIVE TO THE HAPPINESS OF ALL PARTIES THAT IT SHOULD BE SO AND IT WAS SO EACH OF THE SISTERS LEANED A LITTLE FORWARD TO SPEAK SHOOK HER HEAD AFTER SPEAKING AND BECAME UPRIGHT AGAIN WHEN SILENT MISS CLARISSA NEVER MOVED HER ARMS SHE SOMETIMES PLAYED TUNES UPON THEM WITH HER FINGERSMINUETS AND MARCHES I SHOULD THINKBUT NEVER MOVED THEM OUR NIECES POSITION OR SUPPOSED POSITION IS MUCH CHANGED BY OUR BROTHER FRANCISS DEATH SAID MISS LAVINIA AND THEREFORE WE CONSIDER OUR BROTHERS OPINIONS AS REGARDED HER POSITION AS BEING CHANGED TOO WE HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT MR COPPERFIELD THAT YOU ARE A YOUNG GENTLEMAN POSSESSED OF GOOD QUALITIES AND HONOURABLE CHARACTER OR THAT YOU HAVE AN AFFECTIONOR ARE FULLY PERSUADED THAT YOU HAVE AN AFFECTIONFOR OUR NIECE I REPLIED AS I USUALLY DID WHENEVER I HAD A CHANCE THAT NOBODY HAD EVER LOVED ANYBODY ELSE AS I LOVED DORA TRADDLES CAME TO MY ASSISTANCE WITH A CONFIRMATORY MURMUR MISS LAVINIA WAS GOING ON TO MAKE SOME REJOINDER WHEN MISS CLARISSA WHO APPEARED TO BE INCESSANTLY BESET BY A DESIRE TO REFER TO HER BROTHER FRANCIS STRUCK IN AGAIN IF DORAS MAMA SHE SAID WHEN SHE MARRIED OUR BROTHER FRANCIS HAD AT ONCE SAID THAT THERE WAS NOT ROOM FOR THE FAMILY AT THE DINNERTABLE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THE HAPPINESS OF ALL PARTIES SISTER CLARISSA SAID MISS LAVINIA PERHAPS WE NEEDNT MIND THAT NOW SISTER LAVINIA SAID MISS CLARISSA IT BELONGS TO THE SUBJECT WITH YOUR BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT ON WHICH ALONE YOU ARE COMPETENT TO SPEAK I SHOULD NOT THINK OF INTERFERING ON THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT I HAVE A VOICE AND AN OPINION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR THE HAPPINESS OF ALL PARTIES IF DORAS MAMA WHEN SHE MARRIED OUR BROTHER FRANCIS HAD MENTIONED PLAINLY WHAT HER INTENTIONS WERE WE SHOULD THEN HAVE KNOWN WHAT WE HAD TO EXPECT WE SHOULD HAVE SAID PRAY DO NOT INVITE US AT ANY TIME AND ALL POSSIBILITY OF MISUNDERSTANDING WOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED WHEN MISS CLARISSA HAD SHAKEN HER HEAD MISS LAVINIA RESUMED AGAIN REFERRING TO MY LETTER THROUGH HER EYEGLASS THEY BOTH HAD LITTLE BRIGHT ROUND TWINKLING EYES BY THE WAY WHICH WERE LIKE BIRDS EYES THEY WERE NOT UNLIKE BIRDS ALTOGETHER HAVING A SHARP BRISK SUDDEN MANNER AND A LITTLE SHORT SPRUCE WAY OF ADJUSTING THEMSELVES LIKE CANARIES MISS LAVINIA AS I HAVE SAID RESUMED YOU ASK PERMISSION OF MY SISTER CLARISSA AND MYSELF MR COPPERFIELD TO VISIT HERE AS THE ACCEPTED SUITOR OF OUR NIECE IF OUR BROTHER FRANCIS SAID MISS CLARISSA BREAKING OUT AGAIN IF I MAY CALL ANYTHING SO CALM A BREAKING OUT WISHED TO SURROUND HIMSELF WITH AN ATMOSPHERE OF DOCTORS COMMONS AND OF DOCTORS COMMONS ONLY WHAT RIGHT OR DESIRE HAD WE TO OBJECT NONE I AM SURE WE HAVE EVER BEEN FAR FROM WISHING TO OBTRUDE OURSELVES ON ANYONE BUT WHY NOT SAY SO LET OUR BROTHER FRANCIS AND HIS WIFE HAVE THEIR SOCIETY LET MY SISTER LAVINIA AND MYSELF HAVE OUR SOCIETY WE CAN FIND IT FOR OURSELVES I HOPE AS THIS APPEARED TO BE ADDRESSED TO TRADDLES AND ME BOTH TRADDLES AND I MADE SOME SORT OF REPLY TRADDLES WAS INAUDIBLE I THINK I OBSERVED MYSELF THAT IT WAS HIGHLY CREDITABLE TO ALL CONCERNED I DONT IN THE LEAST KNOW WHAT I MEANT SISTER LAVINIA SAID MISS CLARISSA HAVING NOW RELIEVED HER MIND YOU CAN GO ON MY DEAR MISS LAVINIA PROCEEDED MR COPPERFIELD MY SISTER CLARISSA AND I HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL INDEED IN CONSIDERING THIS LETTER AND WE HAVE NOT CONSIDERED IT WITHOUT FINALLY SHOWING IT TO OUR NIECE AND DISCUSSING IT WITH OUR NIECE WE HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU THINK YOU LIKE HER VERY MUCH THINK MAAM I RAPTUROUSLY BEGAN OH BUT MISS CLARISSA GIVING ME A LOOK JUST LIKE A SHARP CANARY AS REQUESTING THAT I WOULD NOT INTERRUPT THE ORACLE I BEGGED PARDON AFFECTION SAID MISS LAVINIA GLANCING AT HER SISTER FOR CORROBORATION WHICH SHE GAVE IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE NOD TO EVERY CLAUSE MATURE AFFECTION HOMAGE DEVOTION DOES NOT EASILY EXPRESS ITSELF ITS VOICE IS LOW IT IS MODEST AND RETIRING IT LIES IN AMBUSH WAITS AND WAITS SUCH IS THE MATURE FRUIT SOMETIMES A LIFE GLIDES AWAY AND FINDS IT STILL RIPENING IN THE SHADE OF COURSE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEN THAT THIS WAS AN ALLUSION TO HER SUPPOSED EXPERIENCE OF THE STRICKEN PIDGER BUT I SAW FROM THE GRAVITY WITH WHICH MISS CLARISSA NODDED HER HEAD THAT GREAT WEIGHT WAS ATTACHED TO THESE WORDS THE LIGHTFOR I CALL THEM IN COMPARISON WITH SUCH SENTIMENTS THE LIGHTINCLINATIONS OF VERY YOUNG PEOPLE PURSUED MISS LAVINIA ARE DUST COMPARED TO ROCKS IT IS OWING TO THE DIFFICULTY OF KNOWING WHETHER THEY ARE LIKELY TO ENDURE OR HAVE ANY REAL FOUNDATION THAT MY SISTER CLARISSA AND MYSELF HAVE BEEN VERY UNDECIDED HOW TO ACT MR COPPERFIELD AND MR TRADDLES SAID MY FRIEND FINDING HIMSELF LOOKED AT I BEG PARDON OF THE INNER TEMPLE I BELIEVE SAID MISS CLARISSA AGAIN GLANCING AT MY LETTER TRADDLES SAID EXACTLY SO AND BECAME PRETTY RED IN THE FACE NOW ALTHOUGH I HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY EXPRESS ENCOURAGEMENT AS YET I FANCIED THAT I SAW IN THE TWO LITTLE SISTERS AND PARTICULARLY IN MISS LAVINIA AN INTENSIFIED ENJOYMENT OF THIS NEW AND FRUITFUL SUBJECT OF DOMESTIC INTEREST A SETTLING DOWN TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT A DISPOSITION TO PET IT IN WHICH THERE WAS A GOOD BRIGHT RAY OF HOPE I THOUGHT I PERCEIVED THAT MISS LAVINIA WOULD HAVE UNCOMMON SATISFACTION IN SUPERINTENDING TWO YOUNG LOVERS LIKE DORA AND ME AND THAT MISS CLARISSA WOULD HAVE HARDLY LESS SATISFACTION IN SEEING HER SUPERINTEND US AND IN CHIMING IN WITH HER OWN PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT OF THE SUBJECT WHENEVER THAT IMPULSE WAS STRONG UPON HER THIS GAVE ME COURAGE TO PROTEST MOST VEHEMENTLY THAT I LOVED DORA BETTER THAN I COULD TELL OR ANYONE BELIEVE THAT ALL MY FRIENDS KNEW HOW I LOVED HER THAT MY AUNT AGNES TRADDLES EVERYONE WHO KNEW ME KNEW HOW I LOVED HER AND HOW EARNEST MY LOVE HAD MADE ME FOR THE TRUTH OF THIS I APPEALED TO TRADDLES AND TRADDLES FIRING UP AS IF HE WERE PLUNGING INTO A PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE REALLY DID COME OUT NOBLY CONFIRMING ME IN GOOD ROUND TERMS AND IN A PLAIN SENSIBLE PRACTICAL MANNER THAT EVIDENTLY MADE A FAVOURABLE IMPRESSION I SPEAK IF I MAY PRESUME TO SAY SO AS ONE WHO HAS SOME LITTLE EXPERIENCE OF SUCH THINGS SAID TRADDLES BEING MYSELF ENGAGED TO A YOUNG LADYONE OF TEN DOWN IN DEVONSHIREAND SEEING NO PROBABILITY AT PRESENT OF OUR ENGAGEMENT COMING TO A TERMINATION YOU MAY BE ABLE TO CONFIRM WHAT I HAVE SAID MR TRADDLES OBSERVED MISS LAVINIA EVIDENTLY TAKING A NEW INTEREST IN HIM OF THE AFFECTION THAT IS MODEST AND RETIRING THAT WAITS AND WAITS ENTIRELY MAAM SAID TRADDLES MISS CLARISSA LOOKED AT MISS LAVINIA AND SHOOK HER HEAD GRAVELY MISS LAVINIA LOOKED CONSCIOUSLY AT MISS CLARISSA AND HEAVED A LITTLE SIGH SISTER LAVINIA SAID MISS CLARISSA TAKE MY SMELLINGBOTTLE MISS LAVINIA REVIVED HERSELF WITH A FEW WHIFFS OF AROMATIC VINEGARTRADDLES AND I LOOKING ON WITH GREAT SOLICITUDE THE WHILE AND THEN WENT ON TO SAY RATHER FAINTLY MY SISTER AND MYSELF HAVE BEEN IN GREAT DOUBT MR TRADDLES WHAT COURSE WE OUGHT TO TAKE IN REFERENCE TO THE LIKINGS OR IMAGINARY LIKINGS OF SUCH VERY YOUNG PEOPLE AS YOUR FRIEND MR COPPERFIELD AND OUR NIECE OUR BROTHER FRANCISS CHILD REMARKED MISS CLARISSA IF OUR BROTHER FRANCISS WIFE HAD FOUND IT CONVENIENT IN HER LIFETIME THOUGH SHE HAD AN UNQUESTIONABLE RIGHT TO ACT AS SHE THOUGHT BEST TO INVITE THE FAMILY TO HER DINNERTABLE WE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN OUR BROTHER FRANCISS CHILD BETTER AT THE PRESENT MOMENT SISTER LAVINIA PROCEED MISS LAVINIA TURNED MY LETTER SO AS TO BRING THE SUPERSCRIPTION TOWARDS HERSELF AND REFERRED THROUGH HER EYEGLASS TO SOME ORDERLYLOOKING NOTES SHE HAD MADE ON THAT PART OF IT IT SEEMS TO US SAID SHE PRUDENT MR TRADDLES TO BRING THESE FEELINGS TO THE TEST OF OUR OWN OBSERVATION AT PRESENT WE KNOW NOTHING OF THEM AND ARE NOT IN A SITUATION TO JUDGE HOW MUCH REALITY THERE MAY BE IN THEM THEREFORE WE ARE INCLINED SO FAR TO ACCEDE TO MR COPPERFIELDS PROPOSAL AS TO ADMIT HIS VISITS HERE I SHALL NEVER DEAR LADIES I EXCLAIMED RELIEVED OF AN IMMENSE LOAD OF APPREHENSION FORGET YOUR KINDNESS BUT PURSUED MISS LAVINIABUT WE WOULD PREFER TO REGARD THOSE VISITS MR TRADDLES AS MADE AT PRESENT TO US WE MUST GUARD OURSELVES FROM RECOGNIZING ANY POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN MR COPPERFIELD AND OUR NIECE UNTIL WE HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY UNTIL YOU HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY SISTER LAVINIA SAID MISS CLARISSA BE IT SO ASSENTED MISS LAVINIA WITH A SIGHUNTIL I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING THEM COPPERFIELD SAID TRADDLES TURNING TO ME YOU FEEL I AM SURE THAT NOTHING COULD BE MORE REASONABLE OR CONSIDERATE NOTHING CRIED I I AM DEEPLY SENSIBLE OF IT IN THIS POSITION OF AFFAIRS SAID MISS LAVINIA AGAIN REFERRING TO HER NOTES AND ADMITTING HIS VISITS ON THIS UNDERSTANDING ONLY WE MUST REQUIRE FROM MR COPPERFIELD A DISTINCT ASSURANCE ON HIS WORD OF HONOUR THAT NO COMMUNICATION OF ANY KIND SHALL TAKE PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND OUR NIECE WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT NO PROJECT WHATEVER SHALL BE ENTERTAINED WITH REGARD TO OUR NIECE WITHOUT BEING FIRST SUBMITTED TO US TO YOU SISTER LAVINIA MISS CLARISSA INTERPOSED BE IT SO CLARISSA ASSENTED MISS LAVINIA RESIGNEDLYTO MEAND RECEIVING OUR CONCURRENCE WE MUST MAKE THIS A MOST EXPRESS AND SERIOUS STIPULATION NOT TO BE BROKEN ON ANY ACCOUNT WE WISHED MR COPPERFIELD TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY SOME CONFIDENTIAL FRIEND TODAY WITH AN INCLINATION OF HER HEAD TOWARDS TRADDLES WHO BOWED IN ORDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION ON THIS SUBJECT IF MR COPPERFIELD OR IF YOU MR TRADDLES FEEL THE LEAST SCRUPLE IN GIVING THIS PROMISE I BEG YOU TO TAKE TIME TO CONSIDER IT I EXCLAIMED IN A STATE OF HIGH ECSTATIC FERVOUR THAT NOT A MOMENTS CONSIDERATION COULD BE NECESSARY I BOUND MYSELF BY THE REQUIRED PROMISE IN A MOST IMPASSIONED MANNER CALLED UPON TRADDLES TO WITNESS IT AND DENOUNCED MYSELF AS THE MOST ATROCIOUS OF CHARACTERS IF I EVER SWERVED FROM IT IN THE LEAST DEGREE STAY SAID MISS LAVINIA HOLDING UP HER HAND WE RESOLVED BEFORE WE HAD THE PLEASURE OF RECEIVING YOU TWO GENTLEMEN TO LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO CONSIDER THIS POINT YOU WILL ALLOW US TO RETIRE IT WAS IN VAIN FOR ME TO SAY THAT NO CONSIDERATION WAS NECESSARY THEY PERSISTED IN WITHDRAWING FOR THE SPECIFIED TIME ACCORDINGLY THESE LITTLE BIRDS HOPPED OUT WITH GREAT DIGNITY LEAVING ME TO RECEIVE THE CONGRATULATIONS OF TRADDLES AND TO FEEL AS IF I WERE TRANSLATED TO REGIONS OF EXQUISITE HAPPINESS EXACTLY AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE QUARTER OF AN HOUR THEY REAPPEARED WITH NO LESS DIGNITY THAN THEY HAD DISAPPEARED THEY HAD GONE RUSTLING AWAY AS IF THEIR LITTLE DRESSES WERE MADE OF AUTUMNLEAVES AND THEY CAME RUSTLING BACK IN LIKE MANNER I THEN BOUND MYSELF ONCE MORE TO THE PRESCRIBED CONDITIONS

IS BETTER FOR THE HAPPINESS OF ALL PARTIES WE ARE GLAD TO RECEIVE VISITS AND RETURN THEM WHEN IT IS BETTER FOR THE HAPPINESS OF ALL PARTIES THAT NO VISITING SHOULD TAKE PLACE AS IN THE CASE OF OUR BROTHER FRANCIS AND HIS ESTABLISHMENT THAT IS QUITE DIFFERENT I INTIMATED THAT MY AUNT WOULD BE PROUD AND DELIGHTED TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE THOUGH I MUST SAY I WAS NOT QUITE SURE OF THEIR GETTING ON VERY SATISFACTORILY TOGETHER THE CONDITIONS BEING NOW CLOSED I EXPRESSED MY ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS IN THE WARMEST MANNER AND TAKING THE HAND FIRST OF MISS CLARISSA AND THEN OF MISS LAVINIA PRESSED IT IN EACH CASE TO MY LIPS MISS LAVINIA THEN AROSE AND BEGGING MR TRADDLES TO EXCUSE US FOR A MINUTE REQUESTED ME TO FOLLOW HER I OBEYED ALL IN A TREMBLE AND WAS CONDUCTED INTO ANOTHER ROOM THERE I FOUND MY BLESSED DARLING STOPPING HER EARS BEHIND THE DOOR WITH HER DEAR LITTLE FACE AGAINST THE WALL AND JIP IN THE PLATEWARMER WITH HIS HEAD TIED UP IN A TOWEL OH HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS IN HER BLACK FROCK AND HOW SHE SOBBED AND CRIED AT FIRST AND WOULDNT COME OUT FROM BEHIND THE DOOR HOW FOND WE WERE OF ONE ANOTHER WHEN SHE DID COME OUT AT LAST AND WHAT A STATE OF BLISS I WAS IN WHEN WE TOOK JIP OUT OF THE PLATEWARMER AND RESTORED HIM TO THE LIGHT SNEEZING VERY MUCH AND WERE ALL THREE REUNITED MY DEAREST DORA NOW INDEED MY OWN FOR EVER OH DONT PLEADED DORA PLEASE ARE YOU NOT MY OWN FOR EVER DORA OH YES OF COURSE I AM CRIED DORA BUT I AM SO FRIGHTENED FRIGHTENED MY OWN OH YES I DONT LIKE HIM SAID DORA WHY DONT HE GO WHO MY LIFE YOUR FRIEND SAID DORA IT ISNT ANY BUSINESS OF HIS WHAT A STUPID HE MUST BE MY LOVE THERE NEVER WAS ANYTHING SO COAXING AS HER CHILDISH WAYS HE IS THE BEST CREATURE OH BUT WE DONT WANT ANY BEST CREATURES POUTED DORA MY DEAR I ARGUED YOU WILL SOON KNOW HIM WELL AND LIKE HIM OF ALL THINGS AND HERE IS MY AUNT COMING SOON AND YOULL LIKE HER OF ALL THINGS TOO WHEN YOU KNOW HER NO PLEASE DONT BRING HER SAID DORA GIVING ME A HORRIFIED LITTLE KISS AND FOLDING HER HANDS DONT I KNOW SHES A NAUGHTY MISCHIEFMAKING OLD THING DONT LET HER COME HERE DOADY WHICH WAS A CORRUPTION OF DAVID REMONSTRANCE WAS OF NO USE THEN SO I LAUGHED AND ADMIRED AND WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE AND VERY HAPPY AND SHE SHOWED ME JIPS NEW TRICK OF STANDING ON HIS HIND LEGS IN A CORNERWHICH HE DID FOR ABOUT THE SPACE OF A FLASH OF LIGHTNING AND THEN FELL DOWNAND I DONT KNOW HOW LONG I SHOULD HAVE STAYED THERE OBLIVIOUS OF TRADDLES IF MISS LAVINIA HAD NOT COME IN TO TAKE ME AWAY MISS LAVINIA WAS VERY FOND OF DORA SHE TOLD ME DORA WAS EXACTLY LIKE WHAT SHE HAD BEEN HERSELF AT HER AGESHE MUST HAVE ALTERED A GOOD DEAL AND SHE TREATED DORA JUST AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A TOY I WANTED TO PERSUADE DORA TO COME AND SEE TRADDLES BUT ON MY PROPOSING IT SHE RAN OFF TO HER OWN ROOM AND LOCKED HERSELF IN SO I WENT TO TRADDLES WITHOUT HER AND WALKED AWAY WITH HIM ON AIR NOTHING COULD BE MORE SATISFACTORY SAID TRADDLES AND THEY ARE VERY AGREEABLE OLD LADIES I AM SURE I SHOULDNT BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF YOU WERE TO BE MARRIED YEARS BEFORE ME COPPERFIELD DOES YOUR SOPHY PLAY ON ANY INSTRUMENT TRADDLES I INQUIRED IN THE PRIDE OF MY HEART SHE KNOWS ENOUGH OF THE PIANO TO TEACH IT TO HER LITTLE SISTERS SAID TRADDLES DOES SHE SING AT ALL I ASKED WHY SHE SINGS BALLADS SOMETIMES TO FRESHEN UP THE OTHERS A LITTLE WHEN THEYRE OUT OF SPIRITS SAID TRADDLES NOTHING SCIENTIFIC SHE DOESNT SING TO THE GUITAR SAID I OH DEAR NO SAID TRADDLES PAINT AT ALL NOT AT ALL SAID TRADDLES I PROMISED TRADDLES THAT HE SHOULD HEAR DORA SING AND SEE SOME OF HER FLOWERPAINTING HE SAID HE SHOULD LIKE IT VERY MUCH AND WE WENT HOME ARM IN ARM IN GREAT GOOD HUMOUR AND DELIGHT I ENCOURAGED HIM TO TALK ABOUT SOPHY ON THE WAY WHICH HE DID WITH A LOVING RELIANCE ON HER THAT I VERY MUCH ADMIRED I COMPARED HER IN MY MIND WITH DORA WITH CONSIDERABLE INWARD SATISFACTION BUT I CANDIDLY ADMITTED TO MYSELF THAT SHE SEEMED TO BE AN EXCELLENT KIND OF GIRL FOR TRADDLES TOO OF COURSE MY AUNT WAS IMMEDIATELY MADE ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUCCESSFUL ISSUE OF THE CONFERENCE AND WITH ALL THAT HAD BEEN SAID AND DONE IN THE COURSE OF IT SHE WAS HAPPY TO SEE ME SO HAPPY AND PROMISED TO CALL ON DORAS AUNTS WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME BUT SHE TOOK SUCH A LONG WALK UP AND DOWN OUR ROOMS THAT NIGHT WHILE I WAS WRITING TO AGNES THAT I BEGAN TO THINK SHE MEANT TO WALK TILL MORNING MY LETTER TO AGNES WAS A FERVENT AND GRATEFUL ONE NARRATING ALL THE GOOD EFFECTS THAT HAD RESULTED FROM MY FOLLOWING HER ADVICE SHE WROTE BY RETURN OF POST TO ME HER LETTER WAS HOPEFUL EARNEST AND CHEERFUL SHE WAS ALWAYS CHEERFUL FROM THAT TIME I HAD MY HANDS MORE FULL THAN EVER NOW MY DAILY JOURNEYS TO HIGHGATE CONSIDERED PUTNEY WAS A LONG WAY OFF AND I NATURALLY WANTED TO GO THERE AS OFTEN AS I COULD THE PROPOSED TEADRINKINGS BEING QUITE IMPRACTICABLE I COMPOUNDED WITH MISS LAVINIA FOR PERMISSION TO VISIT EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON WITHOUT DETRIMENT TO MY PRIVILEGED SUNDAYS SO THE CLOSE OF EVERY WEEK WAS A DELICIOUS TIME FOR ME AND I GOT THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK BY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT I WAS WONDERFULLY RELIEVED TO FIND THAT MY AUNT AND DORAS AUNTS RUBBED ON ALL THINGS CONSIDERED MUCH MORE SMOOTHLY THAN I COULD HAVE EXPECTED MY AUNT MADE HER PROMISED VISIT WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF THE CONFERENCE AND WITHIN A FEW MORE DAYS DORAS AUNTS CALLED UPON HER IN DUE STATE AND FORM SIMILAR BUT MORE FRIENDLY EXCHANGES TOOK PLACE AFTERWARDS USUALLY AT INTERVALS OF THREE OR FOUR WEEKS I KNOW THAT MY AUNT DISTRESSED DORAS AUNTS VERY MUCH BY UTTERLY SETTING AT NAUGHT THE DIGNITY OF FLYCONVEYANCE AND WALKING OUT TO PUTNEY AT EXTRAORDINARY TIMES AS SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST OR JUST BEFORE TEA LIKEWISE BY WEARING HER BONNET IN ANY MANNER THAT HAPPENED TO BE COMFORTABLE TO HER HEAD WITHOUT AT ALL DEFERRING TO THE PREJUDICES OF CIVILIZATION ON THAT SUBJECT BUT DORAS AUNTS SOON AGREED TO REGARD MY AUNT AS AN ECCENTRIC AND SOMEWHAT MASCULINE LADY WITH A STRONG UNDERSTANDING AND ALTHOUGH MY AUNT OCCASIONALLY RUFFLED THE FEATHERS OF DORAS AUNTS BY EXPRESSING HERETICAL OPINIONS ON VARIOUS POINTS OF CEREMONY SHE LOVED ME TOO WELL NOT TO SACRIFICE SOME OF HER LITTLE PECULIARITIES TO THE GENERAL HARMONY THE ONLY MEMBER OF OUR SMALL SOCIETY WHO POSITIVELY REFUSED TO ADAPT HIMSELF TO CIRCUMSTANCES WAS JIP HE NEVER SAW MY AUNT WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY DISPLAYING EVERY TOOTH IN HIS HEAD RETIRING UNDER A CHAIR AND GROWLING INCESSANTLY WITH NOW AND THEN A DOLEFUL HOWL AS IF SHE REALLY WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS FEELINGS ALL KINDS OF TREATMENT WERE TRIED WITH HIM COAXING SCOLDING SLAPPING BRINGING HIM TO BUCKINGHAM STREET WHERE HE INSTANTLY DASHED AT THE TWO CATS TO THE TERROR OF ALL BEHOLDERS BUT HE NEVER COULD PREVAIL UPON HIMSELF TO BEAR MY AUNTS SOCIETY HE WOULD SOMETIMES THINK HE HAD GOT THE BETTER OF HIS OBJECTION AND BE AMIABLE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN WOULD PUT UP HIS SNUB NOSE AND HOWL TO THAT EXTENT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO BLIND HIM AND PUT HIM IN THE PLATEWARMER AT LENGTH DORA REGULARLY MUFFLED HIM IN A TOWEL AND SHUT HIM UP THERE WHENEVER MY AUNT WAS REPORTED AT THE DOOR ONE THING TROUBLED ME MUCH AFTER WE HAD FALLEN INTO THIS QUIET TRAIN IT WAS THAT DORA SEEMED BY ONE CONSENT TO BE REGARDED LIKE A PRETTY TOY OR PLAYTHING MY AUNT WITH WHOM SHE GRADUALLY BECAME FAMILIAR ALWAYS CALLED HER LITTLE BLOSSOM AND THE PLEASURE OF MISS LAVINIAS LIFE WAS TO WAIT UPON HER CURL HER HAIR MAKE ORNAMENTS FOR HER AND TREAT HER LIKE A PET CHILD WHAT MISS LAVINIA DID HER SISTER DID AS A MATTER OF COURSE IT WAS VERY ODD TO ME BUT THEY ALL SEEMED TO TREAT DORA IN HER DEGREE MUCH AS DORA TREATED JIP IN HIS I MADE UP MY MIND TO SPEAK TO DORA ABOUT THIS AND ONE DAY WHEN WE WERE OUT WALKING FOR WE WERE LICENSED BY MISS LAVINIA AFTER A WHILE TO GO OUT WALKING BY OURSELVES I SAID TO HER THAT I WISHED SHE COULD GET THEM TO BEHAVE TOWARDS HER DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY DARLING I REMONSTRATED YOU ARE NOT A CHILD THERE SAID DORA NOW YOURE GOING TO BE CROSS CROSS MY LOVE I AM SURE THEYRE VERY KIND TO ME SAID DORA AND I AM VERY HAPPY WELL BUT MY DEAREST LIFE SAID I YOU MIGHT BE VERY HAPPY AND YET BE TREATED RATIONALLY DORA GAVE ME A REPROACHFUL LOOKTHE PRETTIEST LOOKAND THEN BEGAN TO SOB SAYING IF I DIDNT LIKE HER WHY HAD I EVER WANTED SO MUCH TO BE ENGAGED TO HER AND WHY DIDNT I GO AWAY NOW IF I COULDNT BEAR HER WHAT COULD I DO BUT KISS AWAY HER TEARS AND TELL HER HOW I DOTED ON HER AFTER THAT I AM SURE I AM VERY AFFECTIONATE SAID DORA YOU OUGHTNT TO BE CRUEL TO ME DOADY CRUEL MY PRECIOUS LOVE AS IF I WOULDOR COULDBE CRUEL TO YOU FOR THE WORLD THEN DONT FIND FAULT WITH ME SAID DORA MAKING A ROSEBUD OF HER MOUTH AND ILL BE GOOD I WAS CHARMED BY HER PRESENTLY ASKING ME OF HER OWN ACCORD TO GIVE HER THAT COOKERYBOOK I HAD ONCE SPOKEN OF AND TO SHOW HER HOW TO KEEP ACCOUNTS AS I HAD ONCE PROMISED I WOULD I BROUGHT THE VOLUME WITH ME ON MY NEXT VISIT I GOT IT PRETTILY BOUND FIRST TO MAKE IT LOOK LESS DRY AND MORE INVITING AND AS WE STROLLED ABOUT THE COMMON I SHOWED HER AN OLD HOUSEKEEPINGBOOK OF MY AUNTS AND GAVE HER A SET OF TABLETS AND A PRETTY LITTLE PENCILCASE AND BOX OF LEADS TO PRACTISE HOUSEKEEPING WITH BUT THE COOKERYBOOK MADE DORAS HEAD ACHE AND THE FIGURES MADE HER CRY THEY WOULDNT ADD UP SHE SAID SO SHE RUBBED THEM OUT AND DREW LITTLE NOSEGAYS AND LIKENESSES OF ME AND JIP ALL OVER THE TABLETS THEN I PLAYFULLY TRIED VERBAL INSTRUCTION IN DOMESTIC MATTERS AS WE WALKED ABOUT ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON SOMETIMES FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE PASSED A BUTCHERS SHOP I WOULD SAY NOW SUPPOSE MY PET THAT WE WERE MARRIED AND YOU WERE GOING TO BUY A SHOULDER OF MUTTON FOR DINNER WOULD YOU KNOW HOW TO BUY IT MY PRETTY LITTLE DORAS FACE WOULD FALL AND SHE WOULD MAKE HER MOUTH INTO A BUD AGAIN AS IF SHE WOULD VERY MUCH PREFER TO SHUT MINE WITH A KISS WOULD YOU KNOW HOW TO BUY IT MY DARLING I WOULD REPEAT PERHAPS IF I WERE VERY INFLEXIBLE DORA WOULD THINK A LITTLE AND THEN REPLY PERHAPS WITH GREAT TRIUMPH WHY THE BUTCHER WOULD KNOW HOW TO SELL IT AND WHAT NEED I KNOW OH YOU SILLY BOY SO WHEN I ONCE ASKED DORA WITH AN EYE TO THE COOKERYBOOK WHAT SHE WOULD DO IF WE WERE MARRIED AND I WERE TO SAY I SHOULD LIKE A NICE IRISH STEW SHE REPLIED THAT SHE WOULD TELL THE SERVANT TO MAKE IT AND THEN CLAPPED HER LITTLE HANDS TOGETHER ACROSS MY ARM AND LAUGHED IN SUCH A CHARMING MANNER THAT SHE WAS MORE DELIGHTFUL THAN EVER CONSEQUENTLY THE PRINCIPAL USE TO WHICH THE COOKERYBOOK WAS DEVOTED WAS BEING PUT DOWN IN THE CORNER FOR JIP TO STAND UPON BUT DORA WAS SO PLEASED WHEN SHE HAD TRAINED HIM TO STAND UPON IT WITHOUT OFFERING TO COME OFF AND AT THE SAME TIME TO HOLD THE PENCILCASE IN HIS MOUTH THAT I WAS VERY GLAD I HAD BOUGHT IT AND WE FELL BACK ON THE GUITARCASE AND THE FLOWERPAINTING AND THE SONGS ABOUT NEVER LEAVING OFF DANCING TA RA LA AND WERE AS HAPPY AS THE WEEK WAS LONG I OCCASIONALLY WISHED I COULD VENTURE TO HINT TO MISS LAVINIA THAT SHE TREATED THE DARLING OF MY HEART A LITTLE TOO MUCH LIKE A PLAYTHING AND I SOMETIMES AWOKE AS IT WERE WONDERING TO FIND THAT I HAD FALLEN INTO THE GENERAL FAULT AND TREATED HER LIKE A PLAYTHING TOOBUT NOT OFTEN CHAPTER MISCHIEF I FEEL AS IF IT WERE NOT FOR ME TO RECORD EVEN THOUGH THIS MANUSCRIPT IS INTENDED FOR NO EYES BUT MINE HOW HARD I WORKED AT THAT TREMENDOUS SHORTHAND AND ALL IMPROVEMENT APPERTAINING TO IT IN MY SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO DORA AND HER AUNTS I WILL ONLY ADD TO WHAT I HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN OF MY PERSEVERANCE AT THIS TIME OF MY LIFE AND OF A PATIENT AND CONTINUOUS ENERGY WHICH THEN BEGAN TO BE MATURED WITHIN ME AND WHICH I KNOW TO BE THE STRONG PART OF MY CHARACTER IF IT HAVE ANY STRENGTH AT ALL THAT THERE ON LOOKING BACK I FIND THE SOURCE OF MY SUCCESS I HAVE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE IN WORLDLY MATTERS MANY MEN HAVE WORKED MUCH HARDER AND NOT SUCCEEDED HALF SO WELL BUT I NEVER COULD HAVE DONE WHAT I HAVE DONE WITHOUT THE HABITS OF PUNCTUALITY ORDER AND DILIGENCE WITHOUT THE DETERMINATION TO CONCENTRATE MYSELF ON ONE OBJECT AT A TIME NO MATTER HOW QUICKLY ITS SUCCESSOR SHOULD COME UPON ITS HEELS WHICH I THEN FORMED HEAVEN KNOWS I WRITE THIS IN NO SPIRIT OF SELFLAUDATION THE MAN WHO REVIEWS HIS OWN LIFE AS I DO MINE IN GOING ON HERE FROM PAGE TO PAGE HAD NEED TO HAVE BEEN A GOOD MAN INDEED IF HE WOULD BE SPARED THE SHARP CONSCIOUSNESS OF MANY TALENTS NEGLECTED MANY OPPORTUNITIES WASTED MANY ERRATIC AND PERVERTED FEELINGS CONSTANTLY AT WAR WITHIN HIS BREAST AND DEFEATING HIM I DO NOT HOLD ONE NATURAL GIFT I DARE SAY THAT I HAVE NOT ABUSED MY MEANING SIMPLY IS THAT WHATEVER I HAVE TRIED TO DO IN LIFE I HAVE TRIED WITH ALL MY HEART TO DO WELL THAT WHATEVER I HAVE DEVOTED MYSELF TO I HAVE DEVOTED MYSELF TO COMPLETELY THAT IN GREAT AIMS AND IN SMALL I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THOROUGHLY IN EARNEST I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY NATURAL OR IMPROVED ABILITY CAN CLAIM IMMUNITY FROM THE COMPANIONSHIP OF THE STEADY PLAIN HARDWORKING QUALITIES AND HOPE TO GAIN ITS END THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS SUCH FULFILMENT ON THIS EARTH SOME HAPPY TALENT AND SOME FORTUNATE OPPORTUNITY MAY FORM THE TWO SIDES OF THE LADDER ON WHICH SOME MEN MOUNT BUT THE ROUNDS OF THAT LADDER MUST BE MADE OF STUFF TO STAND WEAR AND TEAR AND THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THOROUGHGOING ARDENT AND SINCERE EARNESTNESS NEVER TO PUT ONE HAND TO ANYTHING ON WHICH I COULD THROW MY WHOLE SELF AND NEVER TO AFFECT DEPRECIATION OF MY WORK WHATEVER IT WAS I FIND NOW TO HAVE BEEN MY GOLDEN RULES HOW MUCH OF THE PRACTICE I HAVE JUST REDUCED TO PRECEPT I OWE TO AGNES I WILL NOT REPEAT HERE MY NARRATIVE PROCEEDS TO AGNES WITH A THANKFUL LOVE SHE CAME ON A VISIT OF A FORTNIGHT TO THE DOCTORS MR WICKFIELD WAS THE DOCTORS OLD FRIEND AND THE DOCTOR WISHED TO TALK WITH HIM AND DO HIM GOOD IT HAD BEEN MATTER OF CONVERSATION WITH AGNES WHEN SHE WAS LAST IN TOWN AND THIS VISIT WAS THE RESULT SHE

HIM I WAS SO REPELLED BY HIS ODIOUS BEHAVIOUR PARTICULARLY BY THIS CONCLUDING INSTANCE THAT I TURNED AWAY WITHOUT ANY CEREMONY AND LEFT HIM DOUBLED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN LIKE A SCARECROW IN WANT OF SUPPORT IT WAS NOT ON THAT EVENING BUT AS I WELL REMEMBER ON THE NEXT EVENING BUT ONE WHICH WAS A SUNDAY THAT I TOOK AGNES TO SEE DORA I HAD ARRANGED THE VISIT BEFOREHAND WITH MISS LAVINIA AND AGNES WAS EXPECTED TO TEA I WAS IN A FLUTTER OF PRIDE AND ANXIETY PRIDE IN MY DEAR LITTLE BETROTHED AND ANXIETY THAT AGNES SHOULD LIKE HER ALL THE WAY TO PUTNEY AGNES BEING INSIDE THE STAGECOACH AND I OUTSIDE I PICTURED DORA TO MYSELF IN EVERY ONE OF THE PRETTY LOOKS I KNEW SO WELL NOW MAKING UP MY MIND THAT I SHOULD LIKE HER TO LOOK EXACTLY AS SHE LOOKED AT SUCH A TIME AND THEN DOUBTING WHETHER I SHOULD NOT PREFER HER LOOKING AS SHE LOOKED AT SUCH ANOTHER TIME AND ALMOST WORRYING MYSELF INTO A FEVER ABOUT IT I WAS TROUBLED BY NO DOUBT OF HER BEING VERY PRETTY IN ANY CASE BUT IT FELL OUT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN HER LOOK SO WELL SHE WAS NOT IN THE DRAWINGROOM WHEN I PRESENTED AGNES TO HER LITTLE AUNTS BUT WAS SHYLY KEEPING OUT OF THE WAY I KNEW WHERE TO LOOK FOR HER NOW AND SURE ENOUGH I FOUND HER STOPPING HER EARS AGAIN BEHIND THE SAME DULL OLD DOOR AT FIRST SHE WOULDNT COME AT ALL AND THEN SHE PLEADED FOR FIVE MINUTES BY MY WATCH WHEN AT LENGTH SHE PUT HER ARM THROUGH MINE TO BE TAKEN TO THE DRAWINGROOM HER CHARMING LITTLE FACE WAS FLUSHED AND HAD NEVER BEEN SO PRETTY BUT WHEN WE WENT INTO THE ROOM AND IT TURNED PALE SHE WAS TEN THOUSAND TIMES PRETTIER YET DORA WAS AFRAID OF AGNES SHE HAD TOLD ME THAT SHE KNEW AGNES WAS TOO CLEVER BUT WHEN SHE SAW HER LOOKING AT ONCE SO CHEERFUL AND SO EARNEST AND SO THOUGHTFUL AND SO GOOD SHE GAVE A FAINT LITTLE CRY OF PLEASED SURPRISE AND JUST PUT HER AFFECTIONATE ARMS ROUND AGNESS NECK AND LAID HER INNOCENT CHEEK AGAINST HER FACE I NEVER WAS SO HAPPY I NEVER WAS SO PLEASED AS WHEN I SAW THOSE TWO SIT DOWN TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE AS WHEN I SAW MY LITTLE DARLING LOOKING UP SO NATURALLY TO THOSE CORDIAL EYES AS WHEN I SAW THE TENDER BEAUTIFUL REGARD WHICH AGNES CAST UPON HER MISS LAVINIA AND MISS CLARISSA PARTOOK IN THEIR WAY OF MY JOY IT WAS THE PLEASANTEST TEATABLE IN THE WORLD MISS CLARISSA PRESIDED I CUT AND HANDED THE SWEET SEEDCAKETHE LITTLE SISTERS HAD A BIRDLIKE FONDNESS FOR PICKING UP SEEDS AND PECKING AT SUGAR MISS LAVINIA LOOKED ON WITH BENIGNANT PATRONAGE AS IF OUR HAPPY LOVE WERE ALL HER WORK AND WE WERE PERFECTLY CONTENTED WITH OURSELVES AND ONE ANOTHER THE GENTLE CHEERFULNESS OF AGNES WENT TO ALL THEIR HEARTS HER QUIET INTEREST IN EVERYTHING THAT INTERESTED DORA HER MANNER OF MAKING ACQUAINTANCE WITH JIP WHO RESPONDED INSTANTLY HER PLEASANT WAY WHEN DORA WAS ASHAMED TO COME OVER TO HER USUAL SEAT BY ME HER MODEST GRACE AND EASE ELICITING A CROWD OF BLUSHING LITTLE MARKS OF CONFIDENCE FROM DORA SEEMED TO MAKE OUR CIRCLE QUITE COMPLETE I AM SO GLAD SAID DORA AFTER TEA THAT YOU LIKE ME I DIDNT THINK YOU WOULD AND I WANT MORE THAN EVER TO BE LIKED NOW JULIA MILLS IS GONE I HAVE OMITTED TO MENTION IT BY THE BY MISS MILLS HAD SAILED AND DORA AND I HAD GONE ABOARD A GREAT EAST INDIAMAN AT GRAVESEND TO SEE HER AND WE HAD HAD PRESERVED GINGER AND GUAVA AND OTHER DELICACIES OF THAT SORT FOR LUNCH AND WE HAD LEFT MISS MILLS WEEPING ON A CAMPSTOOL ON THE QUARTERDECK WITH A LARGE NEW DIARY UNDER HER ARM IN WHICH THE ORIGINAL REFLECTIONS AWAKENED BY THE CONTEMPLATION OF OCEAN WERE TO BE RECORDED UNDER LOCK AND KEY AGNES SAID SHE WAS AFRAID I MUST HAVE GIVEN HER AN UNPROMISING CHARACTER BUT DORA CORRECTED THAT DIRECTLY OH NO SHE SAID SHAKING HER CURLS AT ME IT WAS ALL PRAISE HE THINKS SO MUCH OF YOUR OPINION THAT I WAS QUITE AFRAID OF IT MY GOOD OPINION CANNOT STRENGTHEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO SOME PEOPLE WHOM HE KNOWS SAID AGNES WITH A SMILE IT IS NOT WORTH THEIR HAVING BUT PLEASE LET ME HAVE IT SAID DORA IN HER COAXING WAY IF YOU CAN WE MADE MERRY ABOUT DORAS WANTING TO BE LIKED AND DORA SAID I WAS A GOOSE AND SHE DIDNT LIKE ME AT ANY RATE AND THE SHORT EVENING FLEW AWAY ON GOSSAMERWINGS THE TIME WAS AT HAND WHEN THE COACH WAS TO CALL FOR US I WAS STANDING ALONE BEFORE THE FIRE WHEN DORA CAME STEALING SOFTLY IN TO GIVE ME THAT USUAL PRECIOUS LITTLE KISS BEFORE I WENT DONT YOU THINK IF I HAD HAD HER FOR A FRIEND A LONG TIME AGO DOADY SAID DORA HER BRIGHT EYES SHINING VERY BRIGHTLY AND HER LITTLE RIGHT HAND IDLY BUSYING ITSELF WITH ONE OF THE BUTTONS OF MY COAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE CLEVER PERHAPS MY LOVE SAID I WHAT NONSENSE DO YOU THINK IT IS NONSENSE RETURNED DORA WITHOUT LOOKING AT ME ARE YOU SURE IT IS OF COURSE I AM I HAVE FORGOTTEN SAID DORA STILL TURNING THE BUTTON ROUND AND ROUND WHAT RELATION AGNES IS TO YOU YOU DEAR BAD BOY NO BLOODRELATION I REPLIED BUT WE WERE BROUGHT UP TOGETHER LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER I WONDER WHY YOU EVER FELL IN LOVE WITH ME SAID DORA BEGINNING ON ANOTHER BUTTON OF MY COAT PERHAPS BECAUSE I COULDNT SEE YOU AND NOT LOVE YOU DORA SUPPOSE YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME AT ALL SAID DORA GOING TO ANOTHER BUTTON SUPPOSE WE HAD NEVER BEEN BORN SAID I GAILY I WONDERED WHAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT AS I GLANCED IN ADMIRING SILENCE AT THE LITTLE SOFT HAND TRAVELLING UP THE ROW OF BUTTONS ON MY COAT AND AT THE CLUSTERING HAIR THAT LAY AGAINST MY BREAST AND AT THE LASHES OF HER DOWNCAST EYES SLIGHTLY RISING AS THEY FOLLOWED HER IDLE FINGERS AT LENGTH HER EYES WERE LIFTED UP TO MINE AND SHE STOOD ON TIPTOE TO GIVE ME MORE THOUGHTFULLY THAN USUAL THAT PRECIOUS LITTLE KISSONCE TWICE THREE TIMESAND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM THEY ALL CAME BACK TOGETHER WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS AND DORAS UNUSUAL THOUGHTFULNESS WAS QUITE GONE THEN SHE WAS LAUGHINGLY RESOLVED TO PUT JIP THROUGH THE WHOLE OF HIS PERFORMANCES BEFORE THE COACH CAME THEY TOOK SOME TIME NOT SO MUCH ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR VARIETY AS JIPS RELUCTANCE AND WERE STILL UNFINISHED WHEN IT WAS HEARD AT THE DOOR THERE WAS A HURRIED BUT AFFECTIONATE PARTING BETWEEN AGNES AND HERSELF AND DORA WAS TO WRITE TO AGNES WHO WAS NOT TO MIND HER LETTERS BEING FOOLISH SHE SAID AND AGNES WAS TO WRITE TO DORA AND THEY HAD A SECOND PARTING AT THE COACH DOOR AND A THIRD WHEN DORA IN SPITE OF THE REMONSTRANCES OF MISS LAVINIA WOULD COME RUNNING OUT ONCE MORE TO REMIND AGNES AT THE COACH WINDOW ABOUT WRITING AND TO SHAKE HER CURLS AT ME ON THE BOX THE STAGECOACH WAS TO PUT US DOWN NEAR COVENT GARDEN WHERE WE WERE TO TAKE ANOTHER STAGECOACH FOR HIGHGATE I WAS IMPATIENT FOR THE SHORT WALK IN THE INTERVAL THAT AGNES MIGHT PRAISE DORA TO ME AH WHAT PRAISE IT WAS HOW LOVINGLY AND FERVENTLY DID IT COMMEND THE PRETTY CREATURE I HAD WON WITH ALL HER ARTLESS GRACES BEST DISPLAYED TO MY MOST GENTLE CARE HOW THOUGHTFULLY REMIND ME YET WITH NO PRETENCE OF DOING SO OF THE TRUST IN WHICH I HELD THE ORPHAN CHILD NEVER NEVER HAD I LOVED DORA SO DEEPLY AND TRULY AS I LOVED HER THAT NIGHT WHEN WE HAD AGAIN ALIGHTED AND WERE WALKING IN THE STARLIGHT ALONG THE QUIET ROAD THAT LED TO THE DOCTORS HOUSE I TOLD AGNES IT WAS HER DOING WHEN YOU WERE SITTING BY HER SAID I YOU SEEMED TO BE NO LESS HER GUARDIAN ANGEL THAN MINE AND YOU SEEM SO NOW AGNES A POOR ANGEL SHE RETURNED BUT FAITHFUL THE CLEAR TONE OF HER VOICE GOING STRAIGHT TO MY HEART MADE IT NATURAL TO ME TO SAY THE CHEERFULNESS THAT BELONGS TO YOU AGNES AND TO NO ONE ELSE THAT EVER I HAVE SEEN IS SO RESTORED I HAVE OBSERVED TODAY THAT I HAVE BEGUN TO HOPE YOU ARE HAPPIER AT HOME I AM HAPPIER IN MYSELF SHE SAID I AM QUITE CHEERFUL AND LIGHTHEARTED I GLANCED AT THE SERENE FACE LOOKING UPWARD AND THOUGHT IT WAS THE STARS THAT MADE IT SEEM SO NOBLE THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE AT HOME SAID AGNES AFTER A FEW MOMENTS NO FRESH REFERENCE SAID I TOI WOULDNT DISTRESS YOU AGNES BUT I CANNOT HELP ASKINGTO WHAT WE SPOKE OF WHEN WE PARTED LAST NO NONE SHE ANSWERED I HAVE THOUGHT SO MUCH ABOUT IT YOU MUST THINK LESS ABOUT IT REMEMBER THAT I CONFIDE IN SIMPLE LOVE AND TRUTH AT LAST HAVE NO APPREHENSIONS FOR ME TROTWOOD SHE ADDED AFTER A MOMENT THE STEP YOU DREAD MY TAKING I SHALL NEVER TAKE ALTHOUGH I THINK I HAD NEVER REALLY FEARED IT IN ANY SEASON OF COOL REFLECTION IT WAS AN UNSPEAKABLE RELIEF TO ME TO HAVE THIS ASSURANCE FROM HER OWN TRUTHFUL LIPS I TOLD HER SO EARNESTLY AND WHEN THIS VISIT IS OVER SAID IFOR WE MAY NOT BE ALONE ANOTHER TIMEHOW LONG IS IT LIKELY TO BE MY DEAR AGNES BEFORE YOU COME TO LONDON

SHALL FREQUENTLY HEAR OF ONE ANOTHER THAT WAY WE WERE NOW WITHIN THE LITTLE COURTYARD OF THE DOCTORS COTTAGE IT WAS GROWING LATE THERE WAS A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW OF MRS STRONGS CHAMBER AND AGNES POINTING TO IT BADE ME GOOD NIGHT DO NOT BE TROUBLED SHE SAID GIVING ME HER HAND BY OUR MISFORTUNES AND ANXIETIES I CAN BE HAPPIER IN NOTHING THAN IN YOUR HAPPINESS IF YOU CAN EVER GIVE ME HELP RELY UPON IT I WILL ASK YOU FOR IT GOD BLESS YOU ALWAYS IN HER BEAMING SMILE AND IN THESE LAST TONES OF HER CHEERFUL VOICE I SEEMED AGAIN TO SEE AND HEAR MY LITTLE DORA IN HER COMPANY I STOOD AWHILE LOOKING THROUGH THE PORCH AT THE STARS WITH A HEART FULL OF LOVE AND GRATITUDE AND THEN WALKED SLOWLY FORTH I HAD ENGAGED A BED AT A DECENT ALEHOUSE CLOSE BY AND WAS GOING OUT AT THE GATE WHEN HAPPENING TO TURN MY HEAD I SAW A LIGHT IN THE DOCTORS STUDY A HALFREPROACHFUL FANCY CAME INTO MY MIND THAT HE HAD BEEN WORKING AT THE DICTIONARY WITHOUT MY HELP WITH THE VIEW OF SEEING IF THIS WERE SO AND IN ANY CASE OF BIDDING HIM GOOD NIGHT IF HE WERE YET SITTING AMONG HIS BOOKS I TURNED BACK AND GOING SOFTLY ACROSS THE HALL AND GENTLY OPENING THE DOOR LOOKED IN THE FIRST PERSON WHOM I SAW TO MY SURPRISE BY THE SOBER LIGHT OF THE SHADED LAMP WAS URIAH HE WAS STANDING CLOSE BESIDE IT WITH ONE OF HIS SKELETON HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH AND THE OTHER RESTING ON THE DOCTORS TABLE THE DOCTOR SAT IN HIS STUDY CHAIR COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS MR WICKFIELD SORELY TROUBLED AND DISTRESSED WAS LEANING FORWARD IRRESOLUTELY TOUCHING THE DOCTORS ARM FOR AN INSTANT I SUPPOSED THAT THE DOCTOR WAS ILL I HASTILY ADVANCED A STEP UNDER THAT IMPRESSION WHEN I MET URIAHS EYE AND SAW WHAT WAS THE MATTER I WOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN BUT THE DOCTOR MADE A GESTURE TO DETAIN ME AND I REMAINED AT ANY RATE OBSERVED URIAH WITH A WRITHE OF HIS UNGAINLY PERSON WE MAY KEEP THE DOOR SHUT WE NEEDNT MAKE IT KNOWN TO ALL THE TOWN SAYING WHICH HE WENT ON HIS TOES TO THE DOOR WHICH I HAD LEFT OPEN AND CAREFULLY CLOSED IT HE THEN CAME BACK AND TOOK UP HIS FORMER POSITION THERE WAS AN OBTRUSIVE SHOW OF COMPASSIONATE ZEAL IN HIS VOICE AND MANNER MORE INTOLERABLEAT LEAST TO METHAN ANY DEMEANOUR HE COULD HAVE ASSUMED I HAVE FELT IT INCUMBENT UPON ME MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID URIAH TO POINT OUT TO DOCTOR STRONG WHAT YOU AND ME HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT YOU DIDNT EXACTLY UNDERSTAND ME THOUGH I GAVE HIM A LOOK BUT NO OTHER ANSWER AND GOING TO MY GOOD OLD MASTER SAID A FEW WORDS THAT I MEANT TO BE WORDS OF COMFORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT HE PUT HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER AS IT HAD BEEN HIS CUSTOM TO DO WHEN I WAS QUITE A LITTLE FELLOW BUT DID NOT LIFT HIS GREY HEAD AS YOU DIDNT UNDERSTAND ME MASTER COPPERFIELD RESUMED URIAH IN THE SAME OFFICIOUS MANNER I MAY TAKE THE LIBERTY OF UMBLY MENTIONING BEING AMONG FRIENDS THAT I HAVE CALLED DOCTOR STRONGS ATTENTION TO THE GOINGSON OF MRS STRONG ITS MUCH AGAINST THE GRAIN WITH ME I ASSURE YOU COPPERFIELD TO BE CONCERNED IN ANYTHING SO UNPLEASANT BUT REALLY AS IT IS WERE ALL MIXING OURSELVES UP WITH WHAT OUGHTNT TO BE THAT WAS WHAT MY MEANING WAS SIR WHEN YOU DIDNT UNDERSTAND ME I WONDER NOW WHEN I RECALL HIS LEER THAT I DID NOT COLLAR HIM AND TRY TO SHAKE THE BREATH OUT OF HIS BODY I DARE SAY I DIDNT MAKE MYSELF VERY CLEAR HE WENT ON NOR YOU NEITHER NATURALLY WE WAS BOTH OF US INCLINED TO GIVE SUCH A SUBJECT A WIDE BERTH HOWSEVER AT LAST I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND TO SPEAK PLAIN AND I HAVE MENTIONED TO DOCTOR STRONG THATDID YOU SPEAK SIR THIS WAS TO THE DOCTOR WHO HAD MOANED THE SOUND MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED ANY HEART I THOUGHT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT UPON URIAHS MENTIONED TO DOCTOR STRONG HE PROCEEDED THAT ANYONE MAY SEE THAT MR MALDON AND THE LOVELY AND AGREEABLE LADY AS IS DOCTOR STRONGS WIFE ARE TOO SWEET ON ONE ANOTHER REALLY THE TIME IS COME WE BEING AT PRESENT ALL MIXING OURSELVES UP WITH WHAT OUGHTNT TO BE WHEN DOCTOR STRONG MUST BE TOLD THAT THIS WAS FULL AS PLAIN TO EVERYBODY AS THE SUN BEFORE MR MALDON WENT TO INDIA THAT MR MALDON MADE EXCUSES

NO NO NO RETURNED THE DOCTOR IN A TONE OF MOST PATHETIC GRIEF I THOUGHT AT ONE TIME SAID MR WICKFIELD THAT YOU WISHED TO SEND MALDON ABROAD TO EFFECT A DESIRABLE SEPARATION NO NO NO RETURNED THE DOCTOR TO GIVE ANNIE PLEASURE BY MAKING SOME PROVISION FOR THE COMPANION OF HER CHILDHOOD NOTHING ELSE SO I FOUND SAID MR WICKFIELD I COULDNT DOUBT IT WHEN YOU TOLD ME SO BUT I THOUGHTI IMPLORE YOU TO REMEMBER THE NARROW CONSTRUCTION WHICH HAS BEEN MY BESETTING SINTHAT IN A CASE WHERE THERE WAS SO MUCH DISPARITY IN POINT OF YEARS THATS THE WAY TO PUT IT YOU SEE MASTER COPPERFIELD OBSERVED URIAH WITH FAWNING AND OFFENSIVE PITY A LADY OF SUCH YOUTH AND SUCH ATTRACTIONS HOWEVER REAL HER RESPECT FOR YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED IN MARRYING BY WORLDLY CONSIDERATIONS ONLY I MAKE NO ALLOWANCE FOR INNUMERABLE FEELINGS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY HAVE ALL TENDED TO GOOD FOR HEAVENS SAKE REMEMBER THAT HOW KIND HE PUTS IT SAID URIAH SHAKING HIS HEAD ALWAYS OBSERVING HER FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW SAID MR WICKFIELD BUT BY ALL THAT IS DEAR TO YOU MY OLD FRIEND I ENTREAT YOU TO CONSIDER WHAT IT WAS I AM FORCED TO CONFESS NOW HAVING NO ESCAPE NO THERES NO WAY OUT OF IT MR WICKFIELD SIR OBSERVED URIAH WHEN ITS GOT TO THIS THAT I DID SAID MR WICKFIELD GLANCING HELPLESSLY AND DISTRACTEDLY AT HIS PARTNER THAT I DID DOUBT HER AND THINK HER WANTING IN HER DUTY TO YOU AND THAT I DID SOMETIMES IF I MUST SAY ALL FEEL AVERSE TO AGNES BEING IN SUCH A FAMILIAR RELATION TOWARDS HER AS TO SEE WHAT I SAW OR IN MY DISEASED THEORY FANCIED THAT I SAW I NEVER MENTIONED THIS TO ANYONE I NEVER MEANT IT TO BE KNOWN TO ANYONE AND THOUGH IT IS TERRIBLE TO YOU TO HEAR SAID MR WICKFIELD QUITE SUBDUED IF YOU KNEW HOW TERRIBLE IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU WOULD FEEL COMPASSION FOR ME THE DOCTOR IN THE PERFECT GOODNESS OF HIS NATURE PUT OUT HIS HAND MR WICKFIELD HELD IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE IN HIS WITH HIS HEAD BOWED DOWN I AM SURE SAID URIAH WRITHING HIMSELF INTO THE SILENCE LIKE A CONGEREEL THAT THIS IS A SUBJECT FULL OF UNPLEASANTNESS TO EVERYBODY BUT SINCE WE HAVE GOT SO FAR I OUGHT TO TAKE THE LIBERTY OF MENTIONING THAT COPPERFIELD HAS NOTICED IT TOO I TURNED UPON HIM AND ASKED HIM HOW HE DARED REFER TO ME OH ITS VERY KIND OF YOU COPPERFIELD RETURNED URIAH UNDULATING ALL OVER AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT AN AMIABLE CHARACTER YOURS IS BUT YOU KNOW THAT THE MOMENT I SPOKE TO YOU THE OTHER NIGHT YOU KNEW WHAT I MEANT YOU KNOW YOU KNEW WHAT I MEANT COPPERFIELD DONT DENY IT YOU DENY IT WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS BUT DONT DO IT COPPERFIELD I SAW THE MILD EYE OF THE GOOD OLD DOCTOR TURNED UPON ME FOR A MOMENT AND I FELT THAT THE CONFESSION OF MY OLD MISGIVINGS AND REMEMBRANCES WAS TOO PLAINLY WRITTEN IN MY FACE TO BE OVERLOOKED IT WAS OF NO USE RAGING I COULD NOT UNDO THAT SAY WHAT I WOULD I COULD NOT UNSAY IT WE WERE SILENT AGAIN AND REMAINED SO UNTIL THE DOCTOR ROSE AND WALKED TWICE OR THRICE ACROSS THE ROOM PRESENTLY HE RETURNED TO WHERE HIS CHAIR STOOD AND LEANING ON THE BACK OF IT AND OCCASIONALLY PUTTING HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO HIS EYES WITH A SIMPLE HONESTY THAT DID HIM MORE HONOUR TO MY THINKING THAN ANY DISGUISE HE COULD HAVE EFFECTED SAID I HAVE BEEN MUCH TO BLAME I BELIEVE I HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH TO BLAME I HAVE EXPOSED ONE WHOM I HOLD IN MY HEART TO TRIALS AND ASPERSIONSI CALL THEM ASPERSIONS EVEN TO HAVE BEEN CONCEIVED IN ANYBODYS INMOST MINDOF WHICH SHE NEVER BUT FOR ME COULD HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT URIAH HEEP GAVE A KIND OF SNIVEL I THINK TO EXPRESS SYMPATHY OF WHICH MY ANNIE SAID THE DOCTOR NEVER BUT FOR ME COULD HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT GENTLEMEN I AM OLD NOW AS YOU KNOW I DO NOT FEEL TONIGHT THAT I HAVE MUCH TO LIVE FOR BUT MY LIFEMY LIFEUPON THE TRUTH AND HONOUR OF THE DEAR LADY WHO HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF THIS CONVERSATION I DO NOT THINK THAT THE BEST EMBODIMENT OF CHIVALRY THE REALIZATION OF THE HANDSOMEST AND MOST ROMANTIC FIGURE EVER IMAGINED BY PAINTER COULD HAVE SAID THIS WITH A MORE IMPRESSIVE AND AFFECTING DIGNITY THAN THE PLAIN OLD DOCTOR DID BUT I AM NOT PREPARED HE WENT ON TO DENYPERHAPS I MAY HAVE BEEN WITHOUT KNOWING IT IN SOME DEGREE PREPARED TO ADMITTHAT I MAY HAVE UNWITTINGLY ENSNARED THAT LADY INTO AN UNHAPPY MARRIAGE I AM A MAN QUITE UNACCUSTOMED TO OBSERVE AND I CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT THE OBSERVATION OF SEVERAL PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT AGES AND POSITIONS ALL TOO PLAINLY TENDING IN ONE DIRECTION AND THAT SO NATURAL IS BETTER THAN MINE I HAD OFTEN ADMIRED AS I HAVE ELSEWHERE DESCRIBED HIS BENIGNANT MANNER TOWARDS HIS YOUTHFUL WIFE BUT THE RESPECTFUL TENDERNESS HE MANIFESTED IN EVERY REFERENCE TO HER ON THIS OCCASION AND THE ALMOST REVERENTIAL MANNER IN WHICH HE PUT AWAY FROM HIM THE LIGHTEST DOUBT OF HER INTEGRITY EXALTED HIM IN MY EYES BEYOND DESCRIPTION I MARRIED THAT LADY SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN SHE WAS EXTREMELY YOUNG I TOOK HER TO MYSELF WHEN HER CHARACTER WAS SCARCELY FORMED SO FAR AS IT WAS DEVELOPED IT HAD BEEN MY HAPPINESS TO FORM IT I KNEW HER FATHER WELL I KNEW HER WELL I HAD TAUGHT HER WHAT I COULD FOR THE LOVE OF ALL HER BEAUTIFUL AND VIRTUOUS QUALITIES IF I DID HER WRONG AS I FEAR I DID IN TAKING ADVANTAGE BUT I NEVER MEANT IT OF HER GRATITUDE AND HER AFFECTION I ASK PARDON OF THAT LADY IN MY HEART HE WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM AND CAME BACK TO THE SAME PLACE HOLDING THE CHAIR WITH A GRASP THAT TREMBLED LIKE HIS SUBDUED VOICE IN ITS EARNESTNESS I REGARDED MYSELF AS A REFUGE FOR HER FROM THE DANGERS AND VICISSITUDES OF LIFE I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT UNEQUAL THOUGH WE WERE IN YEARS SHE WOULD LIVE TRANQUILLY AND CONTENTEDLY WITH ME I DID NOT SHUT OUT OF MY CONSIDERATION THE TIME WHEN I SHOULD LEAVE HER FREE AND STILL YOUNG AND STILL BEAUTIFUL BUT WITH HER JUDGEMENT MORE MATUREDNO GENTLEMENUPON MY TRUTH HIS HOMELY FIGURE SEEMED TO BE LIGHTENED UP BY HIS FIDELITY AND GENEROSITY EVERY WORD HE UTTERED HAD A FORCE THAT NO OTHER GRACE COULD HAVE IMPARTED TO IT MY LIFE WITH THIS LADY HAS BEEN VERY HAPPY UNTIL TONIGHT I HAVE HAD UNINTERRUPTED OCCASION TO BLESS THE DAY ON WHICH I DID HER GREAT INJUSTICE HIS VOICE MORE AND MORE FALTERING IN THE UTTERANCE OF THESE WORDS STOPPED FOR A FEW MOMENTS THEN HE WENT ON ONCE AWAKENED FROM MY DREAMI HAVE BEEN A POOR DREAMER IN ONE WAY OR OTHER ALL MY LIFEI SEE HOW NATURAL IT IS THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SOME REGRETFUL FEELING TOWARDS HER OLD COMPANION AND HER EQUAL THAT SHE DOES REGARD HIM WITH SOME INNOCENT REGRET WITH SOME BLAMELESS THOUGHTS OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT FOR ME IS I FEAR TOO TRUE MUCH THAT I HAVE SEEN BUT NOT NOTED HAS COME BACK UPON ME WITH NEW MEANING DURING THIS LAST TRYING HOUR BUT BEYOND THIS GENTLEMEN THE DEAR LADYS NAME NEVER MUST BE COUPLED WITH A WORD A BREATH OF DOUBT FOR A LITTLE WHILE HIS EYE KINDLED AND HIS VOICE WAS FIRM FOR A LITTLE WHILE HE WAS AGAIN SILENT PRESENTLY HE PROCEEDED AS BEFORE IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO BEAR THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNHAPPINESS I HAVE OCCASIONED AS SUBMISSIVELY AS I CAN IT IS SHE WHO SHOULD REPROACH NOT I TO SAVE HER FROM MISCONSTRUCTION CRUEL MISCONSTRUCTION THAT EVEN MY FRIENDS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO AVOID BECOMES MY DUTY THE MORE RETIRED WE LIVE THE BETTER I SHALL DISCHARGE IT AND WHEN THE TIME COMESMAY IT COME SOON IF IT BE HIS MERCIFUL PLEASUREWHEN MY DEATH SHALL RELEASE HER FROM CONSTRAINT I SHALL CLOSE MY EYES UPON HER HONOURED FACE WITH UNBOUNDED CONFIDENCE AND LOVE AND LEAVE HER WITH NO SORROW THEN TO HAPPIER AND BRIGHTER DAYS I COULD NOT SEE HIM FOR THE TEARS WHICH HIS EARNESTNESS AND GOODNESS SO ADORNED BY AND SO ADORNING THE PERFECT SIMPLICITY OF HIS MANNER BROUGHT INTO MY EYES HE HAD MOVED TO THE DOOR WHEN HE ADDED GENTLEMEN I HAVE SHOWN YOU MY HEART I AM SURE YOU WILL RESPECT IT WHAT WE HAVE SAID TONIGHT IS NEVER TO BE SAID MORE WICKFIELD GIVE ME AN OLD FRIENDS ARM UPSTAIRS MR WICKFIELD HASTENED TO HIM WITHOUT INTERCHANGING A WORD THEY WENT SLOWLY OUT OF THE ROOM TOGETHER URIAH LOOKING AFTER THEM WELL MASTER COPPERFIELD SAID URIAH MEEKLY TURNING TO ME THE THING HASNT TOOK QUITE THE TURN THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FOR THE OLD SCHOLARWHAT AN EXCELLENT MANIS AS BLIND AS A BRICKBAT BUT THIS FAMILYS OUT OF THE CART I THINK I NEEDED BUT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TO BE SO MADLY ENRAGED AS I NEVER WAS BEFORE AND NEVER HAVE BEEN SINCE YOU VILLAIN SAID I WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ENTRAPPING ME INTO YOUR SCHEMES HOW DARE YOU APPEAL TO ME JUST NOW YOU FALSE RASCAL AS IF WE HAD BEEN IN DISCUSSION TOGETHER AS WE STOOD FRONT TO FRONT I SAW SO PLAINLY IN THE STEALTHY EXULTATION OF HIS FACE WHAT I ALREADY SO PLAINLY KNEW I MEAN THAT HE FORCED HIS CONFIDENCE UPON ME EXPRESSLY TO MAKE ME MISERABLE AND HAD SET A DELIBERATE TRAP FOR ME IN THIS VERY MATTER THAT I COULDNT BEAR IT THE WHOLE OF HIS LANK CHEEK WAS INVITINGLY BEFORE ME AND I STRUCK IT WITH MY OPEN HAND WITH THAT FORCE THAT MY FINGERS TINGLED AS IF I HAD BURNT THEM HE CAUGHT THE HAND IN HIS AND WE STOOD IN THAT CONNEXION LOOKING AT EACH OTHER WE STOOD SO A LONG TIME LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE THE WHITE MARKS OF MY FINGERS DIE OUT OF THE DEEP RED OF HIS CHEEK AND LEAVE IT A DEEPER RED COPPERFIELD HE SAID AT LENGTH IN A BREATHLESS VOICE HAVE YOU TAKEN LEAVE OF YOUR SENSES I HAVE TAKEN LEAVE OF YOU SAID I WRESTING MY HAND AWAY YOU DOG ILL KNOW NO MORE OF YOU WONT YOU SAID HE CONSTRAINED BY THE PAIN OF HIS CHEEK TO PUT HIS HAND THERE PERHAPS YOU WONT BE ABLE TO HELP IT ISNT THIS UNGRATEFUL OF YOU NOW I HAVE SHOWN YOU OFTEN ENOUGH SAID I THAT I DESPISE YOU I HAVE SHOWN YOU NOW MORE PLAINLY THAT I DO WHY SHOULD I DREAD YOUR DOING YOUR WORST TO ALL ABOUT YOU WHAT ELSE DO YOU EVER DO HE PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THIS ALLUSION TO THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT HAD HITHERTO RESTRAINED ME IN MY COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIM I RATHER THINK THAT NEITHER THE BLOW NOR THE ALLUSION WOULD HAVE ESCAPED ME BUT FOR THE ASSURANCE I HAD HAD FROM AGNES THAT NIGHT IT IS NO MATTER THERE WAS ANOTHER LONG PAUSE HIS EYES AS HE LOOKED AT ME SEEMED TO TAKE EVERY SHADE OF COLOUR THAT COULD MAKE EYES UGLY COPPERFIELD HE SAID REMOVING HIS HAND FROM HIS CHEEK YOU HAVE ALWAYS GONE AGAINST ME I KNOW YOU ALWAYS USED TO BE AGAINST ME AT MR WICKFIELDS YOU MAY THINK WHAT YOU LIKE SAID I STILL IN A TOWERING RAGE IF IT IS NOT TRUE SO MUCH THE WORTHIER YOU AND YET I ALWAYS LIKED YOU COPPERFIELD HE REJOINED I DEIGNED TO MAKE HIM NO REPLY AND TAKING UP MY HAT WAS GOING OUT TO BED WHEN HE CAME BETWEEN ME AND THE DOOR COPPERFIELD HE SAID THERE MUST BE TWO PARTIES TO A QUARREL I WONT BE ONE YOU MAY GO TO THE DEVIL SAID I DONT SAY THAT HE REPLIED I KNOW YOULL BE SORRY AFTERWARDS HOW CAN YOU MAKE YOURSELF SO INFERIOR TO ME AS TO SHOW SUCH A BAD SPIRIT BUT I FORGIVE YOU YOU FORGIVE ME I REPEATED DISDAINFULLY I DO AND YOU CANT HELP YOURSELF REPLIED URIAH TO THINK OF YOUR GOING AND ATTACKING ME THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FRIEND TO YOU BUT THERE CANT BE A QUARREL WITHOUT TWO PARTIES AND I WONT BE ONE I WILL BE A FRIEND TO YOU IN SPITE OF YOU SO NOW YOU KNOW WHAT YOUVE GOT TO EXPECT THE NECESSITY OF CARRYING ON THIS DIALOGUE HIS PART IN WHICH WAS VERY SLOW MINE VERY QUICK IN A LOW TONE THAT THE HOUSE MIGHT NOT BE DISTURBED AT AN UNSEASONABLE HOUR DID NOT IMPROVE MY TEMPER THOUGH MY PASSION WAS COOLING DOWN MERELY TELLING HIM THAT I SHOULD EXPECT FROM HIM WHAT I ALWAYS HAD EXPECTED AND HAD NEVER YET BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN I OPENED THE DOOR UPON HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN A GREAT WALNUT PUT THERE TO BE CRACKED AND WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE BUT HE SLEPT OUT OF THE HOUSE TOO AT HIS MOTHERS LODGING AND BEFORE I HAD GONE MANY HUNDRED YARDS CAME UP WITH ME YOU KNOW COPPERFIELD HE SAID IN MY EAR I DID NOT TURN MY HEAD YOURE IN QUITE A WRONG POSITION WHICH I FELT TO BE TRUE AND THAT MADE ME CHAFE THE MORE YOU CANT MAKE THIS A BRAVE THING AND YOU CANT HELP BEING FORGIVEN I DONT INTEND TO MENTION IT TO MOTHER NOR TO ANY LIVING SOUL IM DETERMINED TO FORGIVE YOU BUT I DO WONDER THAT YOU SHOULD LIFT YOUR HAND AGAINST A PERSON THAT YOU KNEW TO BE SO UMBLE I FELT ONLY LESS MEAN THAN HE HE KNEW ME BETTER THAN I KNEW MYSELF IF HE HAD RETORTED OR OPENLY EXASPERATED ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A RELIEF AND A JUSTIFICATION BUT HE HAD PUT ME ON A SLOW FIRE ON WHICH I LAY TORMENTED HALF THE NIGHT IN THE MORNING WHEN I CAME OUT THE EARLY CHURCHBELL WAS RINGING AND HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN WITH HIS MOTHER HE ADDRESSED ME AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED AND I COULD DO NO LESS THAN REPLY I HAD STRUCK HIM HARD ENOUGH TO GIVE HIM THE TOOTHACHE I SUPPOSE AT ALL EVENTS HIS FACE WAS TIED UP IN A BLACK SILK HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WITH HIS HAT PERCHED ON THE TOP OF IT WAS FAR FROM IMPROVING HIS APPEARANCE I HEARD THAT HE WENT TO A DENTISTS IN LONDON ON THE MONDAY MORNING AND HAD A TOOTH OUT I HOPE IT WAS A DOUBLE ONE THE DOCTOR GAVE OUT THAT HE WAS NOT QUITE WELL AND REMAINED ALONE FOR A CONSIDERABLE PART OF EVERY DAY DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE VISIT AGNES AND HER FATHER HAD BEEN GONE A WEEK BEFORE WE RESUMED OUR USUAL WORK ON THE DAY PRECEDING ITS RESUMPTION THE DOCTOR GAVE ME WITH HIS OWN HANDS A FOLDED NOTE NOT SEALED IT WAS ADDRESSED TO MYSELF AND LAID AN INJUNCTION ON ME IN A FEW AFFECTIONATE WORDS NEVER TO REFER TO THE SUBJECT OF THAT EVENING I HAD CONFIDED IT TO MY AUNT BUT TO NO ONE ELSE IT WAS NOT A SUBJECT I COULD DISCUSS WITH AGNES AND AGNES CERTAINLY HAD NOT THE LEAST SUSPICION OF WHAT HAD PASSED NEITHER I FELT CONVINCED HAD MRS STRONG THEN SEVERAL WEEKS ELAPSED BEFORE I SAW THE LEAST CHANGE IN HER IT CAME ON SLOWLY LIKE A CLOUD WHEN THERE IS NO WIND AT FIRST SHE SEEMED TO WONDER AT THE GENTLE COMPASSION WITH WHICH THE DOCTOR SPOKE TO HER AND AT HIS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE HER MOTHER WITH HER TO RELIEVE THE DULL MONOTONY OF HER LIFE OFTEN WHEN WE WERE AT WORK AND SHE WAS SITTING BY I WOULD SEE HER PAUSING AND LOOKING AT HIM WITH THAT MEMORABLE FACE AFTERWARDS I SOMETIMES OBSERVED HER RISE WITH HER EYES FULL OF TEARS AND GO OUT OF THE ROOM GRADUALLY AN UNHAPPY SHADOW FELL UPON HER BEAUTY AND DEEPENED EVERY DAY MRS MARKLEHAM WAS A REGULAR INMATE OF THE COTTAGE THEN BUT SHE TALKED AND TALKED AND SAW NOTHING AS THIS CHANGE STOLE ON ANNIE ONCE LIKE SUNSHINE IN THE DOCTORS HOUSE THE DOCTOR BECAME OLDER IN APPEARANCE AND MORE GRAVE BUT THE SWEETNESS OF HIS TEMPER THE PLACID KINDNESS OF HIS MANNER AND HIS BENEVOLENT SOLICITUDE FOR HER IF THEY WERE CAPABLE OF ANY INCREASE WERE INCREASED I SAW HIM ONCE EARLY ON THE MORNING OF HER BIRTHDAY WHEN SHE CAME TO SIT IN THE WINDOW WHILE WE WERE AT WORK WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS DONE BUT NOW BEGAN TO DO WITH A TIMID AND UNCERTAIN AIR THAT I THOUGHT VERY TOUCHING TAKE HER FOREHEAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS KISS IT AND GO HURRIEDLY AWAY TOO MUCH MOVED TO REMAIN I SAW HER STAND WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER LIKE A STATUE AND THEN BEND DOWN HER HEAD AND CLASP HER HANDS AND WEEP I CANNOT SAY HOW SORROWFULLY SOMETIMES AFTER THAT I FANCIED THAT SHE TRIED TO SPEAK EVEN TO ME IN INTERVALS WHEN WE WERE LEFT ALONE BUT SHE NEVER UTTERED A WORD THE DOCTOR ALWAYS HAD SOME NEW PROJECT FOR HER PARTICIPATING IN AMUSEMENTS AWAY FROM HOME WITH HER MOTHER AND MRS MARKLEHAM WHO WAS VERY FOND OF AMUSEMENTS AND VERY EASILY DISSATISFIED WITH ANYTHING ELSE ENTERED INTO THEM WITH GREAT GOODWILL AND WAS LOUD IN HER COMMENDATIONS BUT ANNIE IN A SPIRITLESS UNHAPPY WAY ONLY WENT WHITHER SHE WAS LED AND SEEMED TO HAVE NO CARE FOR ANYTHING I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK NEITHER DID MY AUNT WHO MUST HAVE WALKED AT VARIOUS TIMES A HUNDRED MILES IN HER UNCERTAINTY WHAT WAS STRANGEST OF ALL WAS THAT THE ONLY REAL RELIEF WHICH SEEMED TO MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE SECRET REGION OF THIS DOMESTIC UNHAPPINESS MADE ITS WAY THERE IN THE PERSON OF MR DICK WHAT HIS THOUGHTS WERE ON THE SUBJECT OR WHAT HIS OBSERVATION WAS I AM AS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN AS I DARE SAY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ASSIST ME IN THE TASK BUT AS I HAVE RECORDED IN THE NARRATIVE OF MY SCHOOL DAYS HIS VENERATION FOR THE DOCTOR WAS UNBOUNDED AND THERE IS A SUBTLETY OF PERCEPTION IN REAL ATTACHMENT EVEN WHEN IT IS BORNE TOWARDS MAN BY ONE OF THE LOWER ANIMALS WHICH LEAVES THE HIGHEST INTELLECT BEHIND TO THIS MIND OF THE HEART IF I MAY CALL IT SO IN MR DICK SOME BRIGHT RAY OF THE TRUTH SHOT STRAIGHT HE HAD PROUDLY RESUMED HIS PRIVILEGE IN MANY OF HIS SPARE HOURS OF WALKING UP AND DOWN THE GARDEN WITH THE DOCTOR AS HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO PACE UP AND DOWN THE DOCTORS WALK AT CANTERBURY BUT MATTERS WERE NO SOONER IN THIS STATE THAN HE DEVOTED ALL HIS SPARE TIME AND GOT UP EARLIER TO MAKE IT MORE TO THESE PERAMBULATIONS IF HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS WHEN THE DOCTOR READ THAT MARVELLOUS PERFORMANCE THE DICTIONARY TO HIM HE WAS NOW QUITE MISERABLE UNLESS THE DOCTOR PULLED IT OUT OF HIS POCKET AND BEGAN WHEN THE DOCTOR AND I WERE ENGAGED HE NOW FELL INTO THE CUSTOM OF WALKING UP AND DOWN WITH MRS STRONG AND HELPING HER TO TRIM HER FAVOURITE FLOWERS OR WEED THE BEDS I DARE SAY HE RARELY SPOKE A DOZEN WORDS IN AN HOUR BUT HIS QUIET INTEREST AND HIS WISTFUL FACE FOUND IMMEDIATE RESPONSE IN BOTH THEIR BREASTS EACH KNEW THAT THE OTHER LIKED HIM AND THAT HE LOVED BOTH AND HE BECAME WHAT NO ONE ELSE COULD BEA LINK BETWEEN THEM WHEN I THINK OF HIM WITH HIS IMPENETRABLY WISE FACE WALKING UP AND DOWN WITH THE DOCTOR DELIGHTED TO BE BATTERED BY THE HARD WORDS IN THE DICTIONARY WHEN I THINK OF HIM CARRYING HUGE WATERINGPOTS AFTER ANNIE KNEELING DOWN IN VERY PAWS OF GLOVES AT PATIENT MICROSCOPIC WORK AMONG THE LITTLE LEAVES EXPRESSING AS NO PHILOSOPHER COULD HAVE EXPRESSED IN EVERYTHING HE DID A DELICATE DESIRE TO BE HER FRIEND SHOWERING SYMPATHY TRUSTFULNESS AND AFFECTION OUT OF EVERY HOLE IN THE WATERINGPOT WHEN I THINK OF HIM NEVER WANDERING IN THAT BETTER MIND OF HIS TO WHICH UNHAPPINESS ADDRESSED ITSELF NEVER BRINGING THE UNFORTUNATE KING CHARLES INTO THE GARDEN NEVER WAVERING IN HIS GRATEFUL SERVICE NEVER DIVERTED FROM HIS KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG OR FROM HIS WISH TO SET IT RIGHTI REALLY FEEL ALMOST ASHAMED OF HAVING KNOWN THAT HE WAS NOT QUITE IN HIS WITS TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE UTMOST I HAVE DONE WITH MINE NOBODY BUT MYSELF TROT KNOWS WHAT THAT MAN IS MY AUNT WOULD PROUDLY REMARK WHEN WE CONVERSED ABOUT IT DICK WILL DISTINGUISH HIMSELF YET I MUST REFER TO ONE OTHER TOPIC BEFORE I CLOSE THIS CHAPTER WHILE THE VISIT AT THE DOCTORS WAS STILL IN PROGRESS I OBSERVED THAT THE POSTMAN BROUGHT TWO OR THREE LETTERS EVERY MORNING FOR URIAH HEEP WHO REMAINED AT HIGHGATE UNTIL THE REST WENT BACK IT BEING A LEISURE TIME AND THAT THESE WERE ALWAYS DIRECTED IN A BUSINESSLIKE MANNER BY MR MICAWBER WHO NOW ASSUMED A ROUND LEGAL HAND I WAS GLAD TO INFER FROM THESE SLIGHT PREMISES THAT MR MICAWBER WAS DOING WELL AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS MUCH SURPRISED TO RECEIVE ABOUT THIS TIME THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM HIS AMIABLE WIFE CANTERBURY MONDAY EVENING YOU WILL DOUBTLESS BE SURPRISED MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD TO RECEIVE THIS COMMUNICATION STILL MORE SO BY ITS CONTENTS STILL MORE SO BY THE STIPULATION OF IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE WHICH I BEG TO IMPOSE BUT MY FEELINGS AS A WIFE AND MOTHER REQUIRE RELIEF AND AS I DO NOT WISH TO CONSULT MY FAMILY ALREADY OBNOXIOUS TO THE FEELINGS OF MR MICAWBER I KNOW NO ONE OF WHOM I CAN BETTER ASK ADVICE THAN MY FRIEND AND FORMER LODGER YOU MAY BE AWARE MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD THAT BETWEEN MYSELF AND MR MICAWBER WHOM I WILL NEVER DESERT THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN PRESERVED A SPIRIT OF MUTUAL CONFIDENCE MR MICAWBER MAY HAVE OCCASIONALLY GIVEN A BILL WITHOUT CONSULTING ME OR HE MAY HAVE MISLED ME AS TO THE PERIOD WHEN THAT OBLIGATION WOULD BECOME DUE THIS HAS ACTUALLY HAPPENED BUT IN GENERAL MR MICAWBER HAS HAD NO SECRETS FROM THE BOSOM OF AFFECTIONI ALLUDE TO HIS WIFEAND HAS INVARIABLY ON OUR RETIREMENT TO REST RECALLED THE EVENTS OF THE DAY YOU WILL PICTURE TO YOURSELF MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD WHAT THE POIGNANCY OF MY FEELINGS MUST BE WHEN I INFORM YOU THAT MR MICAWBER IS ENTIRELY CHANGED HE IS RESERVED HE IS SECRET HIS LIFE IS A MYSTERY TO THE PARTNER OF HIS JOYS AND SORROWSI AGAIN ALLUDE TO HIS WIFEAND IF I SHOULD ASSURE YOU THAT BEYOND KNOWING THAT IT IS PASSED FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AT THE OFFICE I NOW KNOW LESS OF IT THAN I DO OF THE MAN IN THE SOUTH CONNECTED WITH WHOSE MOUTH THE THOUGHTLESS CHILDREN REPEAT AN IDLE TALE RESPECTING COLD PLUM PORRIDGE I SHOULD ADOPT A POPULAR FALLACY TO EXPRESS AN ACTUAL FACT BUT THIS IS NOT ALL MR MICAWBER IS MOROSE HE IS SEVERE HE IS ESTRANGED FROM OUR ELDEST SON AND DAUGHTER HE HAS NO PRIDE IN HIS TWINS HE LOOKS WITH AN EYE OF COLDNESS EVEN ON THE UNOFFENDING STRANGER WHO LAST BECAME A MEMBER OF OUR CIRCLE THE PECUNIARY MEANS OF MEETING OUR EXPENSES KEPT DOWN TO THE UTMOST FARTHING ARE OBTAINED FROM HIM WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY AND EVEN UNDER FEARFUL THREATS THAT HE WILL SETTLE HIMSELF THE EXACT EXPRESSION AND HE INEXORABLY REFUSES TO GIVE ANY EXPLANATION WHATEVER OF THIS DISTRACTING POLICY THIS IS HARD TO BEAR THIS IS HEARTBREAKING IF YOU WILL ADVISE ME KNOWING MY FEEBLE POWERS SUCH AS THEY ARE HOW YOU THINK IT WILL BE BEST TO EXERT THEM IN A DILEMMA SO UNWONTED YOU WILL ADD ANOTHER FRIENDLY OBLIGATION TO THE MANY YOU HAVE ALREADY RENDERED ME WITH LOVES FROM THE CHILDREN AND A SMILE FROM THE HAPPILYUNCONSCIOUS STRANGER I REMAIN DEAR MR COPPERFIELD YOUR AFFLICTED EMMA MICAWBER I DID NOT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN GIVING A WIFE OF MRS MICAWBERS EXPERIENCE ANY OTHER RECOMMENDATION THAN THAT SHE SHOULD TRY TO RECLAIM MR MICAWBER BY PATIENCE AND KINDNESS AS I KNEW SHE WOULD IN ANY CASE BUT THE LETTER SET ME THINKING ABOUT HIM VERY MUCH CHAPTER ANOTHER RETROSPECT ONCE AGAIN LET ME PAUSE UPON A MEMORABLE PERIOD OF MY LIFE LET ME STAND ASIDE TO SEE THE PHANTOMS OF THOSE DAYS GO BY ME ACCOMPANYING THE SHADOW OF MYSELF IN DIM PROCESSION WEEKS MONTHS SEASONS PASS ALONG THEY SEEM LITTLE MORE THAN A SUMMER DAY AND A WINTER EVENING NOW THE COMMON WHERE I WALK WITH DORA IS ALL IN BLOOM A FIELD OF BRIGHT GOLD AND NOW THE UNSEEN HEATHER LIES IN MOUNDS AND BUNCHES UNDERNEATH A COVERING OF SNOW IN A BREATH THE RIVER THAT FLOWS THROUGH OUR SUNDAY WALKS IS SPARKLING IN THE SUMMER SUN IS RUFFLED BY THE WINTER WIND OR THICKENED WITH DRIFTING HEAPS OF ICE FASTER THAN EVER RIVER RAN TOWARDS THE SEA IT FLASHES DARKENS AND ROLLS

DEBATES IN PARLIAMENT FOR A MORNING NEWSPAPER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT I RECORD PREDICTIONS THAT NEVER COME TO PASS PROFESSIONS THAT ARE NEVER FULFILLED EXPLANATIONS THAT ARE ONLY MEANT TO MYSTIFY I WALLOW IN WORDS BRITANNIA THAT UNFORTUNATE FEMALE IS ALWAYS BEFORE ME LIKE A TRUSSED FOWL SKEWERED THROUGH AND THROUGH WITH OFFICEPENS AND BOUND HAND AND FOOT WITH RED TAPE I AM SUFFICIENTLY BEHIND THE SCENES TO KNOW THE WORTH OF POLITICAL LIFE I AM QUITE AN INFIDEL ABOUT IT AND SHALL NEVER BE CONVERTED MY DEAR OLD TRADDLES HAS TRIED HIS HAND AT THE SAME PURSUIT BUT IT IS NOT IN TRADDLESS WAY HE IS PERFECTLY GOODHUMOURED RESPECTING HIS FAILURE AND REMINDS ME THAT HE ALWAYS DID CONSIDER HIMSELF SLOW HE HAS OCCASIONAL EMPLOYMENT ON THE SAME NEWSPAPER IN GETTING UP THE FACTS OF DRY SUBJECTS TO BE WRITTEN ABOUT AND EMBELLISHED BY MORE FERTILE MINDS HE IS CALLED TO THE BAR AND WITH ADMIRABLE INDUSTRY AND SELFDENIAL HAS SCRAPED ANOTHER HUNDRED POUNDS TOGETHER TO FEE A CONVEYANCER WHOSE CHAMBERS HE ATTENDS A GREAT DEAL OF VERY HOT PORT WINE WAS CONSUMED AT HIS CALL AND CONSIDERING THE FIGURE I SHOULD THINK THE INNER TEMPLE MUST HAVE MADE A PROFIT BY IT I HAVE COME OUT IN ANOTHER WAY I HAVE TAKEN WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING TO AUTHORSHIP I WROTE A LITTLE SOMETHING IN SECRET AND SENT IT TO A MAGAZINE AND IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE MAGAZINE SINCE THEN I HAVE TAKEN HEART TO WRITE A GOOD MANY TRIFLING PIECES NOW I AM REGULARLY PAID FOR THEM ALTOGETHER I AM WELL OFF WHEN I TELL MY INCOME ON THE FINGERS OF MY LEFT HAND I PASS THE THIRD FINGER AND TAKE IN THE FOURTH TO THE MIDDLE JOINT WE

SEES A CHINESE HOUSE FOR JIP WITH LITTLE BELLS ON THE TOP AND PREFERS THAT AND IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO ACCUSTOM JIP TO HIS NEW RESIDENCE AFTER WE HAVE BOUGHT IT WHENEVER HE GOES IN OR OUT HE MAKES ALL

EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE RUBBED UNTIL IT SHINES LIKE HER OWN HONEST FOREHEAD WITH PERPETUAL FRICTION AND NOW IT IS THAT I BEGIN TO SEE HER SOLITARY BROTHER PASSING THROUGH THE DARK STREETS AT NIGHT AND LOOKING AS HE GOES AMONG THE WANDERING FACES I NEVER SPEAK TO HIM AT SUCH AN HOUR I KNOW TOO WELL AS HIS GRAVE FIGURE PASSES ONWARD WHAT HE SEEKS AND WHAT HE DREADS WHY DOES TRADDLES LOOK SO IMPORTANT

ON THE CARPETS LOOKING AS IF FRESHLY GATHERED AND THE GREEN LEAVES ON THE PAPER AS IF THEY HAD JUST COME OUT WITH THE SPOTLESS MUSLIN CURTAINS AND THE BLUSHING ROSECOLOURED FURNITURE AND DORAS GARDEN HAT WITH THE BLUE RIBBONDO I REMEMBER NOW HOW I LOVED HER IN SUCH ANOTHER HAT WHEN I FIRST KNEW HERALREADY HANGING ON ITS LITTLE PEG THE GUITARCASE QUITE AT HOME ON ITS HEELS IN A CORNER AND EVERYBODY TUMBLING OVER JIPS PAGODA WHICH IS MUCH TOO BIG FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT ANOTHER HAPPY EVENING QUITE AS UNREAL AS ALL THE REST OF IT AND I STEAL INTO THE USUAL ROOM BEFORE GOING AWAY DORA IS NOT THERE I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE NOT DONE TRYING ON YET MISS LAVINIA PEEPS IN AND TELLS ME MYSTERIOUSLY THAT SHE WILL NOT BE LONG SHE IS RATHER LONG NOTWITHSTANDING BUT BY AND BY I HEAR A RUSTLING AT THE DOOR AND SOMEONE TAPS I SAY COME IN BUT SOMEONE TAPS AGAIN I GO TO THE DOOR WONDERING WHO IT IS THERE I MEET A PAIR OF BRIGHT EYES AND A BLUSHING FACE THEY ARE DORAS EYES AND FACE AND MISS LAVINIA HAS DRESSED

SO PLEASED AND I BELIEVE IT LESS THAN EVER DO YOU THINK IT PRETTY DOADY SAYS DORA PRETTY I SHOULD RATHER THINK I DID AND ARE YOU SURE YOU LIKE ME VERY MUCH SAYS DORA THE TOPIC IS FRAUGHT WITH SUCH DANGER TO THE BONNET THAT MISS LAVINIA GIVES ANOTHER LITTLE SCREAM AND BEGS ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT DORA IS ONLY TO BE LOOKED AT AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO BE TOUCHED SO DORA STANDS IN A DELIGHTFUL STATE OF CONFUSION FOR A MINUTE OR TWO TO BE ADMIRED AND THEN TAKES OFF HER BONNETLOOKING SO NATURAL WITHOUT ITAND RUNS AWAY WITH IT IN HER HAND AND COMES DANCING DOWN AGAIN IN HER OWN FAMILIAR DRESS AND ASKS JIP IF I HAVE GOT A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE WIFE AND WHETHER HELL FORGIVE HER FOR BEING MARRIED AND KNEELS DOWN TO MAKE HIM STAND UPON THE COOKERYBOOK FOR THE LAST TIME IN HER SINGLE LIFE I GO HOME MORE INCREDULOUS THAN EVER TO A LODGING THAT I HAVE HARD BY AND GET UP VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING TO RIDE TO THE HIGHGATE ROAD AND FETCH MY AUNT I HAVE NEVER SEEN MY AUNT IN SUCH STATE SHE IS DRESSED IN

STILL AS WE DRIVE ALONG IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE THIS FAIRY MARRIAGE IS REAL ENOUGH TO FILL ME WITH A SORT OF WONDERING PITY FOR THE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO PART IN IT BUT ARE SWEEPING OUT THE SHOPS AND GOING TO THEIR DAILY OCCUPATIONS MY AUNT SITS WITH MY HAND IN HERS ALL THE WAY WHEN WE STOP A LITTLE WAY SHORT OF THE CHURCH TO PUT DOWN PEGGOTTY WHOM WE HAVE BROUGHT ON THE BOX SHE GIVES IT A

MIGHT BE A STEAMPOWER LOOM IN FULL ACTION FOR ANY SEDATIVE EFFECT IT HAS ON ME I AM TOO FAR GONE FOR THAT THE REST IS ALL A MORE OR LESS INCOHERENT DREAM A DREAM OF THEIR COMING IN WITH DORA OF THE PEWOPENER ARRANGING US LIKE A DRILLSERGEANT BEFORE THE ALTAR RAILS OF MY WONDERING EVEN THEN WHY PEWOPENERS MUST ALWAYS BE THE MOST DISAGREEABLE FEMALES PROCURABLE AND WHETHER THERE IS ANY RELIGIOUS DREAD OF A DISASTROUS INFECTION OF GOODHUMOUR WHICH RENDERS IT INDISPENSABLE TO SET THOSE VESSELS OF VINEGAR UPON THE ROAD TO HEAVEN OF THE CLERGYMAN AND CLERK APPEARING OF A FEW BOATMEN AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE STROLLING IN OF AN ANCIENT MARINER BEHIND ME STRONGLY FLAVOURING THE CHURCH WITH RUM OF THE SERVICE BEGINNING IN A DEEP VOICE AND OUR ALL BEING VERY ATTENTIVE OF MISS LAVINIA WHO ACTS AS

CARRIAGE GOING BACK OF SOPHY TELLING US THAT WHEN SHE SAW TRADDLES WHOM I HAD ENTRUSTED WITH THE LICENCE ASKED FOR IT SHE ALMOST FAINTED HAVING BEEN CONVINCED THAT HE WOULD CONTRIVE TO LOSE IT OR TO HAVE HIS POCKET PICKED OF AGNES LAUGHING GAILY AND OF DORA BEING SO FOND OF AGNES THAT SHE WILL NOT BE SEPARATED FROM HER BUT STILL KEEPS HER HAND OF THERE BEING A BREAKFAST WITH ABUNDANCE OF THINGS PRETTY AND SUBSTANTIAL TO EAT AND DRINK WHEREOF I PARTAKE AS I SHOULD DO IN ANY OTHER DREAM WITHOUT THE LEAST PERCEPTION OF THEIR FLAVOUR EATING AND DRINKING AS I MAY SAY NOTHING BUT LOVE AND MARRIAGE AND NO MORE BELIEVING IN THE VIANDS THAN IN ANYTHING ELSE OF MY MAKING A SPEECH IN THE SAME DREAMY FASHION WITHOUT HAVING AN IDEA OF WHAT I WANT TO SAY BEYOND SUCH AS MAY BE COMPREHENDED IN THE FULL CONVICTION THAT I HAVENT SAID IT OF OUR BEING VERY SOCIABLY AND SIMPLY HAPPY ALWAYS IN A DREAM THOUGH AND OF JIPS HAVING WEDDING CAKE AND ITS NOT AGREEING WITH HIM AFTERWARDS OF THE PAIR OF HIRED POSTHORSES BEING READY AND OF DORAS GOING AWAY TO CHANGE HER DRESS OF MY AUNT AND MISS CLARISSA REMAINING WITH US AND OUR WALKING IN THE GARDEN AND MY AUNT WHO HAS MADE QUITE A SPEECH AT BREAKFAST TOUCHING DORAS AUNTS BEING MIGHTILY AMUSED WITH HERSELF BUT A LITTLE PROUD OF IT TOO OF DORAS BEING READY AND OF MISS LAVINIAS HOVERING ABOUT HER LOTH TO LOSE THE PRETTY TOY THAT HAS GIVEN HER SO MUCH PLEASANT OCCUPATION OF DORAS MAKING A LONG SERIES OF SURPRISED DISCOVERIES THAT SHE HAS FORGOTTEN ALL SORTS OF LITTLE THINGS AND OF EVERYBODYS RUNNING EVERYWHERE TO FETCH THEM OF THEIR ALL CLOSING ABOUT DORA WHEN AT LAST SHE BEGINS TO SAY GOODBYE LOOKING WITH THEIR BRIGHT COLOURS AND RIBBONS LIKE A BED OF FLOWERS OF MY DARLING BEING ALMOST SMOTHERED AMONG THE FLOWERS AND COMING OUT LAUGHING AND CRYING BOTH TOGETHER TO MY JEALOUS ARMS OF MY WANTING TO CARRY JIP WHO IS TO GO ALONG WITH US AND DORAS SAYING NO THAT SHE MUST CARRY HIM OR ELSE HELL THINK SHE DONT LIKE HIM ANY MORE NOW SHE IS

STOOD ASIDE TO SEE THE PHANTOMS OF THOSE DAYS GO BY ME THEY ARE GONE AND I RESUME THE JOURNEY OF MY STORY CHAPTER OUR HOUSEKEEPING IT WAS A STRANGE CONDITION OF THINGS THE HONEYMOON BEING OVER AND THE BRIDESMAIDS GONE HOME WHEN I FOUND MYSELF SITTING DOWN IN MY OWN SMALL HOUSE WITH DORA QUITE THROWN OUT OF EMPLOYMENT AS I MAY SAY IN RESPECT OF THE DELICIOUS OLD OCCUPATION OF MAKING LOVE IT SEEMED SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY THING TO HAVE DORA ALWAYS THERE IT WAS SO UNACCOUNTABLE NOT TO BE OBLIGED TO GO OUT TO SEE HER NOT TO HAVE ANY OCCASION TO BE TORMENTING MYSELF ABOUT HER NOT TO HAVE TO WRITE TO HER NOT TO BE SCHEMING AND DEVISING OPPORTUNITIES OF BEING ALONE WITH HER SOMETIMES OF AN EVENING WHEN I LOOKED UP FROM MY WRITING AND SAW HER SEATED OPPOSITE I WOULD LEAN BACK IN MY CHAIR AND THINK HOW QUEER IT WAS THAT THERE WE WERE ALONE TOGETHER AS A MATTER OF COURSENOBODYS BUSINESS ANY MOREALL THE ROMANCE OF OUR ENGAGEMENT PUT AWAY UPON A SHELF TO RUSTNO ONE TO PLEASE BUT ONE ANOTHERONE ANOTHER TO PLEASE FOR LIFE WHEN THERE WAS A DEBATE AND I WAS KEPT OUT VERY LATE IT SEEMED SO STRANGE TO ME AS I WAS WALKING HOME TO THINK THAT DORA WAS AT HOME IT WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL THING AT FIRST TO HAVE HER COMING SOFTLY DOWN TO TALK TO ME AS I ATE MY SUPPER IT WAS SUCH A STUPENDOUS THING TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT SHE PUT HER HAIR IN PAPERS IT WAS ALTOGETHER SUCH AN ASTONISHING EVENT TO SEE HER DO IT I DOUBT WHETHER TWO YOUNG BIRDS COULD HAVE KNOWN LESS ABOUT KEEPING HOUSE THAN I AND MY PRETTY DORA DID WE HAD A SERVANT OF COURSE SHE KEPT HOUSE FOR US I HAVE STILL A LATENT BELIEF THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN MRS CRUPPS DAUGHTER IN DISGUISE WE HAD SUCH AN AWFUL TIME OF IT WITH MARY ANNE HER NAME WAS PARAGON HER NATURE WAS REPRESENTED TO US WHEN WE ENGAGED HER AS BEING FEEBLY EXPRESSED IN HER NAME SHE HAD A WRITTEN CHARACTER AS LARGE AS A PROCLAMATION AND ACCORDING TO THIS DOCUMENT COULD DO EVERYTHING OF A DOMESTIC NATURE THAT EVER I HEARD OF AND A GREAT MANY THINGS THAT I NEVER DID HEAR OF SHE WAS A WOMAN IN THE PRIME OF LIFE OF A SEVERE COUNTENANCE AND SUBJECT PARTICULARLY IN THE ARMS TO A SORT OF PERPETUAL MEASLES OR FIERY RASH SHE HAD A COUSIN IN THE LIFEGUARDS WITH SUCH LONG LEGS THAT HE LOOKED LIKE THE AFTERNOON SHADOW OF SOMEBODY ELSE HIS SHELLJACKET WAS AS MUCH TOO LITTLE FOR HIM AS HE WAS TOO BIG FOR THE PREMISES HE MADE THE COTTAGE SMALLER THAN IT NEED HAVE BEEN BY BEING SO VERY MUCH OUT OF PROPORTION TO IT BESIDES WHICH THE WALLS WERE NOT THICK AND WHENEVER HE PASSED THE EVENING AT OUR HOUSE WE ALWAYS KNEW OF IT BY HEARING ONE CONTINUAL GROWL IN THE KITCHEN OUR TREASURE WAS WARRANTED SOBER AND HONEST I AM THEREFORE WILLING TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS IN A FIT WHEN WE FOUND HER UNDER THE BOILER AND THAT THE DEFICIENT TEASPOONS WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DUSTMAN BUT SHE PREYED UPON OUR MINDS DREADFULLY WE FELT OUR INEXPERIENCE AND WERE UNABLE TO HELP OURSELVES WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT HER MERCY IF SHE HAD HAD ANY BUT SHE WAS A REMORSELESS WOMAN AND HAD NONE SHE WAS THE CAUSE OF OUR FIRST LITTLE QUARREL MY DEAREST LIFE I SAID ONE DAY TO DORA DO YOU THINK MARY ANNE HAS ANY IDEA OF TIME WHY DOADY INQUIRED DORA LOOKING UP INNOCENTLY FROM HER DRAWING MY LOVE BECAUSE

YOU HAVE DONE ME GOOD MY DEAR AND DIVISION MUST NOT COME BETWEEN US AT THIS TIME OF DAY DIVISION BETWEEN US CRIED I CHILD CHILD SAID MY AUNT SMOOTHING HER DRESS HOW SOON IT MIGHT COME BETWEEN US OR HOW UNHAPPY I MIGHT MAKE OUR LITTLE BLOSSOM IF I MEDDLED IN ANYTHING A PROPHET COULDNT SAY I WANT OUR PET TO LIKE ME AND BE AS GAY AS A BUTTERFLY REMEMBER YOUR OWN HOME IN THAT SECOND MARRIAGE AND NEVER DO BOTH ME AND HER THE INJURY YOU HAVE HINTED AT I COMPREHENDED AT ONCE THAT MY AUNT WAS RIGHT AND I COMPREHENDED THE FULL EXTENT OF HER GENEROUS FEELING TOWARDS MY DEAR WIFE THESE ARE EARLY DAYS TROT SHE PURSUED AND ROME WAS NOT BUILT IN A DAY NOR IN A YEAR YOU HAVE CHOSEN FREELY FOR YOURSELF A CLOUD PASSED OVER HER FACE FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT AND YOU HAVE CHOSEN A VERY PRETTY AND A VERY AFFECTIONATE CREATURE IT WILL BE YOUR DUTY AND IT WILL BE YOUR PLEASURE TOOOF COURSE I KNOW THAT I AM NOT DELIVERING A LECTURETO ESTIMATE HER AS YOU CHOSE HER BY THE QUALITIES SHE HAS AND NOT BY THE QUALITIES SHE MAY NOT HAVE THE LATTER YOU MUST DEVELOP IN HER IF YOU CAN AND IF YOU CANNOT CHILD HERE MY AUNT RUBBED HER NOSE YOU MUST JUST ACCUSTOM YOURSELF TO DO WITHOUT EM BUT REMEMBER MY DEAR YOUR FUTURE IS BETWEEN YOU TWO NO ONE CAN ASSIST YOU YOU ARE TO WORK IT OUT FOR YOURSELVES THIS IS MARRIAGE TROT AND HEAVEN BLESS YOU BOTH IN IT FOR A PAIR OF BABES IN THE WOOD AS YOU ARE MY AUNT SAID THIS IN A SPRIGHTLY WAY AND GAVE ME A KISS TO RATIFY THE BLESSING NOW SAID SHE LIGHT MY LITTLE LANTERN AND SEE ME INTO MY BANDBOX BY THE GARDEN PATH FOR THERE WAS A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR COTTAGES IN THAT DIRECTION GIVE BETSEY TROTWOODS LOVE TO BLOSSOM WHEN YOU COME BACK AND WHATEVER YOU DO TROT NEVER DREAM OF SETTING BETSEY UP AS A SCARECROW FOR IF I EVER SAW HER IN THE GLASS SHES QUITE GRIM ENOUGH AND GAUNT ENOUGH IN HER PRIVATE CAPACITY WITH THIS MY AUNT TIED HER HEAD UP IN A HANDKERCHIEF WITH WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO MAKE A BUNDLE OF IT ON SUCH OCCASIONS AND I ESCORTED HER HOME AS SHE STOOD IN HER GARDEN HOLDING UP HER LITTLE LANTERN TO LIGHT ME BACK I THOUGHT HER OBSERVATION OF ME HAD AN ANXIOUS AIR AGAIN BUT I WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN PONDERING ON WHAT SHE HAD SAID AND TOO MUCH IMPRESSEDFOR THE FIRST TIME IN REALITYBY THE CONVICTION THAT DORA AND I HAD INDEED TO WORK OUT OUR FUTURE FOR OURSELVES AND THAT NO ONE COULD ASSIST US TO TAKE MUCH NOTICE OF IT DORA CAME STEALING DOWN IN HER LITTLE SLIPPERS TO MEET ME NOW THAT I WAS ALONE AND CRIED UPON MY SHOULDER AND SAID I HAD BEEN HARDHEARTED AND SHE HAD BEEN NAUGHTY AND I SAID MUCH THE SAME THING IN EFFECT I BELIEVE AND WE MADE IT UP AND AGREED THAT OUR FIRST LITTLE DIFFERENCE WAS TO BE OUR LAST AND THAT WE WERE NEVER TO HAVE ANOTHER IF WE LIVED A HUNDRED YEARS THE NEXT DOMESTIC TRIAL WE WENT THROUGH WAS THE ORDEAL OF SERVANTS MARY ANNES COUSIN DESERTED INTO OUR COALHOLE AND WAS BROUGHT OUT TO OUR GREAT AMAZEMENT BY A PIQUET OF HIS COMPANIONS IN ARMS WHO TOOK HIM AWAY HANDCUFFED IN A PROCESSION THAT COVERED OUR FRONTGARDEN WITH IGNOMINY THIS NERVED ME TO GET RID OF MARY ANNE WHO WENT SO MILDLY ON RECEIPT OF WAGES THAT I WAS SURPRISED UNTIL I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE TEASPOONS AND ALSO ABOUT THE LITTLE SUMS SHE HAD BORROWED IN MY NAME OF THE TRADESPEOPLE WITHOUT AUTHORITY AFTER AN INTERVAL OF MRS KIDGERBURYTHE OLDEST INHABITANT OF KENTISH TOWN I BELIEVE WHO WENT OUT CHARING BUT WAS TOO FEEBLE TO EXECUTE HER CONCEPTIONS OF THAT ARTWE FOUND ANOTHER TREASURE WHO WAS ONE OF THE MOST AMIABLE OF WOMEN BUT WHO GENERALLY MADE A POINT OF FALLING EITHER UP OR DOWN THE KITCHEN STAIRS WITH THE TRAY AND ALMOST PLUNGED INTO THE PARLOUR AS INTO A BATH WITH THE TEATHINGS THE RAVAGES COMMITTED BY THIS UNFORTUNATE RENDERING HER DISMISSAL NECESSARY SHE WAS SUCCEEDED WITH INTERVALS OF MRS KIDGERBURY BY A LONG LINE OF INCAPABLES TERMINATING IN A YOUNG PERSON OF GENTEEL APPEARANCE WHO WENT TO GREENWICH FAIR IN DORAS BONNET AFTER WHOM I REMEMBER NOTHING BUT AN AVERAGE EQUALITY OF FAILURE EVERYBODY WE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH SEEMED TO CHEAT US OUR APPEARANCE IN A SHOP WAS A SIGNAL FOR THE DAMAGED GOODS TO BE BROUGHT OUT IMMEDIATELY IF WE BOUGHT A LOBSTER IT WAS FULL OF WATER ALL OUR MEAT TURNED OUT TO BE TOUGH AND THERE WAS HARDLY ANY CRUST TO OUR LOAVES IN SEARCH OF THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH JOINTS OUGHT TO BE ROASTED TO BE ROASTED ENOUGH AND NOT TOO MUCH I MYSELF REFERRED TO THE COOKERY BOOK AND FOUND IT THERE ESTABLISHED AS THE ALLOWANCE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO EVERY POUND AND SAY A QUARTER OVER BUT THE PRINCIPLE ALWAYS FAILED US BY SOME CURIOUS FATALITY AND WE NEVER COULD HIT ANY MEDIUM BETWEEN REDNESS AND CINDERS I HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IN ACCOMPLISHING THESE FAILURES WE INCURRED A FAR GREATER EXPENSE THAN IF WE HAD ACHIEVED A SERIES OF TRIUMPHS IT APPEARED TO ME ON LOOKING OVER THE TRADESMENS BOOKS AS IF WE MIGHT HAVE KEPT THE BASEMENT STOREY PAVED WITH BUTTER SUCH WAS THE EXTENSIVE SCALE OF OUR CONSUMPTION OF THAT ARTICLE I DONT KNOW WHETHER THE EXCISE RETURNS OF THE PERIOD MAY HAVE EXHIBITED ANY INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR PEPPER BUT IF OUR PERFORMANCES DID NOT AFFECT THE MARKET I SHOULD SAY SEVERAL FAMILIES MUST HAVE LEFT OFF USING IT AND THE MOST WONDERFUL FACT OF ALL WAS THAT WE NEVER HAD ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE AS TO THE WASHERWOMAN PAWNING THE CLOTHES AND COMING IN A STATE OF PENITENT INTOXICATION TO APOLOGIZE I SUPPOSE THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES TO ANYBODY ALSO THE CHIMNEY ON FIRE THE PARISH ENGINE AND PERJURY ON THE PART OF THE BEADLE BUT I APPREHEND THAT WE WERE PERSONALLY FORTUNATE IN ENGAGING A SERVANT WITH A TASTE FOR CORDIALS WHO SWELLED OUR RUNNING ACCOUNT FOR PORTER AT THE PUBLICHOUSE BY SUCH INEXPLICABLE ITEMS AS QUARTERN RUM SHRUB MRS C HALFQUARTERN GIN AND CLOVES MRS C GLASS RUM AND PEPPERMINT MRS CTHE PARENTHESES ALWAYS REFERRING TO DORA WHO WAS SUPPOSED IT APPEARED ON EXPLANATION TO HAVE IMBIBED THE WHOLE OF THESE REFRESHMENTS ONE OF OUR FIRST FEATS IN THE HOUSEKEEPING WAY WAS A LITTLE DINNER TO TRADDLES I MET HIM IN TOWN AND ASKED HIM TO WALK OUT WITH ME THAT AFTERNOON HE READILY CONSENTING I WROTE TO DORA SAYING I WOULD BRING HIM HOME IT WAS PLEASANT WEATHER AND ON THE ROAD WE MADE MY DOMESTIC HAPPINESS THE THEME OF CONVERSATION TRADDLES WAS VERY FULL OF IT AND SAID THAT PICTURING HIMSELF WITH SUCH A HOME AND SOPHY WAITING AND PREPARING FOR HIM HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING WANTING TO COMPLETE HIS BLISS I COULD NOT HAVE WISHED FOR A PRETTIER LITTLE WIFE AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TABLE BUT I CERTAINLY COULD HAVE WISHED WHEN WE SAT DOWN FOR A LITTLE MORE ROOM I DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS BUT THOUGH THERE WERE ONLY TWO OF US WE WERE AT ONCE ALWAYS CRAMPED FOR ROOM AND YET HAD ALWAYS ROOM ENOUGH TO LOSE EVERYTHING IN I SUSPECT IT MAY HAVE BEEN BECAUSE NOTHING HAD A PLACE OF ITS OWN EXCEPT JIPS PAGODA WHICH INVARIABLY BLOCKED UP THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE ON THE PRESENT OCCASION TRADDLES WAS SO HEMMED IN BY THE PAGODA AND THE GUITARCASE AND DORAS FLOWERPAINTING AND MY WRITINGTABLE THAT I HAD SERIOUS DOUBTS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS USING HIS KNIFE AND FORK BUT HE PROTESTED WITH HIS OWN GOODHUMOUR OCEANS OF ROOM COPPERFIELD I ASSURE YOU OCEANS THERE WAS ANOTHER THING I COULD HAVE WISHED NAMELY THAT JIP HAD NEVER BEEN ENCOURAGED TO WALK ABOUT THE TABLECLOTH DURING DINNER I BEGAN TO THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING DISORDERLY IN HIS BEING THERE AT ALL EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN IN THE HABIT OF PUTTING HIS FOOT IN THE SALT OR THE MELTED BUTTER ON THIS OCCASION HE SEEMED TO THINK HE WAS INTRODUCED EXPRESSLY TO KEEP TRADDLES AT BAY AND HE BARKED AT MY OLD FRIEND AND MADE SHORT RUNS AT HIS PLATE WITH SUCH UNDAUNTED PERTINACITY THAT HE MAY BE SAID TO HAVE ENGROSSED THE CONVERSATION HOWEVER AS I KNEW HOW TENDERHEARTED MY DEAR DORA WAS AND HOW SENSITIVE SHE WOULD BE TO ANY SLIGHT UPON HER FAVOURITE I HINTED NO OBJECTION FOR SIMILAR REASONS I MADE NO ALLUSION TO THE SKIRMISHING PLATES UPON THE FLOOR OR TO THE DISREPUTABLE APPEARANCE OF THE CASTORS WHICH WERE ALL AT SIXES AND SEVENS AND LOOKED DRUNK OR TO THE FURTHER BLOCKADE OF TRADDLES BY WANDERING VEGETABLE DISHES AND JUGS I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING IN MY OWN MIND AS I CONTEMPLATED THE BOILED LEG OF MUTTON BEFORE ME PREVIOUS TO CARVING IT HOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT OUR JOINTS OF MEAT WERE OF SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SHAPESAND WHETHER OUR BUTCHER CONTRACTED FOR ALL THE DEFORMED SHEEP THAT CAME INTO THE WORLD BUT I KEPT MY REFLECTIONS TO MYSELF MY LOVE SAID I TO DORA WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN THAT DISH I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHY DORA HAD BEEN MAKING TEMPTING LITTLE FACES AT ME AS IF SHE WANTED TO KISS ME OYSTERS DEAR SAID DORA TIMIDLY WAS THAT YOUR THOUGHT SAID I DELIGHTED YEYES DOADY SAID DORA THERE NEVER WAS A HAPPIER ONE I EXCLAIMED LAYING DOWN THE CARVINGKNIFE AND FORK THERE IS NOTHING TRADDLES LIKES SO MUCH YEYES DOADY SAID DORA AND SO I BOUGHT A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BARREL OF THEM AND THE MAN SAID THEY WERE VERY GOOD BUT II AM AFRAID THERES SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH THEM THEY DONT SEEM RIGHT HERE DORA SHOOK HER HEAD AND DIAMONDS TWINKLED IN HER EYES THEY ARE ONLY OPENED IN BOTH SHELLS SAID I TAKE THE TOP ONE OFF MY LOVE BUT IT WONT COME OFF SAID DORA TRYING VERY HARD AND LOOKING VERY MUCH DISTRESSED DO YOU KNOW COPPERFIELD SAID TRADDLES CHEERFULLY EXAMINING THE DISH I THINK IT IS IN CONSEQUENCETHEY ARE CAPITAL OYSTERS BUT I THINK IT IS IN CONSEQUENCEOF THEIR NEVER HAVING BEEN OPENED THEY NEVER HAD BEEN OPENED AND WE HAD NO OYSTERKNIVESAND COULDNT HAVE USED THEM IF WE HAD SO WE LOOKED AT THE OYSTERS AND ATE THE MUTTON AT LEAST WE ATE AS MUCH OF IT AS WAS DONE AND MADE UP WITH CAPERS IF I HAD PERMITTED HIM I AM SATISFIED THAT TRADDLES WOULD HAVE MADE A PERFECT SAVAGE OF HIMSELF AND EATEN A PLATEFUL OF RAW MEAT TO EXPRESS ENJOYMENT OF THE REPAST BUT I WOULD HEAR OF NO SUCH IMMOLATION ON THE ALTAR OF FRIENDSHIP AND WE HAD A COURSE OF BACON INSTEAD THERE HAPPENING BY GOOD FORTUNE TO BE COLD BACON IN THE LARDER MY POOR LITTLE WIFE WAS IN SUCH AFFLICTION WHEN SHE THOUGHT I SHOULD BE ANNOYED AND IN SUCH A STATE OF JOY WHEN SHE FOUND I WAS NOT THAT THE DISCOMFITURE I HAD SUBDUED VERY SOON VANISHED AND WE PASSED A HAPPY EVENING DORA SITTING WITH HER ARM ON MY CHAIR WHILE TRADDLES AND I DISCUSSED A GLASS OF WINE AND TAKING EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF WHISPERING IN MY EAR THAT IT WAS SO GOOD OF ME NOT TO BE A CRUEL CROSS OLD BOY BY AND BY SHE MADE TEA FOR US WHICH IT WAS SO PRETTY TO SEE HER DO AS IF SHE WAS BUSYING HERSELF WITH A SET OF DOLLS TEATHINGS THAT I WAS NOT PARTICULAR ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE BEVERAGE THEN TRADDLES AND I PLAYED A GAME OR TWO AT CRIBBAGE AND DORA SINGING TO THE GUITAR THE WHILE IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF OUR COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE WERE A TENDER DREAM OF MINE AND THE NIGHT WHEN I FIRST LISTENED TO HER VOICE WERE NOT YET OVER WHEN TRADDLES WENT AWAY AND I CAME BACK INTO THE PARLOUR FROM SEEING HIM OUT MY WIFE PLANTED HER CHAIR CLOSE TO MINE AND SAT DOWN BY MY SIDE I AM VERY SORRY SHE SAID WILL YOU TRY TO TEACH ME DOADY I MUST TEACH MYSELF FIRST DORA SAID I I AM AS BAD AS YOU LOVE AH BUT YOU CAN LEARN SHE RETURNED AND YOU ARE A CLEVER CLEVER MAN NONSENSE MOUSE SAID I I WISH RESUMED MY WIFE AFTER A LONG SILENCE THAT I COULD HAVE GONE DOWN INTO THE COUNTRY FOR A WHOLE YEAR AND LIVED WITH AGNES HER HANDS WERE CLASPED UPON MY SHOULDER AND HER CHIN RESTED ON THEM AND HER BLUE EYES LOOKED QUIETLY INTO MINE WHY SO I ASKED I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE IMPROVED ME AND I THINK I MIGHT HAVE LEARNED FROM HER SAID DORA ALL IN GOOD TIME MY LOVE AGNES HAS HAD HER FATHER TO TAKE CARE OF FOR THESE MANY YEARS YOU SHOULD REMEMBER EVEN WHEN SHE WAS QUITE A CHILD SHE WAS THE AGNES WHOM WE KNOW SAID I WILL YOU CALL ME A NAME I WANT YOU TO CALL ME INQUIRED DORA WITHOUT MOVING WHAT IS IT I ASKED WITH A SMILE ITS A STUPID NAME SHE SAID SHAKING HER CURLS FOR A MOMENT CHILDWIFE I LAUGHINGLY ASKED MY CHILDWIFE WHAT HER FANCY WAS IN DESIRING TO BE SO CALLED SHE ANSWERED WITHOUT MOVING OTHERWISE THAN AS THE ARM I TWINED ABOUT HER MAY HAVE BROUGHT HER BLUE EYES NEARER TO ME I DONT MEAN YOU SILLY FELLOW THAT YOU SHOULD USE THE NAME INSTEAD OF DORA I ONLY MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD THINK OF ME THAT WAY WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO BE ANGRY WITH ME SAY TO YOURSELF ITS ONLY MY CHILDWIFE WHEN I AM VERY DISAPPOINTING SAY I KNEW A LONG TIME AGO THAT SHE WOULD MAKE BUT A CHILDWIFE WHEN YOU MISS WHAT I SHOULD LIKE TO BE AND I THINK CAN NEVER BE SAY STILL MY FOOLISH CHILDWIFE LOVES ME FOR INDEED I DO I HAD NOT BEEN SERIOUS WITH HER HAVING NO IDEA UNTIL NOW THAT SHE WAS SERIOUS HERSELF BUT HER AFFECTIONATE NATURE WAS SO HAPPY IN WHAT I NOW SAID TO HER WITH MY WHOLE HEART THAT HER FACE BECAME A LAUGHING ONE BEFORE HER GLITTERING EYES WERE DRY SHE WAS SOON MY CHILDWIFE INDEED SITTING DOWN ON THE FLOOR OUTSIDE THE CHINESE HOUSE RINGING ALL THE LITTLE BELLS ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO PUNISH JIP FOR HIS RECENT BAD BEHAVIOUR WHILE JIP LAY BLINKING IN THE DOORWAY WITH HIS HEAD OUT EVEN TOO LAZY TO BE TEASED THIS APPEAL OF DORAS MADE A STRONG IMPRESSION ON ME I LOOK BACK ON THE TIME I WRITE OF I INVOKE THE INNOCENT FIGURE THAT I DEARLY LOVED TO COME OUT FROM THE MISTS AND SHADOWS OF THE PAST AND TURN ITS GENTLE HEAD TOWARDS ME ONCE AGAIN AND I CAN STILL DECLARE THAT THIS ONE LITTLE SPEECH WAS CONSTANTLY IN MY MEMORY I MAY NOT HAVE USED IT TO THE BEST ACCOUNT I WAS YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED BUT I NEVER TURNED A DEAF EAR TO ITS ARTLESS PLEADING DORA TOLD ME SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE A WONDERFUL HOUSEKEEPER ACCORDINGLY SHE POLISHED THE TABLETS POINTED THE PENCIL BOUGHT AN IMMENSE ACCOUNTBOOK CAREFULLY STITCHED UP WITH A NEEDLE AND THREAD ALL THE LEAVES OF THE COOKERY BOOK WHICH JIP HAD TORN AND MADE QUITE A DESPERATE LITTLE ATTEMPT TO BE GOOD AS SHE CALLED IT BUT THE FIGURES HAD THE OLD OBSTINATE PROPENSITYTHEY WOULD NOT ADD UP WHEN SHE HAD ENTERED TWO OR THREE LABORIOUS ITEMS IN THE ACCOUNTBOOK JIP WOULD WALK OVER THE PAGE WAGGING HIS TAIL AND SMEAR THEM ALL OUT HER OWN LITTLE RIGHTHAND MIDDLE FINGER GOT STEEPED TO THE VERY BONE IN INK AND I THINK THAT WAS THE ONLY DECIDED RESULT OBTAINED SOMETIMES OF AN EVENING WHEN I WAS AT HOME AND AT WORKFOR I WROTE A GOOD DEAL NOW AND WAS BEGINNING IN A SMALL WAY TO BE KNOWN AS A WRITERI WOULD LAY DOWN MY PEN AND WATCH MY CHILDWIFE TRYING TO BE GOOD FIRST OF ALL SHE WOULD BRING OUT THE IMMENSE ACCOUNTBOOK AND LAY IT DOWN UPON THE TABLE WITH A DEEP SIGH THEN SHE WOULD OPEN IT AT THE PLACE WHERE JIP HAD MADE IT ILLEGIBLE LAST NIGHT AND CALL JIP UP TO LOOK AT HIS MISDEEDS THIS WOULD OCCASION A DIVERSION IN JIPS FAVOUR AND SOME INKING OF HIS NOSE PERHAPS AS A PENALTY THEN SHE WOULD TELL JIP TO LIE DOWN ON THE TABLE INSTANTLY LIKE A LIONWHICH WAS ONE OF HIS TRICKS THOUGH I CANNOT SAY THE LIKENESS WAS STRIKINGAND IF HE WERE IN AN OBEDIENT HUMOUR HE WOULD OBEY THEN SHE WOULD TAKE UP A PEN AND BEGIN TO WRITE AND FIND A HAIR IN IT THEN SHE WOULD TAKE UP ANOTHER PEN AND BEGIN TO WRITE AND FIND THAT IT SPLUTTERED THEN SHE WOULD TAKE UP ANOTHER PEN AND BEGIN TO WRITE AND SAY IN A LOW VOICE OH ITS A TALKING PEN AND WILL DISTURB DOADY AND THEN SHE WOULD GIVE IT UP AS A BAD JOB AND PUT THE ACCOUNTBOOK AWAY AFTER PRETENDING TO CRUSH THE LION WITH IT OR IF SHE WERE IN A VERY SEDATE AND SERIOUS STATE OF MIND SHE WOULD SIT DOWN WITH THE TABLETS AND A LITTLE BASKET OF BILLS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS WHICH LOOKED MORE LIKE CURLPAPERS THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND ENDEAVOUR TO GET SOME RESULT OUT OF THEM AFTER SEVERELY COMPARING ONE WITH ANOTHER AND MAKING ENTRIES ON THE TABLETS AND BLOTTING THEM OUT AND COUNTING ALL THE FINGERS OF HER LEFT HAND OVER AND OVER AGAIN BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS SHE WOULD BE SO VEXED AND DISCOURAGED AND WOULD LOOK SO UNHAPPY THAT IT GAVE ME PAIN TO SEE HER BRIGHT FACE CLOUDEDAND FOR MEAND I WOULD GO SOFTLY TO HER AND SAY WHATS THE MATTER DORA DORA WOULD LOOK UP HOPELESSLY AND REPLY THEY WONT COME RIGHT THEY MAKE MY HEAD ACHE SO AND THEY WONT DO ANYTHING I WANT THEN I WOULD SAY NOW LET US TRY TOGETHER LET ME SHOW YOU DORA THEN I WOULD COMMENCE A PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION TO WHICH DORA WOULD PAY PROFOUND ATTENTION PERHAPS FOR FIVE MINUTES WHEN SHE WOULD BEGIN TO BE DREADFULLY TIRED AND WOULD LIGHTEN THE SUBJECT BY CURLING MY HAIR OR TRYING THE EFFECT OF MY FACE WITH MY SHIRTCOLLAR TURNED DOWN IF I TACITLY CHECKED THIS PLAYFULNESS AND PERSISTED SHE WOULD LOOK SO SCARED AND DISCONSOLATE AS SHE BECAME MORE AND MORE BEWILDERED THAT THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER NATURAL GAIETY WHEN I FIRST STRAYED INTO HER PATH AND OF HER BEING MY CHILDWIFE WOULD COME REPROACHFULLY UPON ME AND I WOULD LAY THE PENCIL DOWN AND CALL FOR THE GUITAR I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO DO AND HAD MANY ANXIETIES BUT THE SAME CONSIDERATIONS MADE ME KEEP THEM TO MYSELF I AM FAR FROM SURE NOW THAT IT WAS RIGHT TO DO THIS BUT I DID IT FOR MY CHILDWIFES SAKE I SEARCH MY BREAST AND I COMMIT ITS SECRETS IF I KNOW THEM WITHOUT ANY RESERVATION TO THIS PAPER THE OLD UNHAPPY LOSS OR WANT OF SOMETHING HAD I AM CONSCIOUS SOME PLACE IN MY HEART BUT NOT TO THE EMBITTERMENT OF MY LIFE WHEN I WALKED ALONE IN THE FINE WEATHER AND THOUGHT OF THE SUMMER DAYS WHEN ALL THE AIR HAD BEEN FILLED WITH MY BOYISH ENCHANTMENT I DID MISS SOMETHING OF THE REALIZATION OF MY DREAMS BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A SOFTENED GLORY OF THE PAST WHICH NOTHING COULD HAVE THROWN UPON THE PRESENT TIME I DID FEEL SOMETIMES FOR A LITTLE WHILE THAT I COULD HAVE WISHED MY WIFE HAD BEEN MY COUNSELLOR HAD HAD MORE CHARACTER AND PURPOSE TO SUSTAIN ME AND IMPROVE ME BY HAD BEEN ENDOWED WITH POWER TO FILL UP THE VOID WHICH SOMEWHERE SEEMED TO BE ABOUT ME BUT I FELT AS IF THIS WERE AN UNEARTHLY CONSUMMATION OF MY HAPPINESS THAT NEVER HAD BEEN MEANT TO BE AND NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN I WAS A BOYISH HUSBAND AS TO YEARS I HAD KNOWN THE SOFTENING INFLUENCE OF NO OTHER SORROWS OR EXPERIENCES THAN THOSE RECORDED IN THESE LEAVES IF I DID ANY WRONG AS I MAY HAVE DONE MUCH I DID IT IN MISTAKEN LOVE AND IN MY WANT OF WISDOM I WRITE THE EXACT TRUTH IT WOULD AVAIL ME NOTHING TO EXTENUATE IT NOW THUS IT WAS THAT I TOOK UPON MYSELF THE TOILS AND CARES OF OUR LIFE AND HAD NO PARTNER IN THEM WE LIVED MUCH AS BEFORE IN REFERENCE TO OUR SCRAMBLING HOUSEHOLD ARRANGEMENTS BUT I HAD GOT USED TO THOSE AND DORA I WAS PLEASED TO SEE WAS SELDOM VEXED NOW SHE WAS BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL IN THE OLD CHILDISH WAY LOVED ME DEARLY AND WAS HAPPY WITH HER OLD TRIFLES WHEN THE DEBATES WERE HEAVYI MEAN AS TO LENGTH NOT QUALITY FOR IN THE LAST RESPECT THEY WERE NOT OFTEN OTHERWISEAND I WENT HOME LATE DORA WOULD NEVER REST WHEN SHE HEARD MY FOOTSTEPS BUT WOULD ALWAYS COME DOWNSTAIRS TO MEET ME WHEN MY EVENINGS WERE UNOCCUPIED BY THE PURSUIT FOR WHICH I HAD QUALIFIED MYSELF WITH SO MUCH PAINS AND I WAS ENGAGED IN WRITING AT HOME SHE WOULD SIT QUIETLY NEAR ME HOWEVER LATE THE HOUR AND BE SO MUTE THAT I WOULD OFTEN THINK SHE HAD DROPPED ASLEEP BUT GENERALLY WHEN I RAISED MY HEAD I SAW HER BLUE EYES LOOKING AT ME WITH THE QUIET ATTENTION OF WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OH WHAT A WEARY BOY SAID DORA ONE NIGHT WHEN I MET HER EYES AS I WAS SHUTTING UP MY DESK WHAT A WEARY GIRL SAID I THATS MORE TO THE PURPOSE YOU MUST GO TO BED ANOTHER TIME MY LOVE ITS FAR TOO LATE FOR YOU NO DONT SEND ME TO BED PLEADED DORA COMING TO MY SIDE PRAY DONT DO THAT DORA TO MY AMAZEMENT SHE WAS SOBBING ON MY NECK NOT WELL MY DEAR NOT HAPPY YES QUITE WELL AND VERY HAPPY SAID DORA BUT SAY YOULL LET ME STOP AND SEE YOU WRITE WHY WHAT A SIGHT FOR SUCH BRIGHT EYES AT MIDNIGHT I REPLIED ARE THEY BRIGHT THOUGH RETURNED DORA LAUGHING IM SO GLAD THEYRE BRIGHT LITTLE VANITY SAID I BUT IT WAS NOT VANITY IT WAS ONLY HARMLESS DELIGHT IN MY ADMIRATION I KNEW THAT VERY WELL BEFORE SHE TOLD ME SO IF YOU THINK THEM PRETTY SAY I MAY ALWAYS STOP AND SEE YOU WRITE SAID DORA DO YOU THINK THEM PRETTY VERY PRETTY THEN LET ME ALWAYS STOP AND SEE YOU WRITE I AM AFRAID THAT WONT IMPROVE THEIR BRIGHTNESS DORA YES IT WILL BECAUSE YOU CLEVER BOY YOULL NOT FORGET ME THEN WHILE YOU ARE FULL OF SILENT FANCIES WILL YOU MIND IT IF I SAY SOMETHING VERY VERY SILLYMORE THAN USUAL INQUIRED DORA PEEPING OVER MY SHOULDER INTO MY FACE WHAT WONDERFUL THING IS THAT SAID I PLEASE LET ME HOLD THE PENS SAID DORA I WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH ALL THOSE MANY HOURS WHEN YOU ARE SO INDUSTRIOUS MAY I HOLD THE PENS THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER PRETTY JOY WHEN I SAID YES BRINGS TEARS INTO MY EYES THE NEXT TIME I SAT DOWN TO WRITE AND REGULARLY AFTERWARDS SHE SAT IN HER OLD PLACE WITH A SPARE BUNDLE OF PENS AT HER SIDE HER TRIUMPH IN THIS CONNEXION WITH MY WORK AND HER DELIGHT WHEN I WANTED A NEW PENWHICH I VERY OFTEN FEIGNED TO DOSUGGESTED TO ME A NEW WAY OF PLEASING MY CHILDWIFE I OCCASIONALLY MADE A PRETENCE OF WANTING A PAGE OR TWO OF MANUSCRIPT COPIED THEN DORA WAS IN HER GLORY THE PREPARATIONS SHE MADE FOR THIS GREAT WORK THE APRONS SHE PUT ON THE BIBS SHE BORROWED FROM THE KITCHEN TO KEEP OFF THE INK THE TIME SHE TOOK THE INNUMERABLE STOPPAGES SHE MADE TO HAVE A LAUGH WITH JIP AS IF HE UNDERSTOOD IT ALL HER CONVICTION THAT HER WORK WAS INCOMPLETE UNLESS SHE SIGNED HER NAME AT THE END AND THE WAY IN WHICH SHE WOULD BRING IT TO ME LIKE A SCHOOLCOPY AND THEN WHEN I PRAISED IT CLASP ME ROUND THE NECK ARE TOUCHING RECOLLECTIONS TO ME SIMPLE AS THEY MIGHT APPEAR TO OTHER MEN SHE TOOK POSSESSION OF THE KEYS SOON AFTER THIS AND WENT JINGLING ABOUT THE HOUSE WITH THE WHOLE BUNCH IN A LITTLE BASKET TIED TO HER SLENDER WAIST I SELDOM FOUND THAT THE PLACES TO WHICH THEY BELONGED WERE LOCKED OR THAT THEY WERE OF ANY USE EXCEPT AS A PLAYTHING FOR JIPBUT DORA WAS PLEASED AND THAT PLEASED ME SHE WAS QUITE SATISFIED THAT A GOOD DEAL WAS EFFECTED BY THIS MAKEBELIEF OF HOUSEKEEPING AND WAS AS MERRY AS IF WE HAD BEEN KEEPING A BABYHOUSE FOR A JOKE SO WE WENT ON DORA WAS HARDLY LESS AFFECTIONATE TO MY AUNT THAN TO ME AND OFTEN TOLD HER OF THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS AFRAID SHE WAS A CROSS OLD THING I NEVER SAW MY AUNT UNBEND MORE SYSTEMATICALLY TO ANYONE SHE COURTED JIP THOUGH JIP NEVER RESPONDED LISTENED DAY AFTER DAY TO THE GUITAR THOUGH I AM AFRAID SHE HAD NO TASTE FOR MUSIC NEVER ATTACKED THE INCAPABLES THOUGH THE TEMPTATION MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERE WENT WONDERFUL DISTANCES ON FOOT TO PURCHASE AS SURPRISES ANY TRIFLES THAT SHE FOUND OUT DORA WANTED AND NEVER CAME IN BY THE GARDEN AND MISSED HER FROM THE ROOM BUT SHE WOULD CALL OUT AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS IN A VOICE THAT SOUNDED CHEERFULLY ALL OVER THE HOUSE WHERES LITTLE BLOSSOM CHAPTER MR DICK FULFILS MY AUNTS PREDICTIONS IT WAS SOME TIME NOW SINCE I HAD LEFT THE DOCTOR LIVING IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I SAW HIM FREQUENTLY AND WE ALL WENT TO HIS HOUSE ON TWO OR THREE OCCASIONS TO DINNER OR TEA THE OLD SOLDIER WAS IN PERMANENT QUARTERS UNDER THE DOCTORS ROOF SHE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVER AND THE SAME IMMORTAL BUTTERFLIES HOVERED OVER HER CAP LIKE SOME OTHER MOTHERS WHOM I HAVE KNOWN IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFE MRS MARKLEHAM WAS FAR MORE FOND OF PLEASURE THAN HER DAUGHTER WAS SHE REQUIRED A GREAT DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND LIKE A DEEP OLD SOLDIER PRETENDED IN CONSULTING HER OWN INCLINATIONS TO BE DEVOTING HERSELF TO HER CHILD THE DOCTORS DESIRE THAT ANNIE SHOULD BE ENTERTAINED WAS THEREFORE PARTICULARLY ACCEPTABLE TO THIS EXCELLENT PARENT WHO EXPRESSED UNQUALIFIED APPROVAL OF HIS DISCRETION I HAVE NO DOUBT INDEED THAT SHE PROBED THE DOCTORS WOUND WITHOUT KNOWING IT MEANING NOTHING BUT A CERTAIN MATURED FRIVOLITY AND SELFISHNESS NOT ALWAYS INSEPARABLE FROM FULLBLOWN YEARS I THINK SHE CONFIRMED HIM IN HIS FEAR THAT HE WAS A CONSTRAINT UPON HIS YOUNG WIFE AND THAT THERE WAS NO CONGENIALITY OF FEELING BETWEEN THEM BY SO STRONGLY COMMENDING HIS DESIGN OF LIGHTENING THE LOAD OF HER LIFE MY DEAR SOUL SHE SAID TO HIM ONE DAY WHEN I WAS PRESENT YOU KNOW THERE IS NO DOUBT IT WOULD BE A LITTLE POKEY FOR ANNIE TO BE ALWAYS SHUT UP HERE THE DOCTOR NODDED HIS BENEVOLENT HEAD WHEN SHE COMES TO HER MOTHERS AGE SAID MRS MARKLEHAM WITH A FLOURISH OF HER FAN THEN ITLL BE ANOTHER THING YOU MIGHT PUT ME INTO A JAIL WITH GENTEEL SOCIETY AND A RUBBER AND I SHOULD NEVER CARE TO COME OUT BUT I AM NOT ANNIE YOU KNOW AND ANNIE IS NOT HER MOTHER SURELY SURELY SAID THE DOCTOR YOU ARE THE BEST OF CREATURESNO I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE DOCTOR MADE A GESTURE OF DEPRECATION I MUST SAY BEFORE YOUR FACE AS I ALWAYS SAY BEHIND YOUR BACK YOU ARE THE BEST OF CREATURES BUT OF COURSE YOU DONTNOW DO YOUENTER INTO THE SAME PURSUITS AND FANCIES AS ANNIE NO SAID THE DOCTOR IN A SORROWFUL TONE NO OF COURSE NOT RETORTED THE OLD SOLDIER TAKE YOUR DICTIONARY FOR EXAMPLE WHAT A USEFUL WORK A DICTIONARY IS WHAT A NECESSARY WORK THE MEANINGS OF WORDS WITHOUT DOCTOR JOHNSON OR SOMEBODY OF THAT SORT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT CALLING AN ITALIANIRON A BEDSTEAD BUT WE CANT EXPECT A DICTIONARYESPECIALLY WHEN ITS MAKINGTO INTEREST ANNIE CAN WE THE DOCTOR SHOOK HIS HEAD AND THATS WHY I SO MUCH APPROVE SAID MRS MARKLEHAM TAPPING HIM ON THE SHOULDER WITH HER SHUTUP FAN OF YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS IT SHOWS THAT YOU DONT EXPECT AS MANY ELDERLY PEOPLE DO EXPECT OLD HEADS ON YOUNG SHOULDERS YOU HAVE STUDIED ANNIES CHARACTER AND YOU UNDERSTAND IT THATS WHAT I FIND SO CHARMING EVEN THE CALM AND PATIENT FACE OF DOCTOR STRONG EXPRESSED SOME LITTLE SENSE OF PAIN I THOUGHT UNDER THE INFLICTION OF THESE COMPLIMENTS THEREFORE MY DEAR DOCTOR SAID THE OLD SOLDIER GIVING HIM SEVERAL AFFECTIONATE TAPS YOU MAY COMMAND ME AT ALL TIMES AND SEASONS NOW DO UNDERSTAND THAT I AM ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE I AM READY TO GO WITH ANNIE TO OPERAS CONCERTS EXHIBITIONS ALL KINDS OF PLACES AND YOU SHALL NEVER FIND THAT I AM TIRED DUTY MY DEAR DOCTOR BEFORE EVERY CONSIDERATION IN THE UNIVERSE SHE WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAN BEAR A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE AND SHE NEVER FLINCHED IN HER PERSEVERANCE IN THE CAUSE SHE SELDOM GOT HOLD OF THE NEWSPAPER WHICH SHE SETTLED HERSELF DOWN IN THE SOFTEST CHAIR IN THE HOUSE TO READ THROUGH AN EYEGLASS EVERY DAY FOR TWO HOURS BUT SHE FOUND OUT SOMETHING THAT SHE WAS CERTAIN ANNIE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT WAS IN VAIN FOR ANNIE TO PROTEST THAT SHE WAS WEARY OF SUCH THINGS HER MOTHERS REMONSTRANCE ALWAYS WAS NOW MY DEAR ANNIE I AM SURE YOU KNOW BETTER AND I MUST TELL YOU MY LOVE THAT YOU ARE NOT MAKING A PROPER RETURN FOR THE KINDNESS OF DOCTOR STRONG THIS WAS USUALLY SAID IN THE DOCTORS PRESENCE AND APPEARED TO ME TO CONSTITUTE ANNIES PRINCIPAL INDUCEMENT FOR WITHDRAWING HER OBJECTIONS WHEN SHE MADE ANY BUT IN GENERAL SHE RESIGNED HERSELF TO HER MOTHER AND WENT WHERE THE OLD SOLDIER WOULD IT RARELY HAPPENED NOW THAT MR MALDON ACCOMPANIED THEM SOMETIMES MY AUNT AND DORA WERE INVITED TO DO SO AND ACCEPTED THE INVITATION SOMETIMES DORA ONLY WAS ASKED THE TIME HAD BEEN WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNEASY IN HER GOING BUT REFLECTION ON WHAT HAD PASSED THAT FORMER NIGHT IN THE DOCTORS STUDY HAD MADE A CHANGE IN MY MISTRUST I BELIEVED THAT THE DOCTOR WAS RIGHT AND I HAD NO WORSE SUSPICIONS MY AUNT RUBBED HER NOSE SOMETIMES WHEN SHE HAPPENED TO BE ALONE WITH ME AND SAID SHE COULDNT MAKE IT OUT SHE WISHED THEY WERE HAPPIER SHE DIDNT THINK OUR MILITARY FRIEND SO SHE ALWAYS CALLED THE OLD SOLDIER MENDED THE MATTER AT ALL MY AUNT FURTHER EXPRESSED HER OPINION THAT IF OUR MILITARY FRIEND WOULD CUT OFF THOSE BUTTERFLIES AND GIVE EM TO THE CHIMNEYSWEEPERS FOR MAYDAY IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING SENSIBLE ON HER PART BUT HER ABIDING RELIANCE WAS ON MR DICK THAT MAN HAD EVIDENTLY AN IDEA IN HIS HEAD SHE SAID AND IF HE COULD ONLY ONCE PEN IT UP INTO A CORNER WHICH WAS HIS GREAT DIFFICULTY HE WOULD DISTINGUISH HIMSELF IN SOME EXTRAORDINARY MANNER UNCONSCIOUS OF THIS PREDICTION MR DICK CONTINUED TO OCCUPY PRECISELY THE SAME GROUND IN REFERENCE TO THE DOCTOR AND TO MRS STRONG HE SEEMED NEITHER TO ADVANCE NOR TO RECEDE HE APPEARED TO HAVE SETTLED INTO HIS ORIGINAL FOUNDATION LIKE A BUILDING AND I MUST CONFESS THAT MY FAITH IN HIS EVER MOVING WAS NOT MUCH GREATER THAN IF HE HAD BEEN A BUILDING BUT ONE NIGHT WHEN I HAD BEEN MARRIED SOME MONTHS MR DICK PUT HIS HEAD INTO THE PARLOUR WHERE I WAS WRITING ALONE DORA HAVING GONE OUT WITH MY AUNT TO TAKE TEA WITH THE TWO LITTLE BIRDS AND SAID WITH A SIGNIFICANT COUGH YOU COULDNT SPEAK TO ME WITHOUT INCONVENIENCING YOURSELF TROTWOOD I AM AFRAID CERTAINLY MR DICK SAID I COME IN TROTWOOD SAID MR DICK LAYING HIS FINGER ON THE SIDE OF HIS NOSE AFTER HE HAD SHAKEN HANDS WITH ME BEFORE I SIT DOWN I WISH TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION YOU KNOW YOUR AUNT A LITTLE I REPLIED SHE IS THE MOST WONDERFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD SIR AFTER THE DELIVERY OF THIS COMMUNICATION WHICH HE SHOT OUT OF HIMSELF AS IF HE WERE LOADED WITH IT MR DICK SAT DOWN WITH GREATER GRAVITY THAN USUAL AND

TROTWOOD RETURNED MR DICK LAUGHING AND REACHING ACROSS IN HIGH GLEE TO SHAKE HANDS WITH ME BUT I MEAN BOY RESUMING HIS GRAVITY WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER ME IN THIS RESPECT TOUCHING HIS FOREHEAD I WAS PUZZLED HOW TO ANSWER BUT HE HELPED ME WITH A WORD WEAK SAID MR DICK WELL I REPLIED DUBIOUSLY RATHER SO EXACTLY CRIED MR DICK WHO SEEMED QUITE ENCHANTED BY MY REPLY THAT IS TROTWOOD WHEN THEY TOOK SOME OF THE TROUBLE OUT OF YOUKNOWWHOS HEAD AND PUT IT YOU KNOW WHERE THERE WAS A MR DICK MADE HIS TWO HANDS REVOLVE VERY FAST ABOUT EACH OTHER A GREAT NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN BROUGHT THEM INTO COLLISION AND ROLLED THEM OVER AND OVER ONE ANOTHER TO EXPRESS CONFUSION THERE WAS THAT SORT OF THING DONE TO ME SOMEHOW EH I NODDED AT HIM AND HE NODDED BACK AGAIN IN SHORT BOY SAID MR DICK DROPPING HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER I AM SIMPLE I WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED THAT CONCLUSION BUT HE STOPPED ME YES I AM SHE PRETENDS I AM NOT SHE WONT HEAR OF IT BUT I AM I KNOW I AM IF SHE HADNT STOOD MY FRIEND SIR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHUT UP TO LEAD A DISMAL LIFE THESE MANY YEARS BUT ILL PROVIDE FOR HER I NEVER SPEND THE COPYING MONEY I PUT IT IN A BOX I HAVE MADE A WILL ILL LEAVE IT ALL TO HER SHE SHALL BE RICHNOBLE MR DICK TOOK OUT HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HIS EYES HE THEN FOLDED IT UP WITH GREAT CARE PRESSED IT SMOOTH BETWEEN HIS TWO HANDS PUT IT IN HIS POCKET AND SEEMED TO PUT MY AUNT AWAY WITH IT NOW YOU ARE A SCHOLAR TROTWOOD SAID MR DICK YOU ARE A FINE SCHOLAR YOU KNOW WHAT A LEARNED MAN WHAT A GREAT MAN THE DOCTOR IS YOU KNOW WHAT HONOUR HE HAS ALWAYS DONE ME NOT PROUD IN HIS WISDOM HUMBLE HUMBLECONDESCENDING EVEN TO POOR DICK WHO IS SIMPLE AND KNOWS NOTHING I HAVE SENT HIS NAME UP ON A SCRAP OF PAPER TO THE KITE ALONG THE STRING WHEN IT HAS BEEN IN THE SKY AMONG THE LARKS THE KITE HAS BEEN GLAD TO RECEIVE IT SIR AND THE SKY HAS BEEN BRIGHTER WITH IT I DELIGHTED HIM BY SAYING MOST HEARTILY THAT THE DOCTOR WAS DESERVING OF OUR BEST RESPECT AND HIGHEST ESTEEM AND HIS

ON ONE KNEE AT HIS FEET AND WITH HER HANDS IMPLORINGLY LIFTED FIXED UPON HIS FACE THE MEMORABLE LOOK I HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT AT THIS SIGHT MRS MARKLEHAM DROPPED THE NEWSPAPER AND STARED MORE LIKE A FIGUREHEAD INTENDED FOR A SHIP TO BE CALLED THE ASTONISHMENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE I CAN THINK OF THE GENTLENESS OF THE DOCTORS MANNER AND SURPRISE THE DIGNITY THAT MINGLED WITH THE SUPPLICATING ATTITUDE OF HIS WIFE THE AMIABLE CONCERN OF MR DICK AND THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH MY AUNT SAID TO HERSELF THAT MAN MAD TRIUMPHANTLY EXPRESSIVE OF THE MISERY FROM WHICH SHE HAD SAVED HIMI SEE AND HEAR RATHER

UNSUITABILITY OF MIND AND PURPOSE THERE IS NOTHING SAID ANNIE THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON I HAVE LONG FOUND THAT THERE IS NOTHING IF I WERE THANKFUL TO MY HUSBAND FOR NO MORE INSTEAD OF FOR SO MUCH I

VOICE WAS JUST AS QUIET AS BEFORE WHEN HE WAS WAITING TO BE THE OBJECT OF YOUR MUNIFICENCE SO FREELY BESTOWED FOR MY SAKE AND WHEN I WAS UNHAPPY IN THE MERCENARY SHAPE I WAS MADE TO WEAR I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BECOME HIM BETTER TO HAVE WORKED HIS OWN WAY ON I THOUGHT THAT IF I HAD BEEN HE I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO DO IT AT THE COST OF ALMOST ANY HARDSHIP BUT I THOUGHT NO WORSE OF HIM UNTIL THE NIGHT OF HIS DEPARTURE FOR INDIA THAT NIGHT I KNEW HE HAD A FALSE AND THANKLESS HEART I SAW A DOUBLE MEANING THEN IN MR WICKFIELDS SCRUTINY OF ME I PERCEIVED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE DARK SUSPICION THAT SHADOWED MY LIFE SUSPICION ANNIE SAID THE DOCTOR NO NO NO IN YOUR MIND THERE WAS NONE I KNOW MY HUSBAND SHE RETURNED AND WHEN I CAME TO YOU THAT NIGHT TO LAY DOWN ALL MY LOAD OF SHAME AND GRIEF AND

DISCLOSED TO ME FOR MY SURPRISE AND PLEASURE HAVE BEEN YOU WILL BELIEVE BUT AGGRAVATIONS OF THE UNHAPPINESS AND BURDEN OF MY SECRET SHE SUNK DOWN GENTLY AT THE DOCTORS FEET THOUGH HE DID HIS UTMOST TO PREVENT HER AND SAID LOOKING UP TEARFULLY INTO HIS FACE DO NOT SPEAK TO ME YET LET ME SAY A LITTLE MORE RIGHT OR WRONG IF THIS WERE TO BE DONE AGAIN I THINK I SHOULD DO JUST THE SAME YOU NEVER CAN KNOW WHAT IT WAS TO BE DEVOTED TO YOU WITH THOSE OLD ASSOCIATIONS TO FIND THAT ANYONE COULD BE SO HARD AS TO SUPPOSE THAT THE TRUTH OF MY HEART WAS BARTERED AWAY AND TO BE SURROUNDED BY APPEARANCES CONFIRMING THAT BELIEF I WAS VERY YOUNG AND HAD NO ADVISER BETWEEN MAMA AND ME IN ALL RELATING TO YOU THERE WAS A WIDE DIVISION IF I SHRUNK INTO MYSELF HIDING THE DISRESPECT I HAD UNDERGONE IT WAS BECAUSE I HONOURED YOU SO MUCH AND SO MUCH WISHED THAT YOU SHOULD HONOUR ME ANNIE MY PURE HEART SAID THE DOCTOR MY DEAR GIRL A LITTLE MORE A VERY FEW WORDS MORE I USED TO THINK THERE WERE SO MANY WHOM

CHAPTER INTELLIGENCE I MUST HAVE BEEN MARRIED IF I MAY TRUST TO MY IMPERFECT MEMORY FOR DATES ABOUT A YEAR OR SO WHEN ONE EVENING AS I WAS RETURNING FROM A SOLITARY WALK THINKING OF THE BOOK I WAS THEN WRITINGFOR MY SUCCESS HAD STEADILY INCREASED WITH MY STEADY APPLICATION AND I WAS ENGAGED AT THAT TIME UPON MY FIRST WORK OF FICTIONI CAME PAST MRS STEERFORTHS HOUSE I HAD OFTEN PASSED IT BEFORE DURING MY RESIDENCE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD THOUGH NEVER WHEN I COULD CHOOSE ANOTHER ROAD HOWBEIT IT DID SOMETIMES HAPPEN THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND ANOTHER WITHOUT MAKING A LONG CIRCUIT AND SO I HAD PASSED THAT WAY UPON THE WHOLE PRETTY OFTEN I HAD NEVER DONE MORE THAN GLANCE AT THE HOUSE AS I WENT BY WITH A QUICKENED STEP IT HAD BEEN UNIFORMLY GLOOMY AND DULL NONE OF THE BEST ROOMS ABUTTED ON THE ROAD AND THE NARROW HEAVILYFRAMED OLDFASHIONED WINDOWS NEVER CHEERFUL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES LOOKED VERY DISMAL CLOSE SHUT AND WITH THEIR BLINDS ALWAYS DRAWN DOWN THERE WAS A COVERED WAY ACROSS A LITTLE PAVED COURT TO AN ENTRANCE THAT WAS NEVER USED AND THERE WAS ONE ROUND STAIRCASE WINDOW AT ODDS WITH ALL THE REST AND THE ONLY ONE UNSHADED BY A BLIND WHICH HAD THE SAME UNOCCUPIED BLANK LOOK I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT I EVER SAW A LIGHT IN ALL THE HOUSE IF I HAD BEEN A CASUAL PASSERBY I SHOULD HAVE PROBABLY SUPPOSED THAT SOME CHILDLESS PERSON LAY DEAD IN IT IF I HAD HAPPILY POSSESSED NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLACE AND HAD SEEN IT OFTEN IN THAT CHANGELESS STATE I SHOULD HAVE PLEASED MY FANCY WITH MANY INGENIOUS SPECULATIONS I DARE SAY AS IT WAS I THOUGHT AS LITTLE OF IT AS I MIGHT BUT MY MIND COULD NOT GO BY IT AND LEAVE IT AS MY BODY DID AND IT USUALLY AWAKENED A LONG TRAIN OF MEDITATIONS COMING BEFORE ME ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING THAT I MENTION MINGLED WITH THE CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS AND LATER FANCIES THE GHOSTS OF HALFFORMED HOPES THE BROKEN SHADOWS OF DISAPPOINTMENTS DIMLY SEEN AND UNDERSTOOD THE BLENDING OF EXPERIENCE AND IMAGINATION INCIDENTAL TO THE OCCUPATION WITH WHICH MY THOUGHTS HAD BEEN BUSY IT WAS MORE THAN COMMONLY SUGGESTIVE I FELL INTO A BROWN STUDY AS I WALKED ON AND A VOICE AT MY SIDE MADE ME START IT WAS A WOMANS VOICE TOO I WAS NOT LONG IN RECOLLECTING MRS STEERFORTHS LITTLE PARLOURMAID WHO HAD FORMERLY WORN BLUE RIBBONS IN HER CAP SHE HAD TAKEN THEM OUT NOW TO ADAPT HERSELF I SUPPOSE TO THE ALTERED CHARACTER OF THE HOUSE AND WORE BUT

THE SAME MISS DARTLE SAW YOU PASS A NIGHT OR TWO AGO AND I WAS TO SIT AT WORK ON THE STAIRCASE AND WHEN I SAW YOU PASS AGAIN TO ASK YOU TO STEP IN AND SPEAK TO HER I TURNED BACK AND INQUIRED OF MY CONDUCTOR AS WE WENT ALONG HOW MRS STEERFORTH WAS SHE SAID HER LADY WAS BUT POORLY AND KEPT HER OWN ROOM A GOOD DEAL WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE I WAS DIRECTED TO MISS DARTLE IN THE GARDEN AND LEFT TO MAKE MY PRESENCE KNOWN TO HER MYSELF SHE WAS SITTING ON A SEAT AT ONE END OF A KIND OF TERRACE OVERLOOKING THE GREAT CITY IT WAS A SOMBRE EVENING WITH A LURID LIGHT IN THE SKY AND AS I SAW THE PROSPECT SCOWLING IN THE DISTANCE WITH HERE AND THERE SOME LARGER OBJECT STARTING UP INTO THE SULLEN GLARE I FANCIED IT WAS NO INAPT COMPANION TO THE MEMORY OF THIS FIERCE WOMAN SHE SAW ME AS I ADVANCED AND ROSE FOR A MOMENT TO RECEIVE ME I THOUGHT HER THEN STILL MORE COLOURLESS AND THIN THAN WHEN I HAD SEEN HER LAST THE FLASHING EYES STILL BRIGHTER AND THE SCAR STILL PLAINER OUR MEETING WAS NOT CORDIAL WE HAD PARTED ANGRILY ON THE LAST OCCASION AND THERE WAS AN AIR OF DISDAIN ABOUT HER WHICH SHE TOOK NO PAINS TO CONCEAL I AM TOLD YOU WISH TO SPEAK TO ME MISS DARTLE SAID I STANDING NEAR HER WITH MY HAND UPON THE BACK OF THE SEAT AND DECLINING HER GESTURE OF INVITATION TO SIT DOWN IF YOU PLEASE SAID SHE PRAY HAS THIS GIRL BEEN FOUND NO AND YET SHE HAS RUN AWAY I SAW HER THIN LIPS WORKING WHILE SHE LOOKED AT ME AS IF THEY WERE EAGER TO LOAD HER WITH REPROACHES RUN AWAY I REPEATED YES FROM HIM SHE SAID WITH A LAUGH IF SHE IS NOT FOUND PERHAPS SHE NEVER WILL BE FOUND SHE MAY BE DEAD THE VAUNTING CRUELTY WITH WHICH SHE MET MY GLANCE I NEVER SAW EXPRESSED IN ANY OTHER FACE THAT EVER I HAVE SEEN TO WISH HER DEAD SAID I MAY BE THE KINDEST WISH THAT ONE OF HER OWN SEX COULD BESTOW UPON HER I AM GLAD THAT TIME HAS SOFTENED YOU SO MUCH MISS DARTLE SHE CONDESCENDED TO MAKE NO REPLY BUT TURNING ON ME WITH ANOTHER SCORNFUL LAUGH SAID THE FRIENDS OF THIS EXCELLENT AND MUCHINJURED YOUNG LADY ARE FRIENDS OF YOURS YOU ARE THEIR CHAMPION AND ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS DO YOU WISH TO KNOW WHAT IS KNOWN OF HER YES SAID I SHE ROSE WITH AN ILLFAVOURED SMILE AND TAKING A FEW STEPS TOWARDS A WALL OF HOLLY THAT WAS NEAR AT HAND DIVIDING THE LAWN FROM A KITCHENGARDEN SAID IN A LOUDER VOICE COME HEREAS IF SHE WERE CALLING TO SOME UNCLEAN BEAST YOU WILL RESTRAIN ANY DEMONSTRATIVE CHAMPIONSHIP OR VENGEANCE IN THIS PLACE OF COURSE MR COPPERFIELD SAID SHE LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER AT ME WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION I INCLINED MY HEAD WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SHE MEANT AND SHE SAID COME HERE AGAIN AND RETURNED FOLLOWED BY THE RESPECTABLE MR LITTIMER WHO WITH UNDIMINISHED RESPECTABILITY MADE ME A BOW AND TOOK UP HIS POSITION BEHIND HER THE AIR OF WICKED GRACE OF TRIUMPH IN WHICH STRANGE TO SAY THERE WAS YET SOMETHING FEMININE AND ALLURING WITH WHICH SHE RECLINED UPON THE SEAT BETWEEN US AND LOOKED AT ME WAS WORTHY OF A CRUEL PRINCESS IN A LEGEND NOW SAID SHE IMPERIOUSLY WITHOUT GLANCING AT HIM AND TOUCHING THE OLD WOUND AS IT THROBBED PERHAPS IN THIS INSTANCE WITH PLEASURE RATHER THAN PAIN TELL MR COPPERFIELD ABOUT THE FLIGHT MR JAMES AND MYSELF MAAM DONT ADDRESS YOURSELF TO ME SHE INTERRUPTED WITH A FROWN MR JAMES AND MYSELF SIR NOR TO ME IF YOU PLEASE SAID I MR LITTIMER WITHOUT BEING AT ALL DISCOMPOSED SIGNIFIED BY A SLIGHT OBEISANCE THAT ANYTHING THAT WAS MOST AGREEABLE TO US WAS MOST AGREEABLE TO HIM AND BEGAN AGAIN MR JAMES AND MYSELF HAVE BEEN ABROAD WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN EVER SINCE SHE LEFT YARMOUTH UNDER MR JAMESS PROTECTION WE HAVE BEEN IN A VARIETY OF PLACES AND SEEN A DEAL OF FOREIGN COUNTRY WE HAVE BEEN IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND ITALY IN FACT ALMOST ALL PARTS HE LOOKED AT THE BACK OF THE SEAT AS IF HE WERE ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THAT AND SOFTLY PLAYED UPON IT WITH HIS HANDS AS IF HE WERE STRIKING CHORDS UPON A DUMB PIANO MR JAMES TOOK QUITE UNCOMMONLY TO THE YOUNG WOMAN AND WAS MORE SETTLED FOR A LENGTH OF TIME THAN I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO BE SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN HIS SERVICE THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS VERY IMPROVABLE AND SPOKE THE LANGUAGES AND WOULDNT HAVE BEEN KNOWN FOR THE SAME COUNTRYPERSON I NOTICED THAT SHE WAS MUCH ADMIRED WHEREVER WE WENT MISS DARTLE PUT HER HAND UPON HER SIDE I SAW HIM STEAL A GLANCE AT HER AND SLIGHTLY SMILE TO HIMSELF VERY MUCH ADMIRED INDEED THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS WHAT WITH HER DRESS WHAT WITH THE AIR AND SUN WHAT WITH BEING MADE SO MUCH OF WHAT WITH THIS THAT AND THE OTHER HER MERITS REALLY ATTRACTED GENERAL NOTICE HE MADE A SHORT PAUSE HER EYES WANDERED RESTLESSLY OVER THE DISTANT PROSPECT AND SHE BIT HER NETHER LIP TO STOP THAT BUSY MOUTH TAKING HIS HANDS FROM THE SEAT AND PLACING ONE OF THEM WITHIN THE OTHER AS HE SETTLED HIMSELF ON ONE LEG MR LITTIMER PROCEEDED WITH HIS EYES CAST DOWN AND HIS RESPECTABLE HEAD A LITTLE ADVANCED AND A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE THE YOUNG WOMAN WENT ON IN THIS MANNER FOR SOME TIME BEING OCCASIONALLY LOW IN HER SPIRITS UNTIL I THINK SHE BEGAN TO WEARY MR JAMES BY GIVING WAY TO HER LOW SPIRITS AND TEMPERS OF THAT KIND AND THINGS WERE NOT SO COMFORTABLE MR JAMES HE BEGAN TO BE RESTLESS AGAIN THE MORE RESTLESS HE GOT THE WORSE SHE GOT AND I MUST SAY FOR MYSELF THAT I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME OF IT INDEED BETWEEN THE TWO STILL MATTERS WERE PATCHED UP HERE AND MADE GOOD THERE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND ALTOGETHER LASTED I AM SURE FOR A LONGER TIME THAN ANYBODY COULD HAVE EXPECTED RECALLING HER EYES FROM THE DISTANCE SHE LOOKED AT ME AGAIN NOW WITH HER FORMER AIR MR LITTIMER CLEARING HIS THROAT BEHIND HIS HAND WITH A RESPECTABLE SHORT COUGH CHANGED LEGS AND WENT ON AT LAST WHEN THERE HAD BEEN UPON THE WHOLE A GOOD MANY WORDS AND REPROACHES MR JAMES HE SET OFF ONE MORNING FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF NAPLES WHERE WE HAD A VILLA THE YOUNG WOMAN BEING VERY PARTIAL TO THE SEA AND UNDER PRETENCE OF COMING BACK IN A DAY OR SO LEFT IT IN CHARGE WITH ME TO BREAK IT OUT THAT FOR THE GENERAL HAPPINESS OF ALL CONCERNED HE WASHERE AN INTERRUPTION OF THE SHORT COUGHGONE BUT MR JAMES I MUST SAY CERTAINLY DID BEHAVE EXTREMELY HONOURABLE FOR HE PROPOSED THAT THE YOUNG WOMAN SHOULD MARRY A VERY RESPECTABLE PERSON WHO WAS FULLY PREPARED TO OVERLOOK THE PAST AND WHO WAS AT LEAST AS GOOD AS ANYBODY THE YOUNG WOMAN COULD HAVE ASPIRED TO IN A REGULAR WAY HER CONNEXIONS BEING VERY COMMON HE CHANGED LEGS AGAIN AND WETTED HIS LIPS I WAS CONVINCED THAT THE SCOUNDREL SPOKE OF HIMSELF AND I SAW MY CONVICTION REFLECTED IN MISS DARTLES FACE THIS I ALSO HAD IT IN CHARGE TO COMMUNICATE I WAS WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO RELIEVE MR JAMES FROM HIS DIFFICULTY AND TO RESTORE HARMONY BETWEEN HIMSELF AND AN AFFECTIONATE PARENT WHO HAS UNDERGONE SO MUCH ON HIS ACCOUNT THEREFORE I UNDERTOOK THE COMMISSION THE YOUNG WOMANS VIOLENCE WHEN SHE CAME TO AFTER I BROKE THE FACT OF HIS DEPARTURE WAS BEYOND ALL EXPECTATIONS SHE WAS QUITE MAD AND HAD TO BE HELD BY FORCE OR IF SHE COULDNT HAVE GOT TO A KNIFE OR GOT TO THE SEA SHED HAVE BEATEN HER HEAD AGAINST THE MARBLE FLOOR MISS DARTLE LEANING BACK UPON THE SEAT WITH A LIGHT OF EXULTATION IN HER FACE SEEMED ALMOST TO CARESS THE SOUNDS THIS FELLOW HAD UTTERED BUT WHEN I CAME TO THE SECOND PART OF WHAT HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED TO ME SAID MR LITTIMER RUBBING HIS HANDS UNEASILY WHICH ANYBODY MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED WOULD HAVE BEEN AT ALL EVENTS APPRECIATED AS A KIND INTENTION THEN THE YOUNG WOMAN CAME OUT IN HER TRUE COLOURS A MORE OUTRAGEOUS PERSON I NEVER DID SEE HER CONDUCT WAS SURPRISINGLY BAD SHE HAD NO MORE GRATITUDE NO MORE FEELING NO MORE PATIENCE NO MORE REASON IN HER THAN A STOCK OR A STONE IF I HADNT BEEN UPON MY GUARD I AM CONVINCED SHE WOULD HAVE HAD MY BLOOD I THINK THE BETTER OF HER FOR IT SAID I INDIGNANTLY MR LITTIMER BENT HIS HEAD AS MUCH AS TO SAY INDEED SIR BUT YOURE YOUNG AND RESUMED HIS NARRATIVE IT WAS NECESSARY IN SHORT FOR A TIME TO TAKE AWAY EVERYTHING NIGH HER THAT SHE COULD DO HERSELF OR ANYBODY ELSE AN INJURY WITH AND TO SHUT HER UP CLOSE NOTWITHSTANDING WHICH SHE GOT OUT IN THE NIGHT FORCED THE LATTICE OF A WINDOW THAT I HAD NAILED UP MYSELF DROPPED ON A VINE THAT WAS TRAILED BELOW AND NEVER HAS BEEN SEEN OR HEARD OF TO MY KNOWLEDGE SINCE SHE IS DEAD PERHAPS SAID MISS DARTLE WITH A SMILE AS IF SHE COULD HAVE SPURNED THE BODY OF THE RUINED GIRL SHE MAY HAVE DROWNED HERSELF MISS RETURNED MR LITTIMER CATCHING AT AN EXCUSE FOR ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO SOMEBODY ITS VERY POSSIBLE OR SHE MAY HAVE HAD ASSISTANCE FROM THE BOATMEN AND THE BOATMENS WIVES AND CHILDREN BEING GIVEN TO LOW COMPANY SHE WAS VERY MUCH IN THE HABIT OF TALKING TO THEM ON THE BEACH MISS DARTLE AND SITTING BY THEIR BOATS I HAVE KNOWN HER DO IT WHEN MR JAMES HAS BEEN AWAY WHOLE DAYS MR JAMES WAS FAR FROM PLEASED TO FIND OUT ONCE THAT SHE HAD TOLD THE CHILDREN SHE WAS A BOATMANS DAUGHTER AND THAT IN HER OWN COUNTRY LONG AGO SHE HAD ROAMED ABOUT THE BEACH LIKE THEM OH EMILY UNHAPPY BEAUTY WHAT A PICTURE ROSE BEFORE ME OF HER SITTING ON THE FAROFF SHORE AMONG THE CHILDREN LIKE HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS INNOCENT LISTENING TO LITTLE VOICES SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE CALLED HER MOTHER HAD SHE BEEN A POOR MANS WIFE AND TO THE GREAT VOICE OF THE SEA WITH ITS ETERNAL NEVER MORE WHEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE MISS DARTLE DID I TELL YOU NOT TO SPEAK TO ME SHE SAID WITH STERN CONTEMPT YOU SPOKE TO ME MISS HE REPLIED I BEG YOUR PARDON BUT IT IS MY SERVICE TO OBEY DO YOUR SERVICE SHE RETURNED FINISH YOUR STORY AND GO WHEN IT WAS CLEAR HE SAID WITH INFINITE RESPECTABILITY AND AN OBEDIENT BOW THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND I WENT TO MR JAMES AT THE PLACE WHERE IT HAD BEEN AGREED THAT I SHOULD WRITE TO HIM AND INFORMED HIM OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED WORDS PASSED BETWEEN US IN CONSEQUENCE AND I FELT IT DUE TO MY CHARACTER TO LEAVE HIM I COULD BEAR AND I HAVE BORNE A GREAT DEAL FROM MR JAMES BUT HE INSULTED ME TOO FAR HE HURT ME KNOWING THE UNFORTUNATE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS MOTHER AND WHAT HER ANXIETY OF MIND WAS LIKELY TO BE I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF COMING HOME TO ENGLAND AND RELATING FOR MONEY WHICH I PAID HIM SAID MISS DARTLE TO ME JUST SO MAAMAND RELATING WHAT I KNEW I AM NOT AWARE SAID MR LITTIMER AFTER A MOMENTS REFLECTION THAT THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE I AM AT PRESENT OUT OF EMPLOYMENT AND SHOULD BE HAPPY TO MEET WITH A RESPECTABLE SITUATION MISS DARTLE GLANCED AT ME AS THOUGH SHE WOULD INQUIRE IF THERE WERE ANYTHING THAT I DESIRED TO ASK AS THERE WAS SOMETHING WHICH HAD OCCURRED TO MY MIND I SAID IN REPLY I COULD WISH TO KNOW FROM THISCREATURE I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO UTTER ANY MORE CONCILIATORY WORD WHETHER THEY INTERCEPTED A LETTER THAT WAS WRITTEN TO HER FROM HOME OR WHETHER HE SUPPOSES THAT SHE RECEIVED IT HE REMAINED CALM AND SILENT WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND AND THE TIP OF EVERY FINGER OF HIS RIGHT HAND DELICATELY POISED AGAINST THE TIP OF EVERY FINGER OF HIS LEFT MISS DARTLE TURNED HER HEAD DISDAINFULLY TOWARDS HIM I BEG YOUR PARDON MISS HE SAID AWAKENING FROM HIS ABSTRACTION BUT HOWEVER SUBMISSIVE TO YOU I HAVE MY POSITION THOUGH A SERVANT MR COPPERFIELD AND YOU MISS ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE IF MR COPPERFIELD WISHES TO KNOW ANYTHING FROM ME I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF REMINDING MR COPPERFIELD THAT HE CAN PUT A QUESTION TO ME I HAVE A CHARACTER TO MAINTAIN AFTER A MOMENTARY STRUGGLE WITH MYSELF I TURNED MY EYES UPON HIM AND SAID YOU HAVE HEARD MY QUESTION CONSIDER IT ADDRESSED TO YOURSELF IF YOU CHOOSE WHAT ANSWER DO YOU MAKE SIR HE REJOINED WITH AN OCCASIONAL SEPARATION AND REUNION OF THOSE DELICATE TIPS MY ANSWER MUST BE QUALIFIED BECAUSE TO BETRAY MR JAMESS CONFIDENCE TO HIS MOTHER AND TO BETRAY IT TO YOU ARE TWO DIFFERENT ACTIONS IT IS NOT PROBABLE I CONSIDER THAT MR JAMES WOULD ENCOURAGE THE RECEIPT OF LETTERS LIKELY TO INCREASE LOW SPIRITS AND UNPLEASANTNESS BUT FURTHER THAN THAT SIR I SHOULD WISH TO AVOID GOING IS THAT ALL INQUIRED MISS DARTLE OF ME I INDICATED THAT I HAD NOTHING MORE TO SAY EXCEPT I ADDED AS I SAW HIM MOVING OFF THAT I UNDERSTAND THIS FELLOWS PART IN THE WICKED STORY AND THAT AS I SHALL MAKE IT KNOWN TO THE HONEST MAN WHO HAS BEEN HER FATHER FROM HER CHILDHOOD I WOULD RECOMMEND HIM TO AVOID GOING TOO MUCH INTO PUBLIC HE HAD STOPPED THE MOMENT I BEGAN AND HAD LISTENED WITH HIS USUAL REPOSE OF MANNER THANK YOU SIR BUT YOULL EXCUSE ME IF I SAY SIR THAT THERE ARE NEITHER SLAVES NOR SLAVEDRIVERS IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS IF THEY DO IT IS MORE TO THEIR OWN PERIL I BELIEVE THAN TO OTHER PEOPLES CONSEQUENTLY SPEAKING I AM NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF GOING WHEREVER I MAY WISH SIR WITH THAT HE MADE A POLITE BOW AND WITH ANOTHER TO MISS DARTLE WENT AWAY THROUGH THE ARCH IN THE WALL OF HOLLY BY WHICH HE HAD COME MISS DARTLE AND I REGARDED EACH OTHER FOR A LITTLE WHILE IN SILENCE HER MANNER BEING EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS WHEN SHE HAD PRODUCED THE MAN HE SAYS BESIDES SHE OBSERVED WITH A SLOW CURLING OF HER LIP THAT HIS MASTER AS HE HEARS IS COASTING SPAIN AND THIS DONE IS AWAY TO GRATIFY HIS SEAFARING TASTES TILL HE IS WEARY BUT THIS IS OF NO INTEREST TO YOU BETWEEN THESE TWO PROUD PERSONS MOTHER AND SON THERE IS A WIDER BREACH THAN BEFORE AND LITTLE HOPE OF ITS HEALING FOR THEY ARE ONE AT HEART AND TIME MAKES EACH MORE OBSTINATE AND IMPERIOUS NEITHER IS THIS OF ANY INTEREST TO YOU BUT IT INTRODUCES WHAT I WISH TO SAY THIS DEVIL WHOM YOU MAKE AN ANGEL OF I MEAN THIS LOW GIRL WHOM HE PICKED OUT OF THE TIDEMUD WITH HER BLACK EYES FULL UPON ME AND HER PASSIONATE FINGER UP MAY BE ALIVEFOR I BELIEVE SOME COMMON THINGS ARE HARD TO DIE IF SHE IS YOU WILL DESIRE TO HAVE A PEARL OF SUCH PRICE FOUND AND TAKEN CARE OF WE DESIRE THAT TOO THAT HE MAY NOT BY ANY CHANCE BE MADE HER PREY AGAIN SO FAR WE ARE UNITED IN ONE INTEREST AND THAT IS WHY I WHO WOULD DO HER ANY MISCHIEF THAT SO COARSE A WRETCH IS CAPABLE OF FEELING HAVE SENT FOR YOU TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD I SAW BY THE CHANGE IN HER FACE THAT SOMEONE WAS ADVANCING BEHIND ME IT WAS MRS STEERFORTH WHO GAVE ME HER HAND MORE COLDLY THAN OF YORE AND WITH AN AUGMENTATION OF HER FORMER STATELINESS OF MANNER BUT STILL I PERCEIVEDAND I WAS TOUCHED BY ITWITH AN INEFFACEABLE REMEMBRANCE OF MY OLD LOVE FOR HER SON SHE WAS GREATLY ALTERED HER FINE FIGURE WAS FAR LESS UPRIGHT HER HANDSOME FACE WAS DEEPLY MARKED AND HER HAIR WAS ALMOST WHITE BUT WHEN SHE SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT SHE WAS A HANDSOME LADY STILL AND WELL I KNEW THE BRIGHT EYE WITH ITS LOFTY LOOK THAT HAD BEEN A LIGHT IN MY VERY DREAMS AT SCHOOL IS MR COPPERFIELD INFORMED OF EVERYTHING ROSA YES AND HAS HE HEARD LITTIMER HIMSELF YES I HAVE TOLD HIM WHY YOU WISHED IT YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL I HAVE HAD SOME SLIGHT CORRESPONDENCE WITH YOUR FORMER FRIEND SIR ADDRESSING ME BUT IT HAS NOT RESTORED HIS SENSE OF DUTY OR NATURAL OBLIGATION THEREFORE I HAVE NO OTHER OBJECT IN THIS THAN WHAT ROSA HAS MENTIONED IF BY THE COURSE WHICH MAY RELIEVE THE MIND OF THE DECENT MAN YOU BROUGHT HERE FOR WHOM I AM SORRYI CAN SAY NO MORE MY SON MAY BE SAVED FROM AGAIN FALLING INTO THE SNARES OF A DESIGNING ENEMY WELL SHE DREW HERSELF UP AND SAT LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HER FAR AWAY MADAM I SAID RESPECTFULLY I UNDERSTAND I ASSURE YOU I AM IN NO DANGER OF PUTTING ANY STRAINED CONSTRUCTION ON YOUR MOTIVES BUT I MUST SAY EVEN TO YOU HAVING KNOWN THIS INJURED FAMILY FROM CHILDHOOD THAT IF YOU SUPPOSE THE GIRL SO DEEPLY WRONGED HAS NOT BEEN CRUELLY DELUDED AND WOULD NOT RATHER DIE A HUNDRED DEATHS THAN TAKE A CUP OF WATER FROM YOUR SONS HAND NOW YOU CHERISH A TERRIBLE MISTAKE WELL ROSA WELL SAID MRS STEERFORTH AS THE OTHER WAS ABOUT TO INTERPOSE IT IS NO MATTER LET IT BE YOU ARE MARRIED SIR I AM TOLD I ANSWERED THAT I HAD BEEN SOME TIME MARRIED AND ARE DOING WELL I HEAR LITTLE IN THE QUIET LIFE I LEAD BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE BEGINNING TO BE FAMOUS I HAVE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE I SAID AND FIND MY NAME CONNECTED WITH SOME PRAISE YOU HAVE NO MOTHERIN A SOFTENED VOICE NO IT IS A PITY SHE RETURNED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD OF YOU GOOD NIGHT I TOOK THE HAND SHE HELD OUT WITH A DIGNIFIED UNBENDING AIR AND IT WAS AS CALM IN MINE AS IF HER BREAST HAD BEEN AT PEACE HER PRIDE COULD STILL ITS VERY PULSES IT APPEARED AND DRAW THE PLACID VEIL BEFORE HER FACE THROUGH WHICH SHE SAT LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HER ON THE FAR DISTANCE AS I MOVED AWAY FROM THEM ALONG THE TERRACE I COULD NOT HELP OBSERVING HOW STEADILY THEY BOTH SAT GAZING ON THE PROSPECT AND HOW IT THICKENED AND CLOSED AROUND THEM HERE AND THERE SOME EARLY LAMPS WERE SEEN TO TWINKLE IN THE DISTANT CITY AND IN THE EASTERN QUARTER OF THE SKY THE LURID LIGHT STILL HOVERED BUT FROM THE GREATER PART OF THE BROAD VALLEY INTERPOSED A MIST WAS RISING LIKE A SEA WHICH MINGLING WITH THE DARKNESS MADE IT SEEM AS IF THE GATHERING WATERS WOULD ENCOMPASS THEM I HAVE REASON TO REMEMBER THIS AND THINK OF IT WITH AWE FOR BEFORE I LOOKED UPON THOSE TWO AGAIN A STORMY SEA HAD RISEN TO THEIR FEET REFLECTING ON WHAT HAD BEEN THUS TOLD ME I FELT IT RIGHT THAT IT SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED TO MR PEGGOTTY ON THE FOLLOWING EVENING I WENT INTO LONDON IN QUEST OF HIM HE WAS ALWAYS WANDERING ABOUT FROM PLACE TO PLACE WITH HIS ONE OBJECT OF RECOVERING HIS NIECE BEFORE HIM BUT WAS MORE IN LONDON THAN ELSEWHERE OFTEN AND OFTEN NOW HAD I SEEN HIM IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT PASSING ALONG THE STREETS SEARCHING AMONG THE FEW WHO LOITERED OUT OF DOORS AT THOSE UNTIMELY HOURS FOR WHAT HE DREADED TO FIND HE KEPT A LODGING OVER THE LITTLE CHANDLERS SHOP IN HUNGERFORD MARKET WHICH I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO MENTION MORE THAN ONCE AND FROM WHICH HE FIRST WENT FORTH UPON HIS ERRAND OF MERCY HITHER I DIRECTED MY WALK ON MAKING INQUIRY FOR HIM I LEARNED FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD NOT GONE OUT YET AND I SHOULD FIND HIM IN HIS ROOM UPSTAIRS HE WAS SITTING READING BY A WINDOW IN WHICH HE KEPT A FEW PLANTS THE ROOM WAS VERY NEAT AND ORDERLY I SAW IN A MOMENT THAT IT WAS ALWAYS KEPT PREPARED FOR HER RECEPTION AND THAT HE NEVER WENT OUT BUT HE THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE HE MIGHT BRING HER HOME HE HAD NOT HEARD MY TAP AT THE DOOR AND ONLY RAISED HIS EYES WHEN I LAID MY HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER MASR DAVY THANKEE SIR THANKEE HEARTY FOR THIS VISIT SIT YE DOWN YOURE KINDLY WELCOME SIR MR PEGGOTTY SAID I TAKING THE CHAIR HE HANDED ME DONT EXPECT MUCH I HAVE HEARD SOME NEWS OF EMLY HE PUT HIS HAND IN

TO ALL I HAD TO TELL I WELL REMEMBER THE SENSE OF DIGNITY BEAUTY EVEN WITH WHICH THE PATIENT GRAVITY OF HIS FACE IMPRESSED ME WHEN HAVING GRADUALLY REMOVED HIS EYES FROM MINE HE SAT LOOKING DOWNWARD LEANING HIS FOREHEAD ON HIS HAND HE OFFERED NO INTERRUPTION BUT REMAINED THROUGHOUT PERFECTLY STILL HE SEEMED TO PURSUE HER FIGURE THROUGH THE NARRATIVE AND TO LET EVERY OTHER SHAPE GO BY HIM AS IF IT WERE NOTHING WHEN I HAD DONE HE SHADED HIS FACE AND CONTINUED SILENT I LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND OCCUPIED MYSELF WITH THE PLANTS HOW DO YOU FARE TO FEEL ABOUT IT MASR DAVY HE

IN HIM I DOENT KNOW AS HED DO VIOLENCE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT I HOPE AS THEM TWO MAY BE KEP ASUNDERS WE HAD COME THROUGH TEMPLE BAR INTO THE CITY CONVERSING NO MORE NOW AND WALKING AT MY SIDE HE YIELDED HIMSELF UP TO THE ONE AIM OF HIS DEVOTED LIFE AND WENT ON WITH THAT HUSHED CONCENTRATION OF HIS FACULTIES WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE HIS FIGURE SOLITARY IN A MULTITUDE WE WERE NOT FAR FROM BLACKFRIARS BRIDGE WHEN HE TURNED HIS HEAD AND POINTED TO A SOLITARY FEMALE FIGURE FLITTING ALONG THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET I KNEW IT READILY TO BE THE FIGURE THAT WE SOUGHT WE CROSSED THE ROAD AND WERE PRESSING ON TOWARDS HER WHEN IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT SHE MIGHT BE MORE DISPOSED TO FEEL A WOMANS INTEREST IN THE LOST GIRL IF WE SPOKE TO HER IN A QUIETER PLACE ALOOF FROM THE CROWD AND WHERE WE SHOULD BE LESS OBSERVED I ADVISED MY COMPANION THEREFORE THAT WE SHOULD NOT ADDRESS HER YET BUT FOLLOW HER CONSULTING IN THIS LIKEWISE AN INDISTINCT DESIRE I HAD TO KNOW WHERE SHE WENT HE ACQUIESCING WE FOLLOWED AT A DISTANCE NEVER LOSING SIGHT OF HER BUT NEVER CARING TO COME VERY NEAR AS SHE FREQUENTLY LOOKED ABOUT ONCE SHE STOPPED TO LISTEN TO A BAND OF MUSIC AND THEN WE STOPPED TOO SHE WENT ON A LONG WAY STILL WE WENT ON IT WAS EVIDENT FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE HELD HER COURSE THAT SHE WAS GOING TO SOME FIXED DESTINATION AND THIS AND HER KEEPING IN THE BUSY STREETS AND I SUPPOSE THE STRANGE FASCINATION IN THE SECRECY AND MYSTERY OF SO FOLLOWING ANYONE MADE ME ADHERE TO MY FIRST PURPOSE AT LENGTH SHE TURNED INTO A DULL DARK STREET WHERE THE NOISE AND CROWD WERE LOST AND I SAID WE MAY SPEAK TO HER NOW AND MENDING OUR PACE WE WENT AFTER HER CHAPTER MARTHA WE WERE NOW DOWN IN WESTMINSTER WE HAD TURNED BACK TO FOLLOW HER HAVING ENCOUNTERED HER COMING TOWARDS US AND WESTMINSTER ABBEY WAS THE POINT AT WHICH SHE PASSED FROM THE LIGHTS AND NOISE OF THE LEADING STREETS SHE PROCEEDED SO QUICKLY WHEN SHE GOT FREE OF THE TWO CURRENTS OF PASSENGERS SETTING TOWARDS AND FROM THE BRIDGE THAT BETWEEN THIS AND THE ADVANCE SHE HAD OF US WHEN SHE STRUCK OFF WE WERE IN THE NARROW WATERSIDE STREET BY MILLBANK BEFORE WE CAME UP WITH HER AT THAT MOMENT SHE CROSSED THE ROAD AS IF TO AVOID THE FOOTSTEPS THAT SHE HEARD SO CLOSE BEHIND AND WITHOUT LOOKING BACK PASSED ON EVEN MORE RAPIDLY A GLIMPSE OF THE RIVER THROUGH A DULL GATEWAY WHERE SOME WAGGONS WERE HOUSED FOR THE NIGHT SEEMED TO ARREST MY FEET I TOUCHED MY COMPANION WITHOUT SPEAKING AND WE BOTH FORBORE TO CROSS AFTER HER AND BOTH FOLLOWED ON THAT OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY KEEPING AS QUIETLY AS WE COULD IN THE SHADOW OF THE HOUSES BUT KEEPING VERY NEAR HER THERE WAS AND IS WHEN I WRITE AT THE END OF THAT LOWLYING STREET A DILAPIDATED LITTLE WOODEN BUILDING PROBABLY AN OBSOLETE OLD FERRYHOUSE ITS POSITION IS JUST AT THAT POINT WHERE THE STREET CEASES AND THE ROAD BEGINS TO LIE BETWEEN A ROW OF HOUSES AND THE RIVER AS SOON AS SHE CAME HERE AND SAW THE WATER SHE STOPPED AS IF SHE HAD COME TO HER DESTINATION AND PRESENTLY WENT SLOWLY ALONG BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER LOOKING INTENTLY AT IT ALL THE WAY HERE I HAD SUPPOSED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO SOME HOUSE INDEED I HAD VAGUELY ENTERTAINED THE HOPE THAT THE HOUSE MIGHT BE IN SOME WAY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOST GIRL BUT THAT ONE DARK GLIMPSE OF THE RIVER THROUGH THE GATEWAY HAD INSTINCTIVELY PREPARED ME FOR HER GOING NO FARTHER THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS A DREARY ONE AT THAT TIME AS OPPRESSIVE SAD AND SOLITARY BY NIGHT AS ANY ABOUT LONDON THERE WERE NEITHER WHARVES NOR HOUSES ON THE MELANCHOLY WASTE OF ROAD NEAR THE GREAT BLANK PRISON A SLUGGISH DITCH DEPOSITED ITS MUD AT THE PRISON WALLS COARSE GRASS AND RANK WEEDS STRAGGLED OVER ALL THE MARSHY LAND IN THE VICINITY IN ONE PART CARCASES OF HOUSES INAUSPICIOUSLY BEGUN AND NEVER FINISHED ROTTED AWAY IN ANOTHER THE GROUND WAS CUMBERED WITH RUSTY IRON MONSTERS OF STEAMBOILERS WHEELS CRANKS PIPES FURNACES PADDLES ANCHORS DIVINGBELLS WINDMILLSAILS AND I KNOW NOT WHAT STRANGE OBJECTS ACCUMULATED BY SOME SPECULATOR AND GROVELLING IN THE DUST UNDERNEATH WHICHHAVING SUNK INTO THE SOIL OF THEIR OWN WEIGHT IN WET WEATHERTHEY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF VAINLY TRYING TO HIDE THEMSELVES THE CLASH AND GLARE OF SUNDRY FIERY WORKS UPON THE RIVERSIDE AROSE BY NIGHT TO DISTURB EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE HEAVY AND UNBROKEN SMOKE THAT POURED OUT OF THEIR CHIMNEYS SLIMY GAPS AND CAUSEWAYS WINDING AMONG OLD WOODEN PILES WITH A SICKLY SUBSTANCE CLINGING TO THE LATTER LIKE GREEN HAIR AND THE RAGS OF LAST YEARS HANDBILLS OFFERING REWARDS FOR DROWNED MEN FLUTTERING ABOVE HIGHWATER MARK LED DOWN THROUGH THE OOZE AND SLUSH TO THE EBBTIDE THERE WAS A STORY THAT ONE OF THE PITS DUG FOR THE DEAD IN THE TIME OF THE GREAT PLAGUE WAS HEREABOUT AND A BLIGHTING INFLUENCE SEEMED TO HAVE PROCEEDED FROM IT OVER THE WHOLE PLACE OR ELSE IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD GRADUALLY DECOMPOSED INTO THAT NIGHTMARE CONDITION OUT OF THE OVERFLOWINGS OF THE POLLUTED STREAM AS IF SHE WERE A PART OF THE REFUSE IT HAD CAST OUT AND LEFT TO CORRUPTION AND DECAY THE GIRL WE HAD FOLLOWED STRAYED DOWN TO THE RIVERS BRINK AND STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THIS NIGHTPICTURE LONELY AND STILL LOOKING AT THE WATER THERE WERE SOME BOATS AND BARGES ASTRAND IN THE MUD AND THESE ENABLED US TO COME WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF HER WITHOUT BEING SEEN I THEN SIGNED TO MR PEGGOTTY TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS AND EMERGED FROM THEIR SHADE TO SPEAK TO HER I DID NOT APPROACH HER SOLITARY FIGURE WITHOUT TREMBLING FOR THIS GLOOMY END TO HER DETERMINED WALK AND THE WAY IN WHICH SHE STOOD ALMOST WITHIN THE CAVERNOUS SHADOW OF THE IRON BRIDGE LOOKING AT THE LIGHTS CROOKEDLY REFLECTED IN THE STRONG TIDE INSPIRED A DREAD WITHIN ME I THINK SHE WAS TALKING TO HERSELF I AM SURE ALTHOUGH ABSORBED IN GAZING AT THE WATER THAT HER SHAWL WAS OFF HER SHOULDERS AND THAT SHE WAS MUFFLING HER HANDS IN IT IN AN UNSETTLED AND BEWILDERED WAY MORE LIKE THE ACTION OF A SLEEPWALKER THAN A WAKING PERSON I KNOW AND NEVER CAN FORGET THAT THERE WAS THAT IN HER WILD MANNER WHICH GAVE ME NO ASSURANCE BUT THAT SHE WOULD SINK BEFORE MY EYES UNTIL I HAD HER ARM WITHIN MY GRASP AT THE SAME MOMENT I SAID MARTHA SHE UTTERED A TERRIFIED SCREAM AND STRUGGLED WITH ME WITH SUCH STRENGTH THAT I DOUBT IF I COULD HAVE HELD HER ALONE BUT A STRONGER HAND THAN MINE WAS LAID UPON HER AND WHEN SHE RAISED HER FRIGHTENED EYES AND SAW WHOSE IT WAS SHE MADE BUT ONE MORE EFFORT AND DROPPED DOWN BETWEEN US WE CARRIED HER AWAY FROM THE WATER TO WHERE THERE WERE SOME DRY STONES AND THERE LAID HER DOWN CRYING AND MOANING IN A LITTLE WHILE SHE SAT AMONG THE STONES HOLDING HER WRETCHED HEAD WITH BOTH HER HANDS OH THE RIVER SHE CRIED PASSIONATELY OH THE RIVER HUSH HUSH SAID I CALM YOURSELF BUT SHE STILL REPEATED THE SAME WORDS CONTINUALLY EXCLAIMING OH THE RIVER OVER AND OVER AGAIN I KNOW ITS LIKE ME SHE EXCLAIMED I KNOW THAT I BELONG TO IT I KNOW THAT ITS THE NATURAL COMPANY OF SUCH AS I AM IT COMES FROM COUNTRY PLACES WHERE THERE WAS ONCE NO HARM IN ITAND IT CREEPS THROUGH THE DISMAL STREETS DEFILED AND MISERABLEAND IT GOES AWAY LIKE MY LIFE TO A GREAT SEA THAT IS ALWAYS TROUBLEDAND I FEEL THAT I MUST GO WITH IT I HAVE NEVER KNOWN WHAT DESPAIR WAS EXCEPT IN THE TONE OF THOSE WORDS I CANT KEEP AWAY FROM IT I CANT FORGET IT IT HAUNTS ME DAY AND NIGHT ITS THE ONLY THING IN ALL THE WORLD THAT I AM FIT FOR OR THATS FIT FOR ME OH THE DREADFUL RIVER THE THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH MY MIND THAT IN THE FACE OF MY COMPANION AS HE LOOKED UPON HER WITHOUT SPEECH OR MOTION I MIGHT HAVE READ HIS NIECES HISTORY IF I HAD KNOWN NOTHING OF IT I NEVER SAW IN ANY PAINTING OR REALITY HORROR AND COMPASSION SO IMPRESSIVELY BLENDED HE SHOOK AS IF HE WOULD HAVE FALLEN AND HIS HANDI TOUCHED IT WITH MY OWN FOR HIS APPEARANCE ALARMED MEWAS DEADLY COLD SHE IS IN A STATE OF FRENZY I WHISPERED TO HIM SHE WILL SPEAK DIFFERENTLY IN A LITTLE TIME I DONT KNOW WHAT HE WOULD HAVE SAID IN ANSWER HE MADE SOME MOTION WITH HIS MOUTH AND SEEMED TO THINK HE HAD SPOKEN BUT HE HAD ONLY POINTED TO HER WITH HIS OUTSTRETCHED HAND A NEW BURST OF CRYING CAME UPON HER NOW IN WHICH SHE ONCE MORE HID HER FACE AMONG THE STONES AND LAY BEFORE US A PROSTRATE IMAGE OF HUMILIATION AND RUIN KNOWING THAT THIS STATE MUST PASS BEFORE WE COULD SPEAK TO HER WITH ANY HOPE I VENTURED TO RESTRAIN HIM WHEN HE WOULD HAVE RAISED HER AND WE STOOD BY IN SILENCE UNTIL SHE BECAME MORE TRANQUIL MARTHA SAID I THEN LEANING DOWN AND HELPING HER TO RISESHE SEEMED TO WANT TO RISE AS IF WITH THE INTENTION OF GOING AWAY BUT SHE WAS WEAK AND LEANED AGAINST A BOAT DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS WHO IS WITH ME SHE SAID FAINTLY YES DO YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE FOLLOWED YOU A LONG WAY TONIGHT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD SHE LOOKED NEITHER AT HIM NOR AT ME BUT STOOD IN A HUMBLE ATTITUDE HOLDING HER BONNET AND SHAWL IN ONE HAND WITHOUT APPEARING CONSCIOUS OF THEM AND PRESSING THE OTHER CLENCHED AGAINST HER FOREHEAD ARE YOU COMPOSED ENOUGH SAID I TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT WHICH SO INTERESTED YOUI HOPE HEAVEN MAY REMEMBER ITTHAT SNOWY NIGHT HER SOBS BROKE OUT AFRESH AND SHE MURMURED SOME INARTICULATE THANKS TO ME FOR NOT HAVING DRIVEN HER AWAY FROM THE DOOR I WANT TO SAY NOTHING FOR MYSELF SHE SAID AFTER A FEW MOMENTS I AM BAD I AM LOST I HAVE NO HOPE AT ALL BUT TELL HIM SIR SHE HAD SHRUNK AWAY FROM HIM IF YOU DONT FEEL TOO HARD TO ME TO DO IT THAT I NEVER WAS IN ANY WAY THE CAUSE OF HIS MISFORTUNE IT HAS NEVER BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO YOU I RETURNED EARNESTLY RESPONDING TO HER EARNESTNESS IT WAS YOU IF I DONT DECEIVE MYSELF SHE SAID IN A BROKEN VOICE THAT CAME INTO THE KITCHEN THE NIGHT SHE TOOK SUCH PITY ON ME WAS SO GENTLE TO ME DIDNT SHRINK AWAY FROM ME LIKE ALL THE REST AND GAVE ME SUCH KIND HELP WAS IT YOU SIR IT WAS SAID I I SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE RIVER LONG AGO SHE SAID GLANCING AT IT WITH A TERRIBLE EXPRESSION IF ANY WRONG TO HER HAD BEEN UPON MY MIND I NEVER COULD HAVE KEPT OUT OF IT A SINGLE WINTERS NIGHT IF I HAD NOT BEEN FREE OF ANY SHARE IN THAT THE CAUSE OF HER FLIGHT IS TOO WELL UNDERSTOOD I SAID YOU ARE INNOCENT OF ANY PART IN IT WE THOROUGHLY BELIEVEWE KNOW OH I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MUCH THE BETTER FOR HER IF I HAD HAD A BETTER HEART EXCLAIMED THE GIRL WITH MOST FORLORN REGRET FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS GOOD TO ME SHE NEVER SPOKE A WORD TO ME BUT WHAT WAS PLEASANT AND RIGHT IS IT LIKELY I WOULD TRY TO MAKE HER WHAT I AM MYSELF KNOWING WHAT I AM MYSELF SO WELL WHEN I LOST EVERYTHING THAT MAKES LIFE DEAR THE WORST OF ALL MY THOUGHTS WAS THAT I WAS PARTED FOR EVER FROM HER MR PEGGOTTY STANDING WITH ONE HAND ON THE GUNWALE OF THE BOAT AND HIS EYES CAST DOWN PUT HIS DISENGAGED HAND BEFORE HIS FACE AND WHEN I HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE THAT SNOWY NIGHT FROM SOME BELONGING TO OUR TOWN CRIED MARTHA THE BITTEREST THOUGHT IN ALL MY MIND WAS THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD REMEMBER SHE ONCE KEPT COMPANY WITH ME AND WOULD SAY I HAD CORRUPTED HER WHEN HEAVEN KNOWS I WOULD HAVE DIED TO HAVE BROUGHT BACK HER GOOD NAME LONG UNUSED TO ANY SELFCONTROL THE PIERCING AGONY OF HER REMORSE AND GRIEF WAS TERRIBLE TO HAVE DIED WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCHWHAT CAN I SAYI WOULD HAVE LIVED SHE CRIED I WOULD HAVE LIVED TO BE OLD IN THE WRETCHED STREETSAND TO WANDER ABOUT AVOIDED IN THE DARKAND TO SEE THE DAY BREAK ON THE GHASTLY LINE OF HOUSES AND REMEMBER HOW THE SAME SUN USED TO SHINE INTO MY ROOM AND WAKE ME ONCEI WOULD HAVE DONE EVEN THAT TO SAVE HER SINKING ON THE STONES SHE TOOK SOME IN EACH HAND AND CLENCHED THEM UP AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE GROUND THEM SHE WRITHED INTO SOME NEW POSTURE CONSTANTLY STIFFENING HER ARMS TWISTING THEM BEFORE HER FACE AS THOUGH TO SHUT OUT FROM HER EYES THE LITTLE LIGHT THERE WAS AND DROOPING HER HEAD AS IF IT WERE HEAVY WITH INSUPPORTABLE RECOLLECTIONS WHAT SHALL I EVER DO SHE SAID FIGHTING THUS WITH HER DESPAIR HOW CAN I GO ON AS I AM A SOLITARY CURSE TO MYSELF A LIVING DISGRACE TO EVERYONE I COME NEAR SUDDENLY SHE TURNED TO MY COMPANION STAMP UPON ME KILL ME WHEN SHE WAS YOUR PRIDE YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I HAD DONE HER HARM IF I HAD BRUSHED AGAINST HER IN THE STREET YOU CANT BELIEVEWHY

KNOWLEDGE COME TO YOU AND BRING YOU TO HER SHE ASKED HURRIEDLY WE BOTH REPLIED TOGETHER YES SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND SOLEMNLY DECLARED THAT SHE WOULD DEVOTE HERSELF TO THIS TASK FERVENTLY AND FAITHFULLY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER WAVER IN IT NEVER BE DIVERTED FROM IT NEVER RELINQUISH IT WHILE THERE WAS ANY CHANCE OF HOPE IF SHE WERE NOT TRUE TO IT MIGHT THE OBJECT SHE NOW HAD IN LIFE WHICH BOUND HER TO SOMETHING DEVOID OF EVIL IN ITS PASSING AWAY FROM HER LEAVE HER MORE FORLORN AND MORE DESPAIRING IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE THAN SHE HAD BEEN UPON THE RIVERS BRINK THAT NIGHT AND THEN MIGHT ALL HELP HUMAN AND DIVINE RENOUNCE HER EVERMORE SHE DID NOT RAISE HER VOICE ABOVE HER BREATH OR ADDRESS US BUT SAID THIS TO THE NIGHT SKY THEN STOOD PROFOUNDLY QUIET LOOKING AT THE GLOOMY WATER WE JUDGED IT EXPEDIENT NOW TO TELL HER ALL WE KNEW WHICH I RECOUNTED AT LENGTH SHE LISTENED WITH GREAT ATTENTION AND WITH A FACE THAT OFTEN CHANGED BUT HAD THE SAME PURPOSE IN ALL ITS VARYING EXPRESSIONS HER EYES OCCASIONALLY FILLED WITH TEARS BUT THOSE SHE REPRESSED IT SEEMED AS IF HER SPIRIT WERE QUITE ALTERED AND SHE COULD NOT BE TOO QUIET SHE ASKED WHEN ALL WAS TOLD WHERE WE WERE TO BE COMMUNICATED WITH IF OCCASION SHOULD ARISE UNDER A DULL LAMP IN THE ROAD I WROTE OUR TWO ADDRESSES ON A LEAF OF MY POCKETBOOK WHICH I TORE OUT AND GAVE TO HER AND WHICH SHE PUT IN HER POOR BOSOM I ASKED HER WHERE SHE LIVED HERSELF SHE SAID AFTER A PAUSE IN NO PLACE LONG IT WERE BETTER NOT TO KNOW MR PEGGOTTY SUGGESTING TO ME IN A WHISPER WHAT HAD ALREADY OCCURRED TO MYSELF I TOOK OUT MY PURSE BUT I COULD NOT PREVAIL UPON HER TO ACCEPT ANY MONEY NOR COULD I EXACT ANY PROMISE FROM HER THAT SHE WOULD DO SO AT ANOTHER TIME I REPRESENTED TO HER THAT MR PEGGOTTY COULD NOT BE CALLED FOR ONE IN HIS CONDITION POOR AND THAT THE IDEA OF HER ENGAGING IN THIS SEARCH WHILE DEPENDING ON HER OWN RESOURCES SHOCKED US BOTH SHE CONTINUED STEADFAST IN THIS PARTICULAR HIS INFLUENCE UPON HER WAS EQUALLY POWERLESS WITH MINE SHE GRATEFULLY THANKED HIM BUT REMAINED INEXORABLE THERE MAY BE WORK TO BE GOT SHE SAID ILL TRY AT LEAST TAKE SOME ASSISTANCE I RETURNED UNTIL YOU HAVE TRIED I COULD NOT DO WHAT I HAVE PROMISED FOR MONEY SHE REPLIED I COULD NOT TAKE IT IF I WAS STARVING TO GIVE ME MONEY WOULD BE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR TRUST TO TAKE AWAY THE OBJECT THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME TO TAKE AWAY THE ONLY CERTAIN THING THAT SAVES ME FROM THE RIVER IN THE NAME OF THE GREAT JUDGE SAID I BEFORE WHOM YOU AND ALL OF US MUST STAND AT HIS DREAD TIME DISMISS THAT TERRIBLE IDEA WE CAN ALL DO SOME GOOD IF WE WILL SHE TREMBLED AND HER LIP SHOOK AND HER FACE WAS PALER AS SHE ANSWERED IT HAS BEEN PUT INTO YOUR HEARTS PERHAPS TO SAVE A WRETCHED CREATURE FOR REPENTANCE I AM AFRAID TO THINK SO IT SEEMS TOO BOLD IF ANY GOOD SHOULD COME OF ME I MIGHT BEGIN TO HOPE FOR NOTHING BUT HARM HAS EVER COME OF MY DEEDS YET I AM TO BE TRUSTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG WHILE WITH MY MISERABLE LIFE ON ACCOUNT OF WHAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME TO TRY FOR I KNOW NO MORE AND I CAN SAY NO MORE AGAIN SHE REPRESSED THE TEARS THAT HAD BEGUN TO FLOW AND PUTTING OUT HER TREMBLING HAND AND TOUCHING MR PEGGOTTY AS IF THERE WAS SOME HEALING VIRTUE IN HIM WENT AWAY ALONG THE DESOLATE ROAD SHE HAD BEEN ILL PROBABLY FOR A LONG TIME I OBSERVED UPON THAT CLOSER OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVATION THAT SHE WAS WORN AND HAGGARD AND THAT HER SUNKEN EYES EXPRESSED PRIVATION AND ENDURANCE WE FOLLOWED HER AT A SHORT DISTANCE OUR WAY LYING IN THE SAME DIRECTION UNTIL WE CAME BACK INTO THE LIGHTED AND POPULOUS STREETS I HAD SUCH IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE IN HER DECLARATION THAT I THEN PUT IT TO MR PEGGOTTY WHETHER IT WOULD NOT SEEM IN THE ONSET LIKE DISTRUSTING HER TO FOLLOW HER ANY FARTHER HE BEING OF THE SAME MIND AND EQUALLY RELIANT ON HER WE SUFFERED HER TO TAKE HER OWN ROAD AND TOOK OURS WHICH WAS TOWARDS HIGHGATE HE ACCOMPANIED ME A GOOD PART OF THE WAY AND WHEN WE PARTED WITH A PRAYER FOR THE SUCCESS OF THIS FRESH EFFORT THERE WAS A NEW AND THOUGHTFUL COMPASSION IN HIM THAT I WAS AT NO LOSS TO INTERPRET IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN I ARRIVED AT HOME I HAD REACHED MY OWN GATE AND WAS STANDING LISTENING FOR THE DEEP BELL OF ST PAULS THE SOUND OF WHICH I THOUGHT HAD BEEN BORNE TOWARDS ME AMONG THE MULTITUDE OF STRIKING CLOCKS WHEN I WAS RATHER SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THE DOOR OF MY AUNTS COTTAGE WAS OPEN AND THAT A FAINT LIGHT IN THE ENTRY WAS SHINING OUT ACROSS THE ROAD THINKING THAT MY AUNT MIGHT HAVE RELAPSED INTO ONE OF HER OLD ALARMS AND MIGHT BE WATCHING THE PROGRESS OF SOME IMAGINARY CONFLAGRATION IN THE DISTANCE I WENT TO SPEAK TO HER IT WAS WITH VERY GREAT SURPRISE THAT I SAW A MAN STANDING IN HER LITTLE GARDEN HE HAD A GLASS AND BOTTLE IN HIS HAND AND WAS IN THE ACT OF DRINKING I STOPPED SHORT AMONG THE THICK FOLIAGE OUTSIDE FOR THE MOON WAS UP NOW THOUGH OBSCURED AND I RECOGNIZED THE MAN WHOM I HAD ONCE SUPPOSED TO BE A DELUSION OF MR DICKS AND HAD ONCE ENCOUNTERED WITH MY AUNT IN THE STREETS OF THE CITY HE WAS EATING AS WELL AS DRINKING AND SEEMED TO EAT WITH A HUNGRY APPETITE HE SEEMED CURIOUS REGARDING THE COTTAGE TOO AS IF IT WERE THE FIRST TIME HE HAD SEEN IT AFTER STOOPING TO PUT THE BOTTLE ON THE GROUND HE LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS AND LOOKED ABOUT THOUGH WITH A COVERT AND IMPATIENT AIR AS IF HE WAS ANXIOUS TO BE GONE THE LIGHT IN THE PASSAGE WAS OBSCURED FOR A MOMENT AND MY AUNT CAME OUT SHE WAS AGITATED AND TOLD SOME MONEY INTO HIS HAND I HEARD IT CHINK WHATS THE USE OF THIS HE DEMANDED I CAN SPARE NO MORE RETURNED MY AUNT THEN I CANT GO SAID HE HERE YOU MAY TAKE IT BACK YOU BAD MAN RETURNED MY AUNT WITH GREAT EMOTION HOW CAN YOU USE ME SO BUT WHY DO I ASK IT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW WEAK I AM WHAT HAVE I TO DO TO FREE MYSELF FOR EVER OF YOUR VISITS BUT TO ABANDON YOU TO YOUR DESERTS AND WHY DONT YOU ABANDON ME TO MY DESERTS SAID HE YOU ASK ME WHY RETURNED MY AUNT WHAT A HEART YOU MUST HAVE HE STOOD MOODILY RATTLING THE MONEY AND SHAKING HIS HEAD UNTIL AT LENGTH HE SAID IS THIS ALL YOU MEAN TO GIVE ME THEN IT IS ALL I CAN GIVE YOU SAID MY AUNT YOU KNOW I HAVE HAD LOSSES AND AM POORER THAN I USED TO BE I HAVE TOLD YOU SO HAVING GOT IT WHY DO YOU GIVE ME THE PAIN OF LOOKING AT YOU FOR ANOTHER MOMENT AND SEEING WHAT YOU HAVE BECOME I HAVE BECOME SHABBY ENOUGH IF YOU MEAN THAT HE SAID I LEAD THE LIFE OF AN OWL YOU STRIPPED ME OF THE GREATER PART OF ALL I EVER HAD SAID MY AUNT YOU CLOSED MY HEART AGAINST THE WHOLE WORLD YEARS AND YEARS YOU TREATED ME FALSELY UNGRATEFULLY AND CRUELLY GO AND REPENT OF IT DONT ADD NEW INJURIES TO THE LONG LONG LIST OF INJURIES YOU HAVE DONE ME AYE HE RETURNED ITS ALL VERY FINEWELL I MUST DO THE BEST I CAN FOR THE PRESENT I SUPPOSE IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE APPEARED ABASHED BY MY AUNTS INDIGNANT TEARS AND CAME SLOUCHING OUT OF THE GARDEN TAKING TWO OR THREE QUICK STEPS AS IF I HAD JUST COME UP I MET HIM AT THE GATE AND WENT IN AS HE CAME OUT WE EYED ONE ANOTHER NARROWLY IN PASSING AND WITH NO FAVOUR AUNT SAID I HURRIEDLY THIS MAN ALARMING YOU AGAIN LET ME SPEAK TO HIM WHO IS HE CHILD RETURNED MY AUNT TAKING MY ARM COME IN AND DONT SPEAK TO ME FOR TEN MINUTES WE SAT DOWN IN HER LITTLE PARLOUR MY AUNT RETIRED BEHIND THE ROUND GREEN FAN OF FORMER DAYS WHICH WAS SCREWED ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR AND OCCASIONALLY WIPED HER EYES FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR THEN SHE CAME OUT AND TOOK A SEAT BESIDE ME TROT SAID MY AUNT CALMLY ITS MY HUSBAND YOUR HUSBAND AUNT I THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN DEAD DEAD TO ME RETURNED MY AUNT BUT LIVING I SAT IN SILENT AMAZEMENT BETSEY TROTWOOD DONT LOOK A LIKELY SUBJECT FOR THE TENDER PASSION SAID MY AUNT COMPOSEDLY BUT THE TIME WAS TROT WHEN SHE BELIEVED IN THAT MAN MOST ENTIRELY WHEN SHE LOVED HIM TROT RIGHT WELL WHEN THERE WAS NO PROOF OF ATTACHMENT AND AFFECTION THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HIM HE REPAID HER BY BREAKING HER FORTUNE AND NEARLY BREAKING HER HEART SO SHE PUT ALL THAT SORT OF SENTIMENT ONCE AND FOR EVER IN A GRAVE AND FILLED IT UP AND FLATTENED IT DOWN MY DEAR GOOD AUNT I LEFT HIM MY AUNT PROCEEDED LAYING HER HAND AS USUAL ON THE BACK OF MINE GENEROUSLY I MAY SAY AT THIS DISTANCE OF TIME TROT THAT I LEFT HIM GENEROUSLY HE HAD BEEN SO CRUEL TO ME THAT I MIGHT HAVE EFFECTED A SEPARATION ON EASY TERMS FOR MYSELF BUT I DID NOT HE SOON MADE DUCKS AND DRAKES OF WHAT I GAVE HIM SANK LOWER AND LOWER MARRIED ANOTHER WOMAN I BELIEVE BECAME AN ADVENTURER A GAMBLER AND A CHEAT WHAT HE IS NOW YOU SEE BUT HE WAS A FINELOOKING MAN WHEN I MARRIED HIM SAID MY AUNT WITH AN ECHO OF HER OLD PRIDE AND ADMIRATION IN HER TONE AND I BELIEVED HIMI WAS A FOOLTO BE THE SOUL OF HONOUR SHE GAVE MY HAND A SQUEEZE AND SHOOK HER HEAD HE IS NOTHING TO ME NOW TROTLESS THAN NOTHING BUT SOONER THAN HAVE HIM PUNISHED FOR HIS OFFENCES AS HE WOULD BE IF HE PROWLED ABOUT IN THIS COUNTRY I GIVE HIM MORE MONEY THAN I CAN AFFORD AT INTERVALS WHEN HE REAPPEARS TO GO AWAY I WAS A FOOL WHEN I MARRIED HIM AND I AM SO FAR AN INCURABLE FOOL ON THAT SUBJECT THAT FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT I ONCE BELIEVED HIM TO BE I WOULDNT HAVE EVEN THIS SHADOW OF MY IDLE FANCY HARDLY DEALT WITH FOR I WAS IN EARNEST TROT IF EVER A WOMAN WAS MY AUNT DISMISSED THE MATTER WITH A HEAVY SIGH AND SMOOTHED HER DRESS THERE MY DEAR SHE SAID NOW YOU KNOW THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END AND ALL ABOUT IT WE WONT MENTION THE SUBJECT TO ONE ANOTHER ANY MORE NEITHER OF COURSE WILL YOU MENTION IT TO ANYBODY ELSE THIS IS MY GRUMPY FRUMPY STORY AND WELL KEEP IT TO OURSELVES TROT CHAPTER DOMESTIC I LABOURED HARD AT MY BOOK WITHOUT ALLOWING IT TO INTERFERE WITH THE PUNCTUAL DISCHARGE OF MY NEWSPAPER DUTIES AND IT CAME OUT AND WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL I WAS NOT STUNNED BY THE PRAISE WHICH SOUNDED IN MY EARS NOTWITHSTANDING THAT I WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO IT AND THOUGHT BETTER OF MY OWN PERFORMANCE I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAN ANYBODY ELSE DID IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN MY OBSERVATION OF HUMAN NATURE THAT A MAN WHO HAS ANY GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE IN HIMSELF NEVER FLOURISHES HIMSELF BEFORE THE FACES OF OTHER PEOPLE IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY BELIEVE IN HIM FOR THIS REASON I RETAINED MY MODESTY IN VERY SELFRESPECT AND THE MORE PRAISE I GOT THE MORE I TRIED TO DESERVE IT IS NOT MY PURPOSE IN THIS RECORD THOUGH IN ALL OTHER ESSENTIALS IT IS MY WRITTEN MEMORY TO PURSUE THE HISTORY OF MY OWN FICTIONS THEY EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND I LEAVE THEM TO THEMSELVES WHEN I REFER TO THEM INCIDENTALLY IT IS ONLY AS A PART OF MY PROGRESS HAVING SOME FOUNDATION FOR BELIEVING BY THIS TIME THAT NATURE AND ACCIDENT HAD MADE ME AN AUTHOR I PURSUED MY VOCATION WITH CONFIDENCE WITHOUT SUCH ASSURANCE I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE LEFT IT ALONE AND BESTOWED MY ENERGY ON SOME OTHER ENDEAVOUR I SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO FIND OUT WHAT NATURE AND ACCIDENT REALLY HAD MADE ME AND TO BE THAT AND NOTHING ELSE I HAD BEEN WRITING IN THE NEWSPAPER AND ELSEWHERE SO PROSPEROUSLY THAT WHEN MY NEW SUCCESS WAS ACHIEVED I CONSIDERED MYSELF REASONABLY ENTITLED TO ESCAPE FROM THE DREARY DEBATES ONE JOYFUL NIGHT THEREFORE I NOTED DOWN THE MUSIC OF THE PARLIAMENTARY BAGPIPES FOR THE LAST TIME AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD IT SINCE THOUGH I STILL RECOGNIZE THE OLD DRONE IN THE NEWSPAPERS WITHOUT ANY SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION EXCEPT PERHAPS THAT THERE IS MORE OF IT ALL THE LIVELONG SESSION I NOW WRITE OF THE TIME WHEN I HAD BEEN MARRIED I SUPPOSE ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER SEVERAL VARIETIES OF EXPERIMENT WE HAD GIVEN UP THE HOUSEKEEPING AS A BAD JOB THE HOUSE KEPT ITSELF AND WE KEPT A PAGE THE PRINCIPAL FUNCTION OF THIS RETAINER WAS TO QUARREL WITH THE COOK IN WHICH RESPECT HE WAS A PERFECT WHITTINGTON WITHOUT HIS CAT OR THE REMOTEST CHANCE OF BEING MADE LORD MAYOR HE APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE LIVED IN A HAIL OF SAUCEPANLIDS HIS WHOLE EXISTENCE WAS A SCUFFLE HE WOULD SHRIEK FOR HELP ON THE MOST IMPROPER OCCASIONSAS WHEN WE HAD A LITTLE DINNERPARTY OR A FEW FRIENDS IN THE EVENINGAND WOULD COME TUMBLING OUT OF THE KITCHEN WITH IRON MISSILES FLYING AFTER HIM WE WANTED TO GET RID OF HIM BUT HE WAS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO US AND WOULDNT GO HE WAS A TEARFUL BOY AND BROKE INTO SUCH DEPLORABLE LAMENTATIONS WHEN A CESSATION OF OUR CONNEXION WAS HINTED AT THAT WE WERE OBLIGED TO KEEP HIM HE HAD NO MOTHERNO ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF A RELATIVE THAT I COULD DISCOVER EXCEPT A SISTER WHO FLED TO AMERICA THE MOMENT WE HAD TAKEN HIM OFF HER HANDS AND HE BECAME QUARTERED ON US LIKE A HORRIBLE YOUNG CHANGELING HE HAD A LIVELY PERCEPTION OF HIS OWN UNFORTUNATE STATE AND WAS ALWAYS RUBBING HIS EYES WITH THE SLEEVE OF HIS JACKET OR STOOPING TO BLOW HIS NOSE ON THE EXTREME CORNER OF A LITTLE POCKETHANDKERCHIEF WHICH HE NEVER WOULD TAKE COMPLETELY OUT OF HIS POCKET BUT ALWAYS ECONOMIZED AND SECRETED THIS UNLUCKY PAGE ENGAGED IN AN EVIL HOUR AT SIX POUNDS TEN PER ANNUM WAS A SOURCE OF CONTINUAL TROUBLE TO ME I WATCHED HIM AS HE GREWAND HE GREW LIKE SCARLET BEANSWITH PAINFUL APPREHENSIONS OF THE TIME WHEN HE WOULD BEGIN TO SHAVE EVEN OF THE DAYS WHEN HE WOULD BE BALD OR GREY I SAW NO PROSPECT OF EVER GETTING RID OF HIM AND PROJECTING MYSELF INTO THE FUTURE USED TO THINK WHAT AN INCONVENIENCE HE WOULD BE WHEN HE WAS AN OLD MAN I NEVER EXPECTED ANYTHING LESS THAN THIS UNFORTUNATES MANNER OF GETTING ME OUT OF MY DIFFICULTY HE STOLE DORAS WATCH WHICH LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE BELONGING TO US HAD NO PARTICULAR PLACE OF ITS OWN AND CONVERTING IT INTO MONEY SPENT THE PRODUCE HE WAS ALWAYS A WEAKMINDED BOY IN INCESSANTLY RIDING UP AND DOWN BETWEEN LONDON AND UXBRIDGE OUTSIDE THE COACH HE WAS TAKEN TO BOW STREET AS WELL AS I REMEMBER ON THE COMPLETION OF HIS FIFTEENTH JOURNEY WHEN FOURANDSIXPENCE AND A SECONDHAND FIFE WHICH HE COULDNT PLAY WERE FOUND UPON HIS PERSON THE SURPRISE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS DISAGREEABLE TO ME IF HE HAD NOT BEEN PENITENT BUT HE WAS VERY PENITENT INDEED AND IN A PECULIAR WAYNOT IN THE LUMP BUT BY INSTALMENTS FOR EXAMPLE THE DAY AFTER THAT ON WHICH I WAS OBLIGED TO APPEAR AGAINST HIM HE MADE CERTAIN REVELATIONS TOUCHING A HAMPER IN THE CELLAR WHICH WE BELIEVED TO BE FULL OF WINE BUT WHICH HAD NOTHING IN IT EXCEPT BOTTLES AND CORKS WE SUPPOSED HE HAD NOW EASED HIS MIND AND TOLD THE WORST HE KNEW OF THE COOK BUT A DAY OR TWO AFTERWARDS HIS CONSCIENCE SUSTAINED A NEW TWINGE AND HE DISCLOSED HOW SHE HAD A LITTLE GIRL WHO EARLY EVERY MORNING TOOK AWAY OUR BREAD AND ALSO HOW HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN SUBORNED TO MAINTAIN THE MILKMAN IN COALS IN TWO OR THREE DAYS MORE I WAS INFORMED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF HIS HAVING LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF SIRLOINS OF BEEF AMONG THE KITCHENSTUFF AND SHEETS IN THE RAGBAG A LITTLE WHILE AFTERWARDS HE BROKE OUT IN AN ENTIRELY NEW DIRECTION AND CONFESSED TO A KNOWLEDGE OF BURGLARIOUS INTENTIONS AS TO OUR PREMISES ON THE PART OF THE POTBOY WHO WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP I GOT TO BE SO ASHAMED OF BEING SUCH A VICTIM THAT I WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM ANY MONEY TO HOLD HIS TONGUE OR WOULD HAVE OFFERED A ROUND BRIBE FOR HIS BEING PERMITTED TO RUN AWAY IT WAS AN AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE CASE THAT HE HAD NO IDEA OF THIS BUT CONCEIVED THAT HE WAS MAKING ME AMENDS IN EVERY NEW DISCOVERY NOT TO SAY HEAPING OBLIGATIONS ON MY HEAD AT LAST I RAN AWAY MYSELF WHENEVER I SAW AN EMISSARY OF THE POLICE APPROACHING WITH SOME NEW INTELLIGENCE AND LIVED A STEALTHY LIFE UNTIL HE WAS TRIED AND ORDERED TO BE TRANSPORTED EVEN THEN HE COULDNT BE QUIET BUT WAS ALWAYS WRITING US LETTERS AND WANTED SO MUCH TO SEE DORA BEFORE HE WENT AWAY THAT DORA WENT TO VISIT HIM AND FAINTED WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF INSIDE THE IRON BARS IN SHORT I HAD NO PEACE OF MY LIFE UNTIL HE WAS EXPATRIATED AND MADE AS I AFTERWARDS HEARD A SHEPHERD OF UP THE COUNTRY SOMEWHERE I HAVE NO GEOGRAPHICAL IDEA WHERE ALL THIS LED ME INTO SOME SERIOUS REFLECTIONS AND PRESENTED OUR MISTAKES IN A NEW ASPECT AS I COULD NOT HELP COMMUNICATING TO DORA ONE EVENING IN SPITE OF MY TENDERNESS FOR HER MY LOVE SAID I IT IS VERY PAINFUL TO ME TO THINK THAT OUR WANT OF SYSTEM AND MANAGEMENT INVOLVES NOT ONLY OURSELVES WHICH WE HAVE GOT USED TO BUT OTHER PEOPLE YOU HAVE BEEN SILENT FOR A LONG TIME AND NOW YOU ARE GOING TO BE CROSS SAID DORA NO MY DEAR INDEED LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT I MEAN I THINK I DONT WANT TO KNOW SAID DORA BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW MY LOVE PUT JIP DOWN DORA PUT HIS NOSE TO MINE AND SAID BOH TO DRIVE MY SERIOUSNESS AWAY BUT NOT SUCCEEDING ORDERED HIM INTO HIS PAGODA AND SAT LOOKING AT ME WITH HER HANDS FOLDED AND A MOST RESIGNED LITTLE EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE THE FACT IS MY DEAR I BEGAN THERE IS CONTAGION IN US WE INFECT EVERYONE ABOUT US I MIGHT HAVE GONE ON IN THIS FIGURATIVE MANNER IF DORAS FACE HAD NOT ADMONISHED ME THAT SHE WAS WONDERING WITH ALL HER MIGHT WHETHER I WAS GOING TO PROPOSE ANY NEW KIND OF VACCINATION OR OTHER MEDICAL REMEDY FOR THIS UNWHOLESOME STATE OF OURS THEREFORE I CHECKED MYSELF AND MADE MY MEANING PLAINER IT IS NOT MERELY MY PET SAID I THAT WE LOSE MONEY AND COMFORT AND EVEN TEMPER SOMETIMES BY NOT LEARNING TO BE MORE CAREFUL BUT THAT WE INCUR THE SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITY OF SPOILING EVERYONE WHO COMES INTO OUR SERVICE OR HAS ANY DEALINGS WITH US I BEGIN TO BE AFRAID THAT THE FAULT IS NOT ENTIRELY ON ONE SIDE BUT THAT THESE PEOPLE ALL TURN OUT ILL BECAUSE WE DONT TURN OUT VERY WELL OURSELVES OH WHAT AN ACCUSATION EXCLAIMED DORA OPENING HER EYES WIDE TO SAY THAT YOU EVER SAW ME TAKE GOLD WATCHES OH MY DEAREST I REMONSTRATED DONT TALK PREPOSTEROUS NONSENSE WHO HAS MADE THE LEAST ALLUSION TO GOLD WATCHES YOU DID RETURNED DORA YOU KNOW YOU DID YOU SAID I HADNT TURNED OUT WELL AND COMPARED ME TO HIM TO WHOM I ASKED TO THE PAGE SOBBED DORA OH YOU CRUEL FELLOW TO COMPARE YOUR AFFECTIONATE WIFE TO A TRANSPORTED PAGE WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF ME BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED WHY DIDNT YOU SAY YOU HARDHEARTED THING THAT YOU WERE CONVINCED I WAS WORSE THAN A TRANSPORTED PAGE OH WHAT A DREADFUL OPINION TO HAVE OF ME OH MY GOODNESS NOW DORA MY LOVE I RETURNED GENTLY TRYING TO REMOVE THE HANDKERCHIEF SHE PRESSED TO HER EYES THIS IS NOT ONLY VERY RIDICULOUS OF YOU BUT VERY WRONG IN THE FIRST PLACE ITS NOT TRUE YOU ALWAYS SAID HE WAS A STORYTELLER SOBBED DORA AND NOW YOU SAY THE SAME OF ME OH WHAT SHALL I DO WHAT SHALL I DO MY DARLING GIRL I RETORTED I REALLY MUST ENTREAT YOU TO BE REASONABLE AND LISTEN TO WHAT I DID SAY AND DO SAY MY DEAR DORA UNLESS WE LEARN TO DO OUR DUTY TO THOSE WHOM WE EMPLOY THEY WILL NEVER LEARN TO DO THEIR DUTY TO US I AM AFRAID WE PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES TO PEOPLE TO DO WRONG THAT NEVER OUGHT TO BE PRESENTED EVEN IF WE WERE AS LAX AS WE ARE IN ALL OUR ARRANGEMENTS BY CHOICEWHICH WE ARE NOTEVEN IF WE LIKED IT AND FOUND IT AGREEABLE TO BE SOWHICH WE DONTI AM PERSUADED WE SHOULD HAVE NO RIGHT TO GO ON IN THIS WAY WE ARE POSITIVELY CORRUPTING PEOPLE WE ARE BOUND TO THINK OF THAT I CANT HELP THINKING OF IT DORA IT IS A REFLECTION I AM UNABLE TO DISMISS AND IT SOMETIMES MAKES ME VERY UNEASY THERE DEAR THATS ALL COME NOW DONT BE FOOLISH DORA WOULD NOT ALLOW ME FOR A LONG TIME TO REMOVE THE HANDKERCHIEF SHE SAT SOBBING AND MURMURING BEHIND IT THAT IF I WAS UNEASY WHY HAD I EVER BEEN MARRIED WHY HADNT I SAID EVEN THE DAY BEFORE WE WENT TO CHURCH THAT I KNEW I SHOULD BE UNEASY AND I WOULD RATHER NOT IF I COULDNT BEAR HER WHY DIDNT I SEND HER AWAY TO HER AUNTS AT PUTNEY OR TO JULIA MILLS IN INDIA JULIA WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER AND WOULD NOT CALL HER A TRANSPORTED PAGE JULIA NEVER HAD CALLED HER ANYTHING OF THE SORT IN SHORT DORA WAS SO AFFLICTED AND SO AFFLICTED ME BY BEING IN THAT CONDITION THAT I FELT IT WAS OF NO USE REPEATING THIS KIND OF EFFORT THOUGH NEVER SO MILDLY AND I MUST TAKE SOME OTHER COURSE WHAT OTHER COURSE WAS LEFT TO TAKE TO FORM HER MIND THIS WAS A COMMON PHRASE OF WORDS WHICH HAD A FAIR AND PROMISING SOUND AND I RESOLVED TO FORM DORAS MIND I BEGAN IMMEDIATELY WHEN DORA WAS VERY CHILDISH AND I WOULD HAVE INFINITELY PREFERRED TO HUMOUR HER I TRIED TO BE GRAVEAND DISCONCERTED HER AND MYSELF TOO I TALKED TO HER ON THE SUBJECTS WHICH OCCUPIED MY THOUGHTS AND I READ SHAKESPEARE TO HERAND FATIGUED HER TO THE LAST DEGREE I ACCUSTOMED MYSELF TO GIVING HER AS IT WERE QUITE CASUALLY LITTLE SCRAPS OF USEFUL INFORMATION OR SOUND OPINIONAND SHE STARTED FROM THEM WHEN I LET THEM OFF AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CRACKERS NO MATTER HOW INCIDENTALLY OR NATURALLY I ENDEAVOURED TO FORM MY LITTLE WIFES MIND I COULD NOT HELP SEEING THAT SHE ALWAYS HAD AN INSTINCTIVE PERCEPTION OF WHAT I WAS ABOUT AND BECAME A PREY TO THE KEENEST APPREHENSIONS IN PARTICULAR IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT SHE THOUGHT SHAKESPEARE A TERRIBLE FELLOW THE FORMATION WENT ON VERY SLOWLY I PRESSED TRADDLES INTO THE SERVICE WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE AND WHENEVER HE CAME TO SEE US EXPLODED MY MINES UPON HIM FOR THE EDIFICATION OF DORA AT SECOND HAND THE AMOUNT OF PRACTICAL WISDOM I BESTOWED UPON TRADDLES IN THIS MANNER WAS IMMENSE AND OF THE BEST QUALITY BUT IT HAD NO OTHER EFFECT UPON DORA THAN TO DEPRESS HER SPIRITS AND MAKE HER ALWAYS NERVOUS WITH THE DREAD THAT IT WOULD BE HER TURN NEXT I FOUND MYSELF IN THE CONDITION OF A SCHOOLMASTER A TRAP A PITFALL OF ALWAYS PLAYING SPIDER TO DORAS FLY AND ALWAYS POUNCING OUT OF MY HOLE TO HER INFINITE DISTURBANCE STILL LOOKING FORWARD THROUGH THIS INTERMEDIATE STAGE TO THE TIME WHEN THERE SHOULD BE A PERFECT SYMPATHY BETWEEN DORA AND ME AND WHEN I SHOULD HAVE FORMED HER MIND TO MY ENTIRE SATISFACTION I PERSEVERED EVEN FOR MONTHS FINDING AT LAST HOWEVER THAT ALTHOUGH I HAD BEEN ALL THIS TIME A VERY PORCUPINE OR HEDGEHOG BRISTLING ALL OVER WITH DETERMINATION I HAD EFFECTED NOTHING IT BEGAN TO OCCUR TO ME THAT PERHAPS DORAS MIND WAS ALREADY FORMED ON FURTHER CONSIDERATION THIS APPEARED SO LIKELY THAT I ABANDONED MY SCHEME WHICH HAD HAD A MORE PROMISING APPEARANCE IN WORDS THAN IN ACTION RESOLVING HENCEFORTH TO BE SATISFIED WITH MY CHILDWIFE AND TO TRY TO CHANGE HER INTO NOTHING ELSE BY ANY PROCESS I WAS HEARTILY TIRED OF BEING SAGACIOUS AND PRUDENT BY MYSELF AND OF SEEING MY DARLING UNDER RESTRAINT SO I BOUGHT A PRETTY PAIR OF EARRINGS FOR HER AND A COLLAR FOR JIP AND WENT HOME ONE DAY TO MAKE MYSELF AGREEABLE DORA WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE LITTLE PRESENTS AND KISSED ME JOYFULLY BUT THERE WAS A SHADOW BETWEEN US HOWEVER SLIGHT AND I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE THERE IF THERE MUST BE SUCH A SHADOW ANYWHERE I WOULD KEEP IT FOR THE FUTURE IN MY OWN BREAST I SAT DOWN BY MY WIFE ON THE SOFA AND PUT THE EARRINGS IN HER EARS AND THEN I TOLD HER THAT I FEARED WE HAD NOT BEEN QUITE AS GOOD COMPANY LATELY AS WE USED TO BE AND THAT THE FAULT WAS MINE WHICH I SINCERELY FELT AND WHICH INDEED IT WAS THE TRUTH IS DORA MY LIFE I SAID I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO BE WISE AND TO MAKE ME WISE TOO SAID DORA TIMIDLY HAVENT YOU DOADY I NODDED ASSENT TO THE PRETTY INQUIRY OF THE RAISED EYEBROWS AND KISSED THE PARTED LIPS ITS OF NOT A BIT OF USE SAID DORA SHAKING HER HEAD UNTIL THE EARRINGS RANG AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT A LITTLE THING I AM AND WHAT I WANTED YOU TO CALL ME FROM THE FIRST IF YOU CANT DO SO I AM AFRAID YOULL NEVER LIKE ME ARE YOU SURE YOU DONT THINK SOMETIMES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE DONE WHAT MY DEAR FOR SHE MADE NO EFFORT TO PROCEED NOTHING SAID DORA NOTHING I REPEATED SHE PUT HER ARMS ROUND MY NECK AND LAUGHED AND CALLED HERSELF BY HER FAVOURITE NAME OF A GOOSE AND HID HER FACE ON MY SHOULDER IN SUCH A PROFUSION OF CURLS THAT IT WAS QUITE A TASK TO CLEAR THEM AWAY AND SEE IT DONT I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE DONE NOTHING THAN TO HAVE TRIED TO FORM MY LITTLE WIFES MIND SAID I LAUGHING AT MYSELF IS THAT THE QUESTION YES INDEED I DO IS THAT WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING CRIED DORA OH WHAT A SHOCKING BOY BUT I SHALL NEVER TRY ANY MORE SAID I FOR I LOVE HER DEARLY AS SHE IS WITHOUT A STORYREALLY INQUIRED DORA CREEPING CLOSER TO ME WHY SHOULD I SEEK TO CHANGE SAID I WHAT HAS BEEN SO PRECIOUS TO ME FOR SO LONG YOU NEVER CAN SHOW BETTER THAN AS YOUR OWN NATURAL SELF MY SWEET DORA AND WELL TRY NO CONCEITED EXPERIMENTS BUT GO BACK TO OUR OLD WAY AND BE HAPPY AND BE HAPPY RETURNED DORA YES ALL DAY AND YOU WONT MIND THINGS GOING A TINY MORSEL WRONG SOMETIMES NO NO SAID I WE MUST DO THE BEST WE CAN AND YOU WONT TELL ME ANY MORE THAT WE MAKE OTHER PEOPLE BAD COAXED DORA WILL YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW ITS SO DREADFULLY CROSS NO NO SAID I ITS BETTER FOR ME TO BE STUPID THAN UNCOMFORTABLE ISNT IT SAID DORA BETTER TO BE NATURALLY DORA THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD IN THE WORLD AH DOADY ITS A LARGE PLACE SHE SHOOK HER HEAD TURNED HER DELIGHTED BRIGHT EYES UP TO MINE KISSED ME BROKE INTO A MERRY LAUGH AND SPRANG AWAY TO PUT ON JIPS NEW COLLAR SO ENDED MY LAST ATTEMPT TO MAKE ANY CHANGE IN DORA I HAD BEEN UNHAPPY IN TRYING IT I COULD NOT ENDURE MY OWN SOLITARY WISDOM I COULD NOT RECONCILE IT WITH HER FORMER APPEAL TO ME AS MY CHILDWIFE I RESOLVED TO DO WHAT I COULD IN A QUIET WAY TO IMPROVE OUR PROCEEDINGS MYSELF BUT I FORESAW THAT MY UTMOST WOULD BE VERY LITTLE OR I MUST DEGENERATE INTO THE SPIDER AGAIN AND BE FOR EVER LYING IN WAIT AND THE SHADOW I HAVE MENTIONED THAT WAS NOT TO BE BETWEEN US ANY MORE BUT WAS TO REST WHOLLY ON MY OWN HEART HOW DID THAT FALL THE OLD UNHAPPY FEELING PERVADED MY LIFE IT WAS DEEPENED IF IT WERE CHANGED AT ALL BUT IT WAS AS UNDEFINED AS EVER AND ADDRESSED ME LIKE A STRAIN OF SORROWFUL MUSIC FAINTLY HEARD IN THE NIGHT I LOVED MY WIFE DEARLY AND I WAS HAPPY BUT THE HAPPINESS I HAD VAGUELY ANTICIPATED ONCE WAS NOT THE HAPPINESS I ENJOYED AND THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING WANTING IN FULFILMENT OF THE COMPACT I HAVE MADE WITH MYSELF TO REFLECT MY MIND ON THIS PAPER I AGAIN EXAMINE IT CLOSELY AND BRING ITS SECRETS TO THE LIGHT WHAT I MISSED I STILL REGARDEDI ALWAYS REGARDEDAS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN A DREAM OF MY YOUTHFUL FANCY THAT WAS INCAPABLE OF REALIZATION THAT I WAS NOW DISCOVERING TO BE SO WITH SOME NATURAL PAIN AS ALL MEN DID BUT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR ME IF MY WIFE COULD HAVE HELPED ME MORE AND SHARED THE MANY THOUGHTS IN WHICH I HAD NO PARTNER AND THAT THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN I KNEW BETWEEN THESE TWO IRRECONCILABLE CONCLUSIONS THE ONE THAT WHAT I FELT WAS GENERAL AND UNAVOIDABLE THE OTHER THAT IT WAS PARTICULAR TO ME AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT I BALANCED CURIOUSLY WITH NO DISTINCT SENSE OF THEIR OPPOSITION TO EACH OTHER WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE AIRY DREAMS OF YOUTH THAT ARE INCAPABLE OF REALIZATION I THOUGHT OF THE BETTER STATE PRECEDING MANHOOD THAT I HAD OUTGROWN AND THEN THE CONTENTED DAYS WITH AGNES IN THE DEAR OLD HOUSE AROSE BEFORE ME LIKE SPECTRES OF THE DEAD THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME RENEWAL IN ANOTHER WORLD BUT NEVER MORE COULD BE REANIMATED HERE SOMETIMES THE SPECULATION CAME INTO MY THOUGHTS WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED OR WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF DORA AND I HAD NEVER KNOWN EACH OTHER BUT SHE WAS SO INCORPORATED WITH MY EXISTENCE THAT IT WAS THE IDLEST OF ALL FANCIES AND WOULD SOON RISE OUT OF MY REACH AND SIGHT LIKE GOSSAMER FLOATING IN THE AIR I ALWAYS LOVED HER WHAT I AM DESCRIBING SLUMBERED AND HALF AWOKE AND SLEPT AGAIN IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF MY MIND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF IT IN ME I KNOW OF NO INFLUENCE IT HAD IN ANYTHING I SAID OR DID I BORE THE WEIGHT OF ALL OUR LITTLE CARES AND ALL MY PROJECTS DORA HELD THE PENS AND WE BOTH FELT THAT OUR SHARES WERE ADJUSTED AS THE CASE REQUIRED SHE WAS TRULY FOND OF ME AND PROUD OF ME AND WHEN AGNES WROTE A FEW EARNEST WORDS IN HER LETTERS TO DORA OF THE PRIDE AND INTEREST WITH WHICH MY OLD FRIENDS HEARD OF MY GROWING REPUTATION AND READ MY BOOK AS IF THEY HEARD ME SPEAKING ITS CONTENTS DORA READ THEM OUT TO ME WITH TEARS OF JOY IN HER BRIGHT EYES AND SAID I WAS A DEAR OLD CLEVER FAMOUS BOY THE FIRST MISTAKEN IMPULSE OF AN UNDISCIPLINED HEART THOSE WORDS OF MRS STRONGS WERE CONSTANTLY RECURRING TO ME AT THIS TIME WERE ALMOST ALWAYS PRESENT TO MY MIND I AWOKE WITH THEM OFTEN IN THE NIGHT I REMEMBER TO HAVE EVEN READ THEM IN DREAMS INSCRIBED UPON THE WALLS OF HOUSES FOR I KNEW NOW THAT MY OWN HEART WAS UNDISCIPLINED WHEN IT FIRST LOVED DORA AND THAT IF IT HAD BEEN DISCIPLINED IT NEVER COULD HAVE FELT WHEN WE WERE MARRIED WHAT IT HAD FELT IN ITS SECRET EXPERIENCE THERE CAN BE NO DISPARITY IN MARRIAGE LIKE UNSUITABILITY OF MIND AND PURPOSE THOSE WORDS I REMEMBERED TOO I HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ADAPT DORA TO MYSELF AND FOUND IT IMPRACTICABLE IT REMAINED FOR ME TO ADAPT MYSELF TO DORA TO SHARE WITH HER WHAT I COULD AND BE HAPPY TO BEAR ON MY OWN SHOULDERS WHAT I MUST AND BE HAPPY STILL THIS WAS THE DISCIPLINE TO WHICH I TRIED TO BRING MY HEART WHEN I BEGAN TO THINK IT MADE MY SECOND YEAR MUCH HAPPIER THAN MY FIRST AND WHAT WAS BETTER STILL MADE DORAS LIFE ALL SUNSHINE BUT AS THAT YEAR WORE ON DORA WAS NOT STRONG I HAD HOPED THAT LIGHTER HANDS THAN MINE WOULD HELP TO MOULD HER CHARACTER AND THAT A BABYSMILE UPON HER BREAST MIGHT CHANGE MY CHILDWIFE TO A WOMAN IT WAS NOT TO BE THE SPIRIT FLUTTERED FOR A MOMENT ON THE THRESHOLD OF ITS LITTLE PRISON AND UNCONSCIOUS OF CAPTIVITY TOOK WING WHEN I CAN RUN ABOUT AGAIN AS I USED TO DO AUNT SAID DORA I SHALL MAKE JIP RACE HE IS GETTING QUITE SLOW AND LAZY I SUSPECT MY DEAR SAID MY AUNT QUIETLY WORKING BY HER SIDE HE HAS A WORSE DISORDER

HEAD AND SHOULDERS HE MUST HAVE A PIECE OF FLANNEL IN HIS HOUSE THIS WINTER AND I SHOULDNT WONDER IF HE CAME OUT QUITE FRESH AGAIN WITH THE FLOWERS IN THE SPRING BLESS THE LITTLE DOG EXCLAIMED MY AUNT IF HE HAD AS MANY LIVES AS A CAT AND WAS ON THE POINT OF LOSING EM ALL HED BARK AT ME WITH HIS LAST BREATH I BELIEVE DORA HAD HELPED HIM UP ON THE SOFA WHERE HE REALLY WAS DEFYING MY AUNT TO SUCH A FURIOUS EXTENT THAT HE COULDNT KEEP STRAIGHT BUT BARKED HIMSELF SIDEWAYS THE MORE MY AUNT LOOKED AT HIM THE MORE HE REPROACHED HER FOR SHE HAD LATELY TAKEN TO SPECTACLES AND FOR SOME INSCRUTABLE REASON HE CONSIDERED THE GLASSES PERSONAL DORA MADE HIM LIE DOWN BY HER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF PERSUASION AND WHEN HE WAS QUIET DREW ONE OF HIS LONG EARS THROUGH AND THROUGH HER HAND REPEATING THOUGHTFULLY EVEN LITTLE JIP OH POOR FELLOW HIS LUNGS ARE GOOD ENOUGH SAID MY AUNT GAILY AND HIS DISLIKES ARE NOT AT ALL FEEBLE HE HAS A GOOD MANY YEARS BEFORE HIM NO DOUBT BUT IF YOU WANT A DOG TO RACE WITH LITTLE BLOSSOM HE HAS LIVED TOO WELL FOR THAT AND ILL GIVE YOU ONE THANK YOU AUNT SAID DORA FAINTLY BUT DONT PLEASE NO SAID MY AUNT TAKING OFF HER SPECTACLES I COULDNT HAVE ANY OTHER DOG BUT JIP SAID DORA IT WOULD BE SO UNKIND TO JIP BESIDES I COULDNT BE SUCH FRIENDS WITH ANY OTHER DOG BUT JIP BECAUSE HE WOULDNT HAVE KNOWN ME BEFORE I WAS MARRIED AND WOULDNT HAVE BARKED AT DOADY WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO OUR HOUSE I COULDNT CARE FOR ANY OTHER DOG BUT JIP I AM AFRAID AUNT TO BE SURE SAID MY AUNT PATTING HER CHEEK AGAIN YOU ARE RIGHT YOU ARE NOT OFFENDED SAID DORA ARE YOU WHY WHAT A

LITTLE LONGER MY PRETTY DORA WHEN SHE CAME DOWN TO DINNER ON THE ENSUING SUNDAY AND WAS SO GLAD TO SEE OLD TRADDLES WHO ALWAYS DINED WITH US ON SUNDAY WE THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE RUNNING ABOUT AS SHE USED TO DO IN A FEW DAYS BUT THEY SAID WAIT A FEW DAYS MORE AND THEN WAIT A FEW DAYS MORE AND STILL SHE NEITHER RAN NOR WALKED SHE LOOKED VERY PRETTY AND WAS VERY MERRY BUT THE LITTLE FEET THAT USED TO BE SO NIMBLE WHEN THEY DANCED ROUND JIP WERE DULL AND MOTIONLESS I BEGAN TO CARRY HER DOWNSTAIRS EVERY MORNING AND UPSTAIRS EVERY NIGHT SHE WOULD CLASP ME ROUND THE NECK AND LAUGH THE WHILE AS IF I DID IT FOR A WAGER JIP WOULD BARK AND CAPER ROUND US AND GO ON BEFORE AND LOOK BACK ON THE LANDING BREATHING SHORT TO SEE THAT WE WERE COMING MY AUNT THE BEST AND MOST CHEERFUL OF NURSES WOULD TRUDGE AFTER US A MOVING MASS OF SHAWLS AND PILLOWS MR DICK WOULD NOT HAVE RELINQUISHED HIS POST OF CANDLEBEARER TO ANYONE ALIVE TRADDLES WOULD BE OFTEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE LOOKING ON AND TAKING CHARGE OF SPORTIVE MESSAGES FROM DORA TO THE DEAREST GIRL IN THE WORLD WE MADE QUITE A GAY PROCESSION OF IT AND MY CHILDWIFE WAS THE GAYEST THERE BUT SOMETIMES WHEN I TOOK HER UP AND FELT THAT SHE WAS LIGHTER IN MY ARMS A DEAD BLANK FEELING CAME UPON ME AS IF I WERE APPROACHING TO SOME FROZEN REGION YET UNSEEN THAT NUMBED MY LIFE I AVOIDED THE RECOGNITION OF THIS FEELING BY ANY NAME OR BY ANY COMMUNING WITH MYSELF UNTIL ONE NIGHT WHEN IT WAS VERY STRONG UPON ME AND MY AUNT HAD LEFT HER WITH A PARTING CRY OF GOOD NIGHT LITTLE BLOSSOM I SAT DOWN AT MY DESK ALONE AND TRIED TO THINK OH WHAT A FATAL NAME IT WAS AND HOW THE BLOSSOM WITHERED IN ITS BLOOM UPON THE TREE CHAPTER I AM INVOLVED IN MYSTERY I RECEIVED ONE MORNING BY THE POST THE FOLLOWING LETTER DATED CANTERBURY AND ADDRESSED TO ME AT DOCTORS COMMONS WHICH I READ WITH SOME SURPRISE MY DEAR SIR CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND MY INDIVIDUAL CONTROL HAVE FOR A CONSIDERABLE LAPSE OF TIME EFFECTED A SEVERANCE OF THAT INTIMACY WHICH IN THE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES CONCEDED TO ME IN THE MIDST OF MY PROFESSIONAL DUTIES OF CONTEMPLATING THE SCENES AND EVENTS OF THE PAST TINGED BY THE PRISMATIC HUES OF MEMORY HAS EVER AFFORDED ME AS IT EVER MUST CONTINUE TO AFFORD GRATIFYING EMOTIONS OF NO COMMON DESCRIPTION THIS FACT MY DEAR SIR COMBINED WITH THE DISTINGUISHED ELEVATION TO WHICH YOUR TALENTS HAVE RAISED YOU DETERS ME FROM PRESUMING TO ASPIRE TO THE LIBERTY OF ADDRESSING THE COMPANION OF MY YOUTH BY THE FAMILIAR APPELLATION OF COPPERFIELD IT IS SUFFICIENT TO KNOW THAT THE NAME TO WHICH I DO MYSELF THE HONOUR TO REFER WILL EVER BE TREASURED AMONG THE MUNIMENTS OF OUR HOUSE I ALLUDE TO THE ARCHIVES CONNECTED WITH OUR FORMER LODGERS PRESERVED BY MRS MICAWBER WITH SENTIMENTS OF PERSONAL ESTEEM AMOUNTING TO AFFECTION IT IS NOT FOR ONE SITUATED THROUGH HIS ORIGINAL ERRORS AND A FORTUITOUS COMBINATION OF UNPROPITIOUS EVENTS AS IS THE FOUNDERED BARK IF HE MAY BE ALLOWED TO ASSUME SO MARITIME A DENOMINATION WHO NOW TAKES UP THE PEN TO ADDRESS YOUIT IS NOT I REPEAT FOR ONE SO CIRCUMSTANCED TO ADOPT THE LANGUAGE OF COMPLIMENT OR OF CONGRATULATION THAT HE LEAVES TO ABLER AND TO PURER HANDS IF YOUR MORE IMPORTANT AVOCATIONS SHOULD ADMIT OF YOUR EVER TRACING THESE IMPERFECT CHARACTERS THUS FARWHICH MAY BE OR MAY NOT BE AS CIRCUMSTANCES ARISEYOU WILL NATURALLY INQUIRE BY WHAT OBJECT AM I INFLUENCED THEN IN INDITING THE PRESENT MISSIVE ALLOW ME TO SAY THAT I FULLY DEFER TO THE REASONABLE CHARACTER OF THAT INQUIRY AND PROCEED TO DEVELOP IT PREMISING THAT IT IS NOT AN OBJECT OF A PECUNIARY NATURE WITHOUT MORE DIRECTLY REFERRING TO ANY LATENT ABILITY THAT MAY POSSIBLY EXIST ON MY PART OF WIELDING THE THUNDERBOLT OR DIRECTING THE DEVOURING AND AVENGING FLAME IN ANY QUARTER I MAY BE PERMITTED TO OBSERVE IN PASSING THAT MY BRIGHTEST VISIONS ARE FOR EVER DISPELLEDTHAT MY PEACE IS SHATTERED AND MY POWER OF ENJOYMENT DESTROYEDTHAT MY HEART IS NO LONGER IN THE RIGHT PLACEAND THAT I NO MORE WALK ERECT BEFORE MY FELLOW MAN THE CANKER IS IN THE FLOWER THE CUP IS BITTER TO THE BRIM THE WORM IS AT HIS WORK AND WILL SOON DISPOSE OF HIS VICTIM THE SOONER THE BETTER BUT I WILL NOT DIGRESS PLACED IN A MENTAL POSITION OF PECULIAR PAINFULNESS BEYOND THE ASSUAGING REACH EVEN OF MRS MICAWBERS INFLUENCE THOUGH EXERCISED IN THE TRIPARTITE CHARACTER OF WOMAN WIFE AND MOTHER IT IS MY INTENTION TO FLY FROM MYSELF FOR A SHORT PERIOD AND DEVOTE A RESPITE OF EIGHTANDFORTY HOURS TO REVISITING SOME METROPOLITAN SCENES OF PAST ENJOYMENT AMONG OTHER HAVENS OF DOMESTIC TRANQUILLITY AND PEACE OF MIND MY FEET WILL NATURALLY TEND TOWARDS THE KINGS BENCH PRISON IN STATING THAT I SHALL BE D V ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SOUTH WALL OF THAT PLACE OF INCARCERATION ON CIVIL PROCESS THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW AT SEVEN IN THE EVENING PRECISELY MY OBJECT IN THIS EPISTOLARY COMMUNICATION IS ACCOMPLISHED I DO NOT FEEL WARRANTED IN SOLICITING MY FORMER FRIEND MR COPPERFIELD OR MY FORMER FRIEND MR THOMAS TRADDLES OF THE INNER TEMPLE IF THAT GENTLEMAN IS STILL EXISTENT AND FORTHCOMING TO CONDESCEND TO MEET ME AND RENEW SO FAR AS MAY BE OUR PAST RELATIONS OF THE OLDEN TIME I CONFINE MYSELF TO THROWING OUT THE OBSERVATION THAT AT THE HOUR AND PLACE I HAVE INDICATED MAY BE FOUND SUCH RUINED VESTIGES AS YET REMAIN OF A FALLEN TOWER WILKINS MICAWBER PS IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO SUPERADD TO THE ABOVE THE STATEMENT THAT MRS MICAWBER IS NOT IN CONFIDENTIAL POSSESSION OF MY INTENTIONS I READ THE LETTER OVER SEVERAL TIMES MAKING DUE ALLOWANCE FOR MR MICAWBERS LOFTY STYLE OF COMPOSITION AND FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY RELISH WITH WHICH HE SAT DOWN AND WROTE LONG LETTERS ON ALL POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE OCCASIONS I STILL BELIEVED THAT SOMETHING IMPORTANT LAY HIDDEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS ROUNDABOUT COMMUNICATION I PUT IT DOWN TO THINK ABOUT IT AND TOOK IT UP AGAIN TO READ IT ONCE MORE AND WAS STILL PURSUING IT WHEN TRADDLES FOUND ME IN THE HEIGHT OF MY PERPLEXITY MY DEAR FELLOW SAID I I NEVER WAS BETTER PLEASED TO SEE YOU YOU COME TO GIVE ME THE BENEFIT OF YOUR SOBER JUDGEMENT AT A MOST OPPORTUNE TIME I HAVE RECEIVED A VERY SINGULAR LETTER TRADDLES FROM MR MICAWBER NO CRIED TRADDLES YOU DONT SAY SO AND I HAVE RECEIVED ONE FROM MRS MICAWBER WITH THAT TRADDLES WHO WAS FLUSHED WITH WALKING AND WHOSE HAIR UNDER THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF EXERCISE AND EXCITEMENT STOOD ON END AS IF HE SAW A CHEERFUL GHOST PRODUCED HIS LETTER AND MADE AN EXCHANGE WITH ME I WATCHED HIM INTO THE HEART OF MR MICAWBERS LETTER AND RETURNED THE ELEVATION OF EYEBROWS WITH WHICH HE SAID WIELDING THE THUNDERBOLT OR DIRECTING THE DEVOURING AND AVENGING FLAME BLESS ME COPPERFIELDAND THEN ENTERED ON THE PERUSAL OF MRS MICAWBERS EPISTLE IT RAN THUS MY BEST REGARDS TO MR THOMAS TRADDLES AND IF HE SHOULD STILL REMEMBER ONE WHO FORMERLY HAD THE HAPPINESS OF BEING WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIM MAY I BEG A FEW MOMENTS OF HIS LEISURE TIME I ASSURE MR T T THAT I WOULD NOT INTRUDE UPON HIS KINDNESS WERE I IN ANY OTHER POSITION THAN ON THE CONFINES OF DISTRACTION THOUGH HARROWING TO MYSELF TO MENTION THE ALIENATION OF MR MICAWBER FORMERLY SO DOMESTICATED FROM HIS WIFE AND FAMILY IS THE CAUSE OF MY ADDRESSING MY UNHAPPY APPEAL TO MR TRADDLES AND SOLICITING HIS BEST INDULGENCE MR T CAN FORM NO ADEQUATE IDEA OF THE CHANGE IN MR MICAWBERS CONDUCT OF HIS WILDNESS OF HIS VIOLENCE IT HAS GRADUALLY AUGMENTED UNTIL IT ASSUMES THE APPEARANCE OF ABERRATION OF INTELLECT SCARCELY A DAY PASSES I ASSURE MR TRADDLES ON WHICH SOME PAROXYSM DOES NOT TAKE PLACE MR T WILL NOT REQUIRE ME TO DEPICT MY FEELINGS WHEN I INFORM HIM THAT I HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR MR MICAWBER ASSERT THAT HE HAS SOLD HIMSELF TO THE D MYSTERY AND SECRECY HAVE LONG BEEN HIS PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTIC HAVE LONG REPLACED UNLIMITED CONFIDENCE THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION EVEN BEING ASKED IF THERE IS ANYTHING HE WOULD PREFER FOR DINNER CAUSES HIM TO EXPRESS A WISH FOR A SEPARATION LAST NIGHT ON BEING CHILDISHLY SOLICITED FOR TWOPENCE TO BUY LEMONSTUNNERSA LOCAL SWEETMEATHE PRESENTED AN OYSTERKNIFE AT THE TWINS I ENTREAT MR TRADDLES TO BEAR WITH ME IN ENTERING INTO THESE DETAILS WITHOUT THEM MR T WOULD INDEED FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FORM THE FAINTEST

QUICK EYE OF AFFECTION IS NOT EASILY BLINDED WHEN OF THE FEMALE SEX MR MICAWBER IS GOING TO LONDON THOUGH HE STUDIOUSLY CONCEALED HIS HAND THIS MORNING BEFORE BREAKFAST IN WRITING THE DIRECTIONCARD

FERVENTLY IMPLORE MR T TO SEE MY MISGUIDED HUSBAND AND TO REASON WITH HIM DARE I ASK MR T TO ENDEAVOUR TO STEP IN BETWEEN MR MICAWBER AND HIS AGONIZED FAMILY OH NO FOR THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH IF MR COPPERFIELD SHOULD YET REMEMBER ONE UNKNOWN TO FAME WILL MR T TAKE CHARGE OF MY UNALTERABLE REGARDS AND SIMILAR ENTREATIES IN ANY CASE HE WILL HAVE THE BENEVOLENCE TO CONSIDER THIS COMMUNICATION STRICTLY PRIVATE AND ON NO ACCOUNT WHATEVER TO BE ALLUDED TO HOWEVER DISTANTLY IN THE PRESENCE OF MR MICAWBER IF MR T SHOULD EVER REPLY TO IT WHICH I CANNOT BUT FEEL TO BE MOST IMPROBABLE A LETTER ADDRESSED TO M E POST OFFICE CANTERBURY WILL BE FRAUGHT WITH LESS PAINFUL CONSEQUENCES THAN ANY ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY TO ONE WHO SUBSCRIBES HERSELF IN EXTREME DISTRESS MR THOMAS TRADDLESS RESPECTFUL FRIEND AND SUPPLIANT EMMA MICAWBER WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT LETTER SAID TRADDLES CASTING HIS EYES UPON ME WHEN I HAD READ IT TWICE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE OTHER SAID I FOR HE WAS STILL READING IT WITH KNITTED BROWS I THINK THAT THE TWO TOGETHER COPPERFIELD REPLIED TRADDLES MEAN MORE THAN MR AND MRS MICAWBER USUALLY MEAN IN THEIR CORRESPONDENCEBUT I DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE BOTH WRITTEN IN GOOD FAITH I HAVE NO DOUBT AND WITHOUT ANY COLLUSION POOR THING HE WAS NOW ALLUDING TO MRS MICAWBERS LETTER AND WE WERE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE COMPARING THE TWO IT WILL BE A CHARITY TO WRITE TO HER AT ALL EVENTS AND TELL HER THAT WE WILL NOT FAIL TO SEE MR MICAWBER I ACCEDED TO THIS THE MORE READILY BECAUSE I NOW REPROACHED MYSELF WITH HAVING TREATED HER FORMER LETTER RATHER LIGHTLY IT HAD SET ME THINKING A GOOD DEAL AT THE TIME AS I HAVE MENTIONED IN ITS PLACE BUT MY ABSORPTION IN MY OWN AFFAIRS MY EXPERIENCE OF THE FAMILY AND MY HEARING NOTHING MORE HAD GRADUALLY ENDED IN MY DISMISSING THE SUBJECT I HAD OFTEN THOUGHT OF THE MICAWBERS BUT CHIEFLY TO WONDER WHAT PECUNIARY LIABILITIES THEY WERE ESTABLISHING IN CANTERBURY AND TO RECALL HOW SHY MR MICAWBER WAS OF ME WHEN HE BECAME CLERK TO URIAH HEEP HOWEVER I NOW WROTE A COMFORTING LETTER TO MRS MICAWBER IN OUR JOINT NAMES AND WE BOTH SIGNED IT AS WE WALKED INTO TOWN TO POST IT TRADDLES AND I HELD A LONG CONFERENCE AND LAUNCHED INTO A NUMBER OF SPECULATIONS WHICH I NEED NOT REPEAT WE TOOK MY AUNT INTO OUR COUNSELS IN THE AFTERNOON BUT OUR ONLY DECIDED CONCLUSION WAS THAT WE WOULD BE VERY PUNCTUAL IN KEEPING MR MICAWBERS APPOINTMENT ALTHOUGH WE APPEARED AT THE STIPULATED PLACE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME WE FOUND MR MICAWBER ALREADY THERE HE WAS STANDING WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED OVER AGAINST THE WALL LOOKING AT THE SPIKES ON THE TOP WITH A SENTIMENTAL EXPRESSION AS IF THEY WERE THE INTERLACING BOUGHS OF TREES THAT HAD SHADED HIM IN HIS YOUTH WHEN WE ACCOSTED HIM HIS MANNER WAS SOMETHING MORE CONFUSED AND SOMETHING LESS GENTEEL THAN OF YORE HE HAD RELINQUISHED HIS LEGAL SUIT OF BLACK FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS EXCURSION AND WORE THE OLD SURTOUT AND TIGHTS BUT NOT QUITE WITH THE OLD AIR HE GRADUALLY PICKED UP MORE AND MORE OF IT AS WE CONVERSED WITH HIM BUT HIS VERY EYEGLASS SEEMED TO HANG LESS EASILY AND HIS SHIRTCOLLAR THOUGH STILL OF THE OLD FORMIDABLE DIMENSIONS RATHER DROOPED GENTLEMEN SAID MR MICAWBER AFTER THE FIRST SALUTATIONS YOU ARE FRIENDS IN NEED AND FRIENDS INDEED ALLOW ME TO OFFER MY INQUIRIES WITH REFERENCE TO THE PHYSICAL WELFARE OF MRS COPPERFIELD IN ESSE AND MRS TRADDLES IN POSSEPRESUMING THAT IS TO SAY THAT MY FRIEND MR TRADDLES IS NOT YET UNITED TO THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTIONS FOR WEAL AND FOR WOE WE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS POLITENESS AND MADE SUITABLE REPLIES HE THEN DIRECTED OUR ATTENTION TO THE WALL AND WAS BEGINNING I ASSURE YOU GENTLEMEN WHEN I VENTURED TO OBJECT TO THAT CEREMONIOUS FORM OF ADDRESS AND TO BEG THAT HE WOULD SPEAK TO US IN THE OLD WAY MY DEAR COPPERFIELD HE RETURNED PRESSING MY HAND YOUR CORDIALITY OVERPOWERS ME THIS RECEPTION OF A SHATTERED FRAGMENT OF THE TEMPLE ONCE CALLED MANIF I MAY BE PERMITTED SO TO EXPRESS MYSELFBESPEAKS A HEART THAT IS AN HONOUR TO OUR COMMON NATURE I WAS ABOUT TO OBSERVE THAT I AGAIN BEHOLD THE SERENE SPOT WHERE SOME OF THE HAPPIEST HOURS OF MY EXISTENCE FLEETED BY MADE SO I AM SURE BY MRS MICAWBER SAID I I HOPE SHE IS WELL THANK YOU RETURNED MR MICAWBER WHOSE FACE CLOUDED AT THIS REFERENCE SHE IS BUT SOSO AND THIS SAID MR MICAWBER NODDING HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY IS THE BENCH WHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY REVOLVING YEARS THE OVERWHELMING PRESSURE OF PECUNIARY LIABILITIES WAS NOT PROCLAIMED FROM DAY TO DAY BY IMPORTUNE VOICES DECLINING TO VACATE THE PASSAGE WHERE THERE WAS NO KNOCKER ON THE DOOR FOR ANY CREDITOR TO APPEAL TO WHERE PERSONAL SERVICE OF PROCESS WAS NOT REQUIRED AND DETAINEES WERE MERELY LODGED AT THE GATE GENTLEMEN SAID MR MICAWBER WHEN THE SHADOW OF THAT IRONWORK ON THE SUMMIT OF THE BRICK STRUCTURE HAS BEEN REFLECTED ON THE GRAVEL OF THE PARADE I HAVE SEEN MY CHILDREN THREAD THE MAZES OF THE INTRICATE PATTERN AVOIDING THE DARK MARKS I HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH EVERY STONE IN THE PLACE IF I BETRAY WEAKNESS YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO EXCUSE ME WE HAVE ALL GOT ON IN LIFE SINCE THEN MR MICAWBER SAID I MR COPPERFIELD RETURNED MR MICAWBER BITTERLY WHEN I WAS AN INMATE OF THAT RETREAT I COULD LOOK MY FELLOWMAN IN THE FACE AND PUNCH HIS HEAD IF HE OFFENDED ME MY FELLOWMAN AND MYSELF ARE NO LONGER ON THOSE GLORIOUS TERMS TURNING FROM THE BUILDING IN A DOWNCAST MANNER MR MICAWBER ACCEPTED MY PROFFERED ARM ON ONE SIDE AND THE PROFFERED ARM OF TRADDLES ON THE OTHER AND WALKED AWAY BETWEEN US THERE ARE SOME LANDMARKS OBSERVED MR MICAWBER LOOKING FONDLY BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER ON THE ROAD TO THE TOMB WHICH BUT FOR THE IMPIETY OF THE ASPIRATION A MAN WOULD WISH NEVER TO HAVE PASSED SUCH IS THE BENCH IN MY CHEQUERED CAREER OH YOU ARE IN LOW SPIRITS MR MICAWBER SAID TRADDLES I AM SIR

HIM OFF INTO A NARROW STREET WHERE HE TOOK OUT HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF AND STOOD WITH HIS BACK TO A WALL IF I LOOKED AS GRAVELY AT HIM AS TRADDLES DID HE MUST HAVE FOUND OUR COMPANY BY NO MEANS INSPIRITING IT IS MY FATE SAID MR MICAWBER UNFEIGNEDLY SOBBING BUT DOING EVEN THAT WITH A SHADOW OF THE OLD EXPRESSION OF DOING SOMETHING GENTEEL IT IS MY FATE GENTLEMEN THAT THE FINER FEELINGS OF OUR NATURE HAVE BECOME REPROACHES TO ME MY HOMAGE TO MISS WICKFIELD IS A FLIGHT OF ARROWS IN MY BOSOM YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME IF YOU PLEASE TO WALK THE EARTH AS A VAGABOND THE WORM WILL SETTLE MY BUSINESS

WAS FOR THE MOST PART PLUNGED INTO DEEP GLOOM HE OCCASIONALLY MADE AN ATTEMPT TO SMARTEN HIMSELF AND HUM THE FAGEND OF A TUNE BUT HIS RELAPSES INTO PROFOUND MELANCHOLY WERE ONLY MADE THE MORE IMPRESSIVE BY THE MOCKERY OF A HAT EXCEEDINGLY ON ONE SIDE AND A SHIRTCOLLAR PULLED UP TO HIS EYES WE WENT TO MY AUNTS HOUSE RATHER THAN TO MINE BECAUSE OF DORAS NOT BEING WELL MY AUNT PRESENTED HERSELF ON BEING SENT FOR AND WELCOMED MR MICAWBER WITH GRACIOUS CORDIALITY MR MICAWBER KISSED HER HAND RETIRED TO THE WINDOW AND PULLING OUT HIS POCKETHANDKERCHIEF HAD A MENTAL WRESTLE WITH HIMSELF MR DICK WAS AT HOME HE WAS BY NATURE SO EXCEEDINGLY COMPASSIONATE OF ANYONE WHO SEEMED TO BE ILL AT EASE AND WAS SO QUICK TO FIND ANY SUCH PERSON OUT THAT HE SHOOK HANDS WITH MR MICAWBER AT LEAST HALFADOZEN TIMES IN FIVE MINUTES TO MR MICAWBER IN HIS TROUBLE THIS WARMTH ON THE PART OF A STRANGER WAS SO EXTREMELY TOUCHING THAT HE COULD ONLY SAY ON THE OCCASION OF EACH SUCCESSIVE SHAKE MY DEAR SIR YOU OVERPOWER ME WHICH GRATIFIED MR DICK SO MUCH THAT HE WENT AT IT AGAIN WITH GREATER VIGOUR THAN BEFORE THE FRIENDLINESS OF THIS GENTLEMAN SAID MR MICAWBER TO MY AUNT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME MAAM

WATCHED MR MICAWBER SO ANXIOUSLY IN HIS VACILLATIONS BETWEEN AN EVIDENT DISPOSITION TO REVEAL SOMETHING AND A COUNTERDISPOSITION TO REVEAL NOTHING THAT I WAS IN A PERFECT FEVER TRADDLES SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR WITH HIS EYES WIDE OPEN AND HIS HAIR MORE EMPHATICALLY ERECT THAN EVER STARED BY TURNS AT THE GROUND AND AT MR MICAWBER WITHOUT SO MUCH AS ATTEMPTING TO PUT IN A WORD MY AUNT THOUGH I SAW THAT HER SHREWDEST OBSERVATION WAS CONCENTRATED ON HER NEW GUEST HAD MORE USEFUL POSSESSION OF HER WITS THAN EITHER OF US FOR SHE HELD HIM IN CONVERSATION AND MADE IT NECESSARY FOR HIM TO TALK WHETHER HE LIKED IT OR NOT YOU ARE A VERY OLD FRIEND OF MY NEPHEWS MR MICAWBER SAID MY AUNT I WISH I HAD HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU BEFORE MADAM RETURNED MR MICAWBER I WISH I HAD HAD THE HONOUR OF

ABOUT THE COUNTRY SWALLOWING A SWORDBLADE AND EATING THE DEVOURING ELEMENT FOR ANYTHING THAT I CAN PERCEIVE TO THE CONTRARY IT IS STILL PROBABLE THAT MY CHILDREN MAY BE REDUCED TO SEEK A LIVELIHOOD BY PERSONAL CONTORTION WHILE MRS MICAWBER ABETS THEIR UNNATURAL FEATS BY PLAYING THE BARRELORGAN MR MICAWBER WITH A RANDOM BUT EXPRESSIVE FLOURISH OF HIS KNIFE SIGNIFIED THAT THESE PERFORMANCES MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE AFTER HE WAS NO MORE THEN RESUMED HIS PEELING WITH A DESPERATE AIR MY AUNT LEANED HER ELBOW ON THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE THAT SHE USUALLY KEPT BESIDE HER AND EYED HIM ATTENTIVELY NOTWITHSTANDING THE AVERSION WITH WHICH I REGARDED THE IDEA OF ENTRAPPING HIM INTO ANY DISCLOSURE HE WAS NOT PREPARED TO MAKE VOLUNTARILY I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM UP AT THIS POINT BUT FOR THE STRANGE PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH I SAW HIM ENGAGED WHEREOF HIS PUTTING THE LEMONPEEL INTO THE KETTLE THE SUGAR INTO THE SNUFFERTRAY THE SPIRIT INTO THE EMPTY JUG AND CONFIDENTLY ATTEMPTING TO POUR BOILING WATER

MICAWBER RUSHED OUT OF THE HOUSE LEAVING US IN A STATE OF EXCITEMENT HOPE AND WONDER THAT REDUCED US TO A CONDITION LITTLE BETTER THAN HIS OWN BUT EVEN THEN HIS PASSION FOR WRITING LETTERS WAS TOO STRONG TO BE RESISTED FOR WHILE WE WERE YET IN THE HEIGHT OF OUR EXCITEMENT HOPE AND WONDER THE FOLLOWING PASTORAL NOTE WAS BROUGHT TO ME FROM A NEIGHBOURING TAVERN AT WHICH HE HAD CALLED TO WRITE IT MOST SECRET AND CONFIDENTIAL MY DEAR SIR I BEG TO BE ALLOWED TO CONVEY THROUGH YOU MY APOLOGIES TO YOUR EXCELLENT AUNT FOR MY LATE EXCITEMENT AN EXPLOSION OF A SMOULDERING VOLCANO LONG SUPPRESSED WAS THE RESULT OF AN INTERNAL CONTEST MORE EASILY CONCEIVED THAN DESCRIBED I TRUST I RENDERED TOLERABLY INTELLIGIBLE MY APPOINTMENT FOR THE MORNING OF THIS DAY WEEK AT THE HOUSE OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT AT CANTERBURY WHERE MRS MICAWBER AND MYSELF HAD ONCE THE HONOUR OF UNITING OUR VOICES TO YOURS IN THE WELLKNOWN STRAIN OF THE IMMORTAL EXCISEMAN NURTURED BEYOND THE TWEED THE DUTY DONE AND ACT OF REPARATION PERFORMED WHICH CAN ALONE ENABLE ME TO CONTEMPLATE MY FELLOW MORTAL I SHALL BE KNOWN NO MORE I SHALL SIMPLY REQUIRE TO BE DEPOSITED IN THAT PLACE OF UNIVERSAL RESORT WHERE EACH IN HIS NARROW CELL FOR EVER LAID THE RUDE FOREFATHERS OF THE HAMLET SLEEP WITH THE PLAIN INSCRIPTION WILKINS MICAWBER CHAPTER MR PEGGOTTYS DREAM COMES TRUE BY THIS TIME SOME MONTHS HAD PASSED SINCE OUR INTERVIEW ON THE BANK OF THE RIVER WITH MARTHA I HAD NEVER SEEN HER SINCE BUT SHE HAD COMMUNICATED WITH MR PEGGOTTY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS NOTHING HAD COME OF HER ZEALOUS INTERVENTION NOR COULD I INFER FROM WHAT HE TOLD ME THAT ANY CLUE HAD BEEN OBTAINED FOR A MOMENT TO EMILYS FATE I CONFESS THAT I BEGAN TO DESPAIR OF HER RECOVERY AND GRADUALLY TO SINK DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE BELIEF THAT SHE WAS DEAD HIS CONVICTION REMAINED UNCHANGED SO FAR AS I KNOWAND I BELIEVE HIS HONEST HEART WAS TRANSPARENT TO MEHE NEVER WAVERED AGAIN IN HIS SOLEMN CERTAINTY OF FINDING HER HIS PATIENCE NEVER TIRED AND ALTHOUGH I TREMBLED FOR THE AGONY IT MIGHT ONE DAY BE TO HIM TO HAVE HIS STRONG ASSURANCE SHIVERED AT A BLOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SO RELIGIOUS IN IT SO AFFECTINGLY EXPRESSIVE OF ITS ANCHOR BEING IN THE PUREST DEPTHS OF HIS FINE NATURE THAT THE RESPECT AND HONOUR IN WHICH I HELD HIM WERE EXALTED EVERY DAY HIS WAS NOT A LAZY TRUSTFULNESS THAT HOPED AND DID NO MORE HE HAD BEEN A MAN OF STURDY ACTION ALL HIS LIFE AND HE KNEW THAT IN ALL THINGS WHEREIN HE WANTED HELP HE MUST DO HIS OWN PART FAITHFULLY AND HELP HIMSELF I HAVE KNOWN HIM SET OUT IN THE NIGHT ON A MISGIVING THAT THE LIGHT MIGHT NOT BE BY SOME ACCIDENT IN THE WINDOW OF THE OLD BOAT AND WALK TO YARMOUTH I HAVE KNOWN HIM ON READING SOMETHING IN THE NEWSPAPER THAT MIGHT APPLY TO HER TAKE UP HIS STICK AND GO FORTH ON A JOURNEY OF THREEOR FOURSCORE MILES HE MADE HIS WAY BY SEA TO NAPLES AND BACK AFTER HEARING THE NARRATIVE TO WHICH MISS DARTLE HAD ASSISTED ME ALL HIS JOURNEYS WERE RUGGEDLY PERFORMED FOR HE WAS ALWAYS STEADFAST IN A PURPOSE OF SAVING MONEY FOR EMILYS SAKE WHEN SHE SHOULD BE FOUND IN ALL THIS LONG PURSUIT I NEVER HEARD HIM REPINE I NEVER HEARD HIM SAY HE WAS FATIGUED OR OUT OF HEART DORA HAD OFTEN SEEN HIM SINCE OUR MARRIAGE AND WAS QUITE FOND OF HIM I FANCY HIS FIGURE BEFORE ME NOW STANDING NEAR HER SOFA WITH HIS ROUGH CAP IN HIS HAND AND THE BLUE EYES OF MY CHILDWIFE RAISED WITH A TIMID WONDER TO HIS FACE SOMETIMES OF AN EVENING ABOUT TWILIGHT WHEN HE CAME TO TALK WITH ME I WOULD INDUCE HIM TO SMOKE HIS PIPE IN THE GARDEN AS WE SLOWLY PACED TO AND FRO TOGETHER AND THEN THE PICTURE OF HIS DESERTED HOME AND THE COMFORTABLE AIR IT USED TO HAVE IN MY CHILDISH EYES OF AN EVENING WHEN THE FIRE WAS BURNING AND THE WIND MOANING ROUND IT CAME MOST VIVIDLY INTO MY MIND ONE EVENING AT THIS HOUR HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD FOUND MARTHA WAITING NEAR HIS LODGING ON THE PRECEDING NIGHT WHEN HE CAME OUT AND THAT SHE HAD ASKED HIM NOT TO LEAVE LONDON ON ANY ACCOUNT UNTIL HE SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER AGAIN DID SHE TELL YOU WHY I INQUIRED I ASKED HER MASR DAVY HE REPLIED BUT IT IS BUT FEW WORDS AS SHE EVER SAYS AND SHE ONY GOT MY PROMISE AND SO WENT AWAY DID SHE SAY WHEN YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE HER AGAIN I DEMANDED NO MASR DAVY HE RETURNED DRAWING HIS HAND THOUGHTFULLY DOWN HIS FACE I ASKED THAT TOO BUT IT WAS MORE SHE SAID THAN SHE COULD TELL AS I HAD LONG FORBORNE TO ENCOURAGE HIM WITH HOPES THAT HUNG ON THREADS I MADE NO OTHER COMMENT ON THIS INFORMATION THAN THAT I SUPPOSED HE WOULD SEE HER SOON SUCH SPECULATIONS AS IT ENGENDERED WITHIN ME I KEPT TO MYSELF AND THOSE WERE FAINT ENOUGH I WAS WALKING ALONE IN THE GARDEN ONE EVENING ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTERWARDS I REMEMBER THAT EVENING WELL IT WAS THE SECOND IN MR MICAWBERS WEEK OF SUSPENSE THERE HAD BEEN RAIN ALL DAY AND THERE WAS A DAMP FEELING IN THE AIR THE LEAVES WERE THICK UPON THE TREES AND HEAVY WITH WET BUT THE RAIN HAD CEASED THOUGH THE SKY WAS STILL DARK AND THE HOPEFUL BIRDS WERE SINGING CHEERFULLY AS I WALKED TO AND FRO IN THE GARDEN AND THE TWILIGHT BEGAN TO CLOSE AROUND ME THEIR LITTLE VOICES WERE HUSHED AND THAT PECULIAR SILENCE WHICH BELONGS TO SUCH AN EVENING IN THE COUNTRY WHEN THE LIGHTEST TREES ARE QUITE STILL SAVE FOR THE OCCASIONAL DROPPINGS FROM THEIR BOUGHS PREVAILED THERE WAS A LITTLE GREEN PERSPECTIVE OF TRELLISWORK AND IVY AT THE SIDE OF OUR COTTAGE THROUGH WHICH I COULD SEE FROM THE GARDEN WHERE I WAS WALKING INTO THE ROAD BEFORE THE HOUSE I HAPPENED TO TURN MY EYES TOWARDS THIS PLACE AS I WAS THINKING OF MANY THINGS AND I SAW A FIGURE BEYOND DRESSED IN A PLAIN CLOAK IT WAS BENDING EAGERLY TOWARDS ME AND BECKONING MARTHA SAID I GOING TO IT CAN YOU COME WITH ME SHE INQUIRED IN AN AGITATED WHISPER I HAVE BEEN TO HIM AND HE IS NOT AT HOME I WROTE DOWN WHERE HE WAS TO COME AND LEFT IT ON HIS TABLE WITH MY OWN HAND THEY SAID HE WOULD NOT BE OUT LONG I HAVE TIDINGS FOR HIM CAN YOU COME DIRECTLY MY ANSWER WAS TO PASS OUT AT THE GATE IMMEDIATELY SHE MADE A HASTY GESTURE WITH HER HAND AS IF TO ENTREAT MY PATIENCE AND MY SILENCE AND TURNED TOWARDS LONDON WHENCE AS HER DRESS BETOKENED SHE HAD COME EXPEDITIOUSLY ON FOOT I ASKED HER IF THAT WERE NOT OUR DESTINATION ON HER MOTIONING YES WITH THE SAME HASTY GESTURE AS BEFORE I STOPPED AN EMPTY COACH THAT WAS COMING BY AND WE GOT INTO IT WHEN I ASKED HER WHERE THE COACHMAN WAS TO DRIVE SHE ANSWERED ANYWHERE NEAR GOLDEN SQUARE AND QUICKTHEN SHRUNK INTO A CORNER WITH ONE TREMBLING HAND BEFORE HER FACE AND THE OTHER MAKING THE FORMER GESTURE AS IF SHE COULD NOT BEAR A VOICE NOW MUCH DISTURBED AND DAZZLED WITH CONFLICTING GLEAMS OF HOPE AND DREAD I LOOKED AT HER FOR SOME EXPLANATION BUT SEEING HOW STRONGLY SHE DESIRED TO REMAIN QUIET AND FEELING THAT IT WAS MY OWN NATURAL INCLINATION TOO AT SUCH A TIME I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO BREAK THE SILENCE WE PROCEEDED WITHOUT A WORD BEING SPOKEN SOMETIMES SHE GLANCED OUT OF THE WINDOW AS THOUGH SHE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING SLOWLY THOUGH INDEED WE WERE GOING FAST BUT OTHERWISE REMAINED EXACTLY AS AT FIRST WE ALIGHTED AT ONE OF THE ENTRANCES TO THE SQUARE SHE HAD MENTIONED WHERE I DIRECTED THE COACH TO WAIT NOT KNOWING BUT THAT WE MIGHT HAVE SOME OCCASION FOR IT SHE LAID HER HAND ON MY ARM AND HURRIED ME ON TO ONE OF THE SOMBRE STREETS OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL IN THAT PART WHERE THE HOUSES WERE ONCE FAIR DWELLINGS IN THE OCCUPATION OF SINGLE FAMILIES BUT HAVE AND HAD LONG DEGENERATED INTO POOR LODGINGS LET OFF IN ROOMS ENTERING AT THE OPEN DOOR OF ONE OF THESE AND RELEASING MY ARM SHE BECKONED ME TO FOLLOW HER UP THE COMMON STAIRCASE WHICH WAS LIKE A TRIBUTARY CHANNEL TO THE STREET THE HOUSE SWARMED WITH INMATES AS WE WENT UP DOORS OF ROOMS WERE OPENED AND PEOPLES HEADS PUT OUT AND WE PASSED OTHER PEOPLE ON THE STAIRS WHO WERE COMING DOWN IN GLANCING UP FROM THE OUTSIDE BEFORE WE ENTERED I HAD SEEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN LOLLING AT THE WINDOWS OVER FLOWERPOTS AND WE SEEMED TO HAVE ATTRACTED THEIR CURIOSITY FOR THESE WERE PRINCIPALLY THE OBSERVERS WHO LOOKED OUT OF THEIR DOORS IT WAS A BROAD PANELLED STAIRCASE WITH MASSIVE BALUSTRADES OF SOME DARK WOOD CORNICES ABOVE THE DOORS ORNAMENTED WITH CARVED FRUIT AND FLOWERS AND BROAD SEATS IN THE WINDOWS BUT ALL THESE TOKENS OF PAST GRANDEUR WERE MISERABLY DECAYED AND DIRTY ROT DAMP AND AGE HAD WEAKENED THE FLOORING WHICH IN MANY PLACES WAS UNSOUND AND EVEN UNSAFE SOME ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE I NOTICED TO INFUSE NEW BLOOD INTO THIS DWINDLING FRAME BY REPAIRING THE COSTLY OLD WOODWORK HERE AND THERE WITH COMMON DEAL BUT IT WAS LIKE THE MARRIAGE OF A REDUCED OLD NOBLE TO A PLEBEIAN PAUPER AND EACH PARTY TO THE ILLASSORTED UNION SHRUNK AWAY FROM THE OTHER SEVERAL OF THE BACK WINDOWS ON THE STAIRCASE HAD BEEN DARKENED OR WHOLLY BLOCKED UP IN THOSE THAT REMAINED THERE WAS SCARCELY ANY GLASS AND THROUGH THE CRUMBLING FRAMES BY WHICH THE BAD AIR SEEMED ALWAYS TO COME IN AND NEVER TO GO OUT I SAW THROUGH OTHER GLASSLESS WINDOWS INTO OTHER HOUSES IN A SIMILAR CONDITION AND LOOKED GIDDILY DOWN INTO A WRETCHED YARD WHICH WAS THE COMMON DUSTHEAP OF THE MANSION WE PROCEEDED TO THE TOPSTOREY OF THE HOUSE TWO OR THREE TIMES BY THE WAY I THOUGHT I OBSERVED IN THE INDISTINCT LIGHT THE SKIRTS OF A FEMALE FIGURE GOING UP BEFORE US AS WE TURNED TO ASCEND THE LAST FLIGHT OF STAIRS BETWEEN US AND THE ROOF WE CAUGHT A FULL VIEW OF THIS FIGURE PAUSING FOR A MOMENT AT A DOOR THEN IT TURNED THE HANDLE AND WENT IN WHATS THIS SAID MARTHA IN A WHISPER SHE HAS GONE INTO MY ROOM I DONT KNOW HER I KNEW HER I HAD RECOGNIZED HER WITH AMAZEMENT FOR MISS DARTLE I SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT IT WAS A LADY WHOM I HAD SEEN BEFORE IN A FEW WORDS TO MY CONDUCTRESS AND HAD SCARCELY DONE SO WHEN WE HEARD HER VOICE IN THE ROOM THOUGH NOT FROM WHERE WE STOOD WHAT SHE WAS SAYING MARTHA WITH AN ASTONISHED LOOK REPEATED HER FORMER ACTION AND SOFTLY LED ME UP THE STAIRS AND THEN BY A LITTLE BACKDOOR WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE NO LOCK AND WHICH SHE PUSHED OPEN WITH A TOUCH INTO A SMALL EMPTY GARRET WITH A LOW SLOPING ROOF LITTLE BETTER THAN A CUPBOARD BETWEEN THIS AND THE ROOM SHE HAD CALLED HERS THERE WAS A SMALL DOOR OF COMMUNICATION STANDING PARTLY OPEN HERE WE STOPPED BREATHLESS WITH OUR ASCENT AND SHE PLACED HER HAND LIGHTLY ON MY LIPS I COULD ONLY SEE OF THE ROOM BEYOND THAT IT WAS PRETTY LARGE THAT THERE WAS A BED IN IT AND THAT THERE WERE SOME COMMON PICTURES OF SHIPS UPON THE WALLS I COULD NOT SEE MISS DARTLE OR THE PERSON WHOM WE HAD HEARD HER ADDRESS CERTAINLY MY COMPANION COULD NOT FOR MY POSITION WAS THE BEST A DEAD SILENCE PREVAILED FOR SOME MOMENTS MARTHA KEPT ONE HAND ON MY LIPS AND RAISED THE OTHER IN A LISTENING ATTITUDE IT MATTERS LITTLE TO ME HER NOT BEING AT HOME SAID ROSA DARTLE HAUGHTILY I KNOW NOTHING OF HER IT IS YOU I COME TO SEE ME REPLIED A SOFT VOICE AT THE SOUND OF IT A THRILL WENT THROUGH MY FRAME FOR IT WAS EMILYS YES RETURNED MISS DARTLE I HAVE COME TO LOOK AT YOU WHAT YOU ARE NOT ASHAMED OF THE FACE THAT HAS DONE SO MUCH THE RESOLUTE AND UNRELENTING HATRED OF HER TONE ITS COLD STERN SHARPNESS AND ITS MASTERED RAGE PRESENTED HER BEFORE ME AS IF I HAD SEEN HER STANDING IN THE LIGHT I SAW THE FLASHING BLACK EYES AND THE PASSIONWASTED FIGURE AND I SAW THE SCAR WITH ITS WHITE TRACK CUTTING THROUGH HER LIPS QUIVERING AND THROBBING AS SHE SPOKE I HAVE COME TO SEE SHE SAID JAMES STEERFORTHS FANCY THE GIRL WHO RAN AWAY WITH HIM AND IS THE TOWNTALK OF THE COMMONEST PEOPLE OF HER NATIVE PLACE THE BOLD FLAUNTING PRACTISED COMPANION OF PERSONS LIKE JAMES STEERFORTH I WANT TO KNOW WHAT SUCH A THING IS LIKE THERE WAS A RUSTLE AS IF THE UNHAPPY GIRL ON WHOM SHE HEAPED THESE TAUNTS RAN TOWARDS THE DOOR AND THE SPEAKER SWIFTLY INTERPOSED HERSELF BEFORE IT IT WAS SUCCEEDED BY A MOMENTS PAUSE WHEN MISS DARTLE SPOKE AGAIN IT WAS THROUGH HER SET TEETH AND WITH A STAMP UPON THE GROUND STAY THERE SHE SAID OR ILL PROCLAIM YOU TO THE HOUSE AND THE WHOLE STREET IF YOU TRY TO EVADE ME ILL STOP YOU IF ITS BY THE HAIR AND RAISE THE VERY STONES AGAINST YOU A FRIGHTENED MURMUR WAS THE ONLY REPLY THAT REACHED MY EARS A SILENCE SUCCEEDED I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO MUCH AS I DESIRED TO PUT AN END TO THE INTERVIEW I FELT THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO PRESENT MYSELF

MORNING PUNCTUALLY AT HALF PAST NINE AFTER WHICH WE WENT SHIVERING AT THAT UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR TO OUR RESPECTIVE BEDS THROUGH VARIOUS CLOSE PASSAGES WHICH SMELT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN STEEPED FOR AGES IN A SOLUTION OF SOUP AND STABLES EARLY IN THE MORNING I SAUNTERED THROUGH THE DEAR OLD TRANQUIL STREETS AND AGAIN MINGLED WITH THE SHADOWS OF THE VENERABLE GATEWAYS AND CHURCHES THE ROOKS WERE SAILING ABOUT THE CATHEDRAL TOWERS AND THE TOWERS THEMSELVES OVERLOOKING MANY A LONG UNALTERED MILE OF THE RICH COUNTRY AND ITS PLEASANT STREAMS WERE CUTTING THE BRIGHT MORNING AIR AS IF THERE WERE NO SUCH THING AS CHANGE ON EARTH YET THE BELLS WHEN THEY SOUNDED TOLD ME SORROWFULLY OF CHANGE IN EVERYTHING TOLD ME OF THEIR OWN AGE AND MY PRETTY DORAS YOUTH AND OF THE MANY NEVER OLD WHO HAD LIVED AND LOVED AND DIED WHILE THE REVERBERATIONS OF THE BELLS HAD HUMMED THROUGH THE RUSTY ARMOUR OF THE BLACK PRINCE HANGING UP WITHIN AND MOTES UPON THE DEEP OF TIME HAD LOST THEMSELVES IN AIR AS CIRCLES DO IN WATER I LOOKED AT THE OLD HOUSE FROM THE CORNER OF THE STREET BUT DID NOT GO NEARER TO IT LEST BEING OBSERVED I MIGHT UNWITTINGLY DO ANY HARM TO THE DESIGN I HAD COME TO AID THE EARLY SUN WAS STRIKING EDGEWISE ON ITS GABLES AND LATTICEWINDOWS TOUCHING THEM WITH GOLD AND SOME BEAMS OF ITS OLD PEACE SEEMED TO TOUCH MY HEART I STROLLED INTO THE COUNTRY FOR AN HOUR OR SO AND THEN RETURNED BY THE MAIN STREET WHICH IN THE INTERVAL HAD SHAKEN OFF ITS LAST NIGHTS SLEEP AMONG THOSE WHO WERE STIRRING IN THE SHOPS I SAW MY ANCIENT ENEMY THE BUTCHER NOW ADVANCED TO TOPBOOTS AND A BABY AND IN BUSINESS FOR HIMSELF HE WAS NURSING THE BABY AND APPEARED TO BE A BENIGNANT MEMBER OF SOCIETY WE ALL BECAME VERY ANXIOUS AND IMPATIENT WHEN WE SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST AS IT APPROACHED NEARER AND NEARER

MY AUNT WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM TRADDLES SAT UPON THE SOFA AFFECTING TO READ THE PAPER WITH HIS EYES ON THE CEILING AND I LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW TO GIVE EARLY NOTICE OF MR MICAWBERS COMING NOR

HIS SERVILITY WAS FALSE AND ALL HIS PRETENCES KNAVISH AND HOLLOW I HAD HAD NO ADEQUATE CONCEPTION OF THE EXTENT OF HIS HYPOCRISY UNTIL I NOW SAW HIM WITH HIS MASK OFF THE SUDDENNESS WITH WHICH HE DROPPED IT WHEN HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS USELESS TO HIM THE MALICE INSOLENCE AND HATRED HE REVEALED THE LEER WITH WHICH HE EXULTED EVEN AT THIS MOMENT IN THE EVIL HE HAD DONEALL THIS TIME BEING DESPERATE TOO AND AT HIS WITS END FOR THE MEANS OF GETTING THE BETTER OF USTHOUGH PERFECTLY CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPERIENCE I HAD OF HIM AT FIRST TOOK EVEN ME BY SURPRISE WHO HAD KNOWN HIM SO LONG AND DISLIKED HIM SO HEARTILY I SAY NOTHING OF THE LOOK HE CONFERRED ON ME AS HE STOOD EYEING US ONE AFTER ANOTHER FOR I HAD ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HATED ME AND I REMEMBERED THE MARKS OF MY HAND UPON

TO ASPIRE TO ONE WHOSE VIRTUES HE COULD NEVER APPRECIATE OR CARE FOR I WAS SHOCKED BY THE MERE THOUGHT OF HER HAVING LIVED AN HOUR WITHIN SIGHT OF SUCH A MAN AFTER SOME RUBBING OF THE LOWER PART OF

WHAT MIGHT FOLLOW MR MICAWBER WHOSE IMPETUOSITY I HAD RESTRAINED THUS FAR WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY AND WHO HAD REPEATEDLY INTERPOSED WITH THE FIRST SYLLABLE OF SCOUNDREL WITHOUT GETTING TO THE SECOND NOW BURST FORWARD DREW THE RULER FROM HIS BREAST APPARENTLY AS A DEFENSIVE WEAPON AND PRODUCED FROM HIS POCKET A FOOLSCAP DOCUMENT FOLDED IN THE FORM OF A LARGE LETTER OPENING THIS PACKET WITH HIS OLD FLOURISH AND GLANCING AT THE CONTENTS AS IF HE CHERISHED AN ARTISTIC ADMIRATION OF THEIR STYLE OF COMPOSITION HE BEGAN TO READ AS FOLLOWS DEAR MISS TROTWOOD AND GENTLEMEN BLESS AND SAVE THE MAN EXCLAIMED MY AUNT IN A LOW VOICE HED WRITE LETTERS BY THE REAM IF IT WAS A CAPITAL OFFENCE MR MICAWBER WITHOUT HEARING HER WENT ON IN APPEARING BEFORE YOU TO DENOUNCE PROBABLY THE MOST CONSUMMATE VILLAIN THAT HAS EVER EXISTED MR MICAWBER WITHOUT LOOKING OFF THE LETTER POINTED THE RULER LIKE A GHOSTLY TRUNCHEON AT URIAH HEEP I ASK NO CONSIDERATION FOR MYSELF THE VICTIM FROM MY CRADLE OF PECUNIARY LIABILITIES TO WHICH I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RESPOND I HAVE EVER BEEN THE SPORT AND TOY OF DEBASING CIRCUMSTANCES IGNOMINY WANT DESPAIR AND MADNESS HAVE COLLECTIVELY OR SEPARATELY BEEN THE ATTENDANTS OF MY CAREER THE RELISH WITH WHICH MR MICAWBER DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS A PREY TO THESE DISMAL CALAMITIES WAS ONLY TO BE EQUALLED BY THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE READ HIS LETTER AND THE KIND OF HOMAGE HE RENDERED TO IT WITH A ROLL OF HIS HEAD WHEN HE THOUGHT HE HAD HIT A SENTENCE VERY HARD INDEED IN AN ACCUMULATION OF IGNOMINY WANT DESPAIR AND MADNESS I ENTERED THE OFFICEOR AS OUR LIVELY NEIGHBOUR THE GAUL WOULD TERM IT THE BUREAUOF THE FIRM NOMINALLY CONDUCTED UNDER THE APPELLATION OF WICKFIELD ANDHEEP BUT IN REALITY WIELDED BYHEEP ALONE HEEP AND ONLY HEEP IS THE MAINSPRING OF THAT MACHINE HEEP AND ONLY HEEP IS THE FORGER AND THE CHEAT URIAH MORE BLUE THAN WHITE AT THESE WORDS MADE A DART AT THE LETTER AS IF TO TEAR IT IN PIECES MR MICAWBER WITH A PERFECT MIRACLE OF DEXTERITY OR LUCK CAUGHT HIS ADVANCING KNUCKLES WITH THE RULER AND DISABLED HIS RIGHT HAND IT DROPPED AT THE WRIST AS IF IT WERE BROKEN THE BLOW SOUNDED AS IF IT HAD FALLEN ON WOOD THE DEVIL TAKE YOU SAID URIAH WRITHING IN A NEW WAY WITH PAIN ILL BE EVEN WITH YOU APPROACH ME AGAIN YOUYOUYOU HEEP OF INFAMY GASPED MR MICAWBER AND IF YOUR HEAD IS HUMAN ILL BREAK IT COME ON COME ON I THINK I NEVER SAW ANYTHING MORE RIDICULOUSI WAS SENSIBLE OF IT EVEN AT THE TIMETHAN MR MICAWBER MAKING BROADSWORD GUARDS WITH THE RULER AND CRYING COME ON WHILE TRADDLES AND I PUSHED HIM BACK INTO A CORNER FROM WHICH AS OFTEN AS WE GOT HIM INTO IT HE PERSISTED IN EMERGING AGAIN HIS ENEMY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AFTER WRINGING HIS WOUNDED HAND FOR SOMETIME SLOWLY DREW OFF HIS NECKKERCHIEF AND BOUND IT UP THEN HELD IT IN HIS OTHER HAND AND SAT UPON HIS TABLE WITH HIS SULLEN FACE LOOKING DOWN MR MICAWBER WHEN HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY COOL PROCEEDED WITH HIS LETTER THE STIPENDIARY EMOLUMENTS IN CONSIDERATION OF WHICH I ENTERED INTO THE SERVICE OFHEEP ALWAYS PAUSING BEFORE THAT WORD AND UTTERING IT WITH ASTONISHING VIGOUR WERE NOT DEFINED BEYOND THE PITTANCE OF TWENTYTWO SHILLINGS AND SIX PER WEEK THE REST WAS LEFT CONTINGENT ON THE VALUE OF MY PROFESSIONAL EXERTIONS IN OTHER AND MORE EXPRESSIVE WORDS ON THE BASENESS OF MY NATURE THE CUPIDITY OF MY MOTIVES THE POVERTY OF MY FAMILY THE GENERAL MORAL OR RATHER IMMORAL RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN MYSELF ANDHEEP NEED I SAY THAT IT SOON BECAME NECESSARY FOR ME TO SOLICIT FROMHEEPPECUNIARY ADVANCES TOWARDS THE SUPPORT OF MRS MICAWBER AND OUR BLIGHTED BUT RISING FAMILY

BECAME IMMESHED IN THE WEB HE HAD SPUN FOR MY RECEPTION MR MICAWBERS ENJOYMENT OF HIS EPISTOLARY POWERS IN DESCRIBING THIS UNFORTUNATE STATE OF THINGS REALLY SEEMED TO OUTWEIGH ANY PAIN OR ANXIETY THAT THE REALITY COULD HAVE CAUSED HIM HE READ ON THEN IT WAS THATHEEPBEGAN TO FAVOUR ME WITH JUST SO MUCH OF HIS CONFIDENCE AS WAS NECESSARY TO THE DISCHARGE OF HIS INFERNAL BUSINESS THEN IT WAS THAT I BEGAN IF I MAY SO SHAKESPEARIANLY EXPRESS MYSELF TO DWINDLE PEAK AND PINE I FOUND THAT MY SERVICES WERE CONSTANTLY CALLED INTO REQUISITION FOR THE FALSIFICATION OF BUSINESS AND THE MYSTIFICATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHOM I WILL DESIGNATE AS MR W THAT MR W WAS IMPOSED UPON KEPT IN IGNORANCE AND DELUDED IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY YET THAT ALL THIS WHILE THE RUFFIANHEEPWAS PROFESSING UNBOUNDED GRATITUDE TO AND UNBOUNDED FRIENDSHIP FOR THAT MUCHABUSED GENTLEMAN THIS WAS BAD ENOUGH BUT AS THE PHILOSOPHIC DANE OBSERVES WITH THAT UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE ILLUSTRIOUS ORNAMENT OF THE ELIZABETHAN ERA WORSE REMAINS BEHIND MR MICAWBER WAS SO VERY MUCH STRUCK BY THIS HAPPY ROUNDING OFF WITH A QUOTATION THAT HE INDULGED HIMSELF AND US WITH A SECOND READING OF THE SENTENCE UNDER PRETENCE OF HAVING LOST HIS PLACE IT IS NOT MY INTENTION HE CONTINUED READING ON TO ENTER ON A DETAILED LIST WITHIN THE COMPASS OF THE PRESENT EPISTLE THOUGH IT IS READY ELSEWHERE OF THE VARIOUS MALPRACTICES OF A MINOR NATURE AFFECTING THE INDIVIDUAL WHOM I HAVE DENOMINATED MR W TO WHICH I HAVE BEEN A TACITLY CONSENTING PARTY MY OBJECT WHEN THE CONTEST WITHIN MYSELF BETWEEN STIPEND AND NO STIPEND BAKER AND NO BAKER EXISTENCE AND NONEXISTENCE CEASED WAS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MY OPPORTUNITIES TO DISCOVER AND EXPOSE THE MAJOR MALPRACTICES COMMITTED TO THAT GENTLEMANS GRIEVOUS WRONG AND INJURY BYHEEP STIMULATED BY THE SILENT MONITOR WITHIN AND BY A NO LESS TOUCHING AND APPEALING MONITOR WITHOUTTO WHOM I WILL BRIEFLY REFER AS MISS WI ENTERED ON A NOT UNLABORIOUS TASK OF CLANDESTINE INVESTIGATION PROTRACTEDNOW TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE INFORMATION AND BELIEF OVER A PERIOD EXCEEDING TWELVE CALENDAR MONTHS HE READ THIS PASSAGE AS IF IT WERE FROM AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT AND APPEARED MAJESTICALLY REFRESHED BY THE SOUND OF THE WORDS MY CHARGES AGAINSTHEEP HE READ ON GLANCING AT HIM AND DRAWING THE RULER INTO A CONVENIENT POSITION UNDER HIS LEFT ARM IN CASE OF NEED ARE AS FOLLOWS WE ALL HELD OUR BREATH I THINK I AM SURE URIAH HELD HIS FIRST SAID MR MICAWBER WHEN MR WS FACULTIES AND MEMORY FOR BUSINESS BECAME THROUGH CAUSES INTO WHICH IT IS NOT NECESSARY OR EXPEDIENT FOR ME TO ENTER WEAKENED AND CONFUSEDHEEPDESIGNEDLY PERPLEXED AND COMPLICATED THE WHOLE OF THE OFFICIAL TRANSACTIONS WHEN MR W WAS LEAST FIT TO ENTER ON BUSINESSHEEP WAS ALWAYS AT HAND TO FORCE HIM TO ENTER ON IT HE OBTAINED MR WS SIGNATURE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES TO DOCUMENTS OF IMPORTANCE REPRESENTING THEM TO BE OTHER DOCUMENTS OF NO IMPORTANCE HE INDUCED MR W TO EMPOWER HIM TO DRAW OUT THUS ONE PARTICULAR SUM OF TRUSTMONEY AMOUNTING TO TWELVE SIX FOURTEEN TWO AND NINE AND EMPLOYED IT TO MEET PRETENDED BUSINESS CHARGES AND DEFICIENCIES WHICH WERE EITHER ALREADY PROVIDED FOR OR HAD NEVER REALLY EXISTED HE GAVE THIS PROCEEDING THROUGHOUT THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING ORIGINATED IN MR WS OWN DISHONEST INTENTION AND OF HAVING BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY MR WS OWN DISHONEST ACT AND HAS USED IT EVER SINCE TO TORTURE AND CONSTRAIN HIM YOU SHALL PROVE THIS YOU COPPERFIELD SAID URIAH WITH A THREATENING SHAKE OF THE HEAD ALL IN GOOD TIME ASKHEEPMR TRADDLES WHO LIVED IN HIS HOUSE AFTER HIM SAID MR MICAWBER BREAKING OFF FROM THE LETTER WILL YOU THE FOOL HIMSELFAND LIVES THERE NOW SAID URIAH DISDAINFULLY ASKHEEPIF HE EVER KEPT A POCKETBOOK IN THAT HOUSE SAID MR MICAWBER WILL YOU I SAW URIAHS LANK HAND STOP INVOLUNTARILY IN THE SCRAPING OF HIS CHIN OR ASK HIM SAID MR MICAWBER IF HE EVER BURNT ONE THERE IF HE SAYS YES AND ASKS YOU WHERE THE ASHES ARE REFER HIM TO WILKINS MICAWBER AND HE WILL HEAR OF SOMETHING NOT AT ALL TO HIS ADVANTAGE THE TRIUMPHANT FLOURISH WITH WHICH MR MICAWBER DELIVERED HIMSELF OF THESE WORDS HAD A POWERFUL EFFECT IN ALARMING THE MOTHER WHO CRIED OUT IN MUCH AGITATION URY URY BE UMBLE AND MAKE TERMS MY DEAR MOTHER HE RETORTED WILL YOU KEEP QUIET YOURE IN A FRIGHT AND DONT KNOW WHAT YOU SAY OR MEAN UMBLE HE REPEATED LOOKING AT ME WITH A SNARL IVE UMBLED SOME OF EM FOR A PRETTY LONG TIME BACK UMBLE AS I WAS MR MICAWBER GENTEELLY ADJUSTING HIS CHIN IN HIS CRAVAT PRESENTLY PROCEEDED WITH HIS COMPOSITION SECOND HEEP HAS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE INFORMATION AND BELIEF BUT THAT WONT DO MUTTERED URIAH RELIEVED MOTHER YOU KEEP QUIET WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO PROVIDE SOMETHING THAT WILL DO AND DO FOR YOU FINALLY SIR VERY SHORTLY REPLIED MR MICAWBER SECOND HEEP HAS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE INFORMATION AND BELIEF SYSTEMATICALLY FORGED TO VARIOUS ENTRIES BOOKS AND DOCUMENTS THE SIGNATURE OF MR W AND HAS DISTINCTLY DONE SO IN ONE INSTANCE CAPABLE OF PROOF BY ME TO WIT IN MANNER FOLLOWING THAT IS TO SAY AGAIN MR MICAWBER HAD A RELISH IN THIS FORMAL PILING UP OF WORDS WHICH HOWEVER LUDICROUSLY DISPLAYED IN HIS CASE WAS I MUST SAY NOT AT ALL PECULIAR TO HIM I HAVE OBSERVED IT IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFE IN NUMBERS OF MEN IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A GENERAL RULE IN THE TAKING OF LEGAL OATHS FOR INSTANCE DEPONENTS SEEM TO ENJOY THEMSELVES MIGHTILY WHEN THEY COME TO SEVERAL GOOD WORDS IN SUCCESSION FOR THE EXPRESSION OF ONE IDEA AS THAT THEY UTTERLY DETEST ABOMINATE AND ABJURE OR SO FORTH AND THE OLD ANATHEMAS WERE MADE RELISHING ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE WE TALK ABOUT THE TYRANNY OF WORDS BUT WE LIKE TO TYRANNIZE OVER THEM TOO WE ARE FOND OF HAVING A LARGE SUPERFLUOUS ESTABLISHMENT OF WORDS TO WAIT UPON US ON GREAT OCCASIONS WE THINK IT LOOKS IMPORTANT AND SOUNDS WELL AS WE ARE NOT PARTICULAR ABOUT THE MEANING OF OUR LIVERIES ON STATE OCCASIONS IF THEY BE BUT FINE AND NUMEROUS ENOUGH SO THE MEANING OR NECESSITY OF OUR WORDS IS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IF THERE BE BUT A GREAT PARADE OF THEM AND AS INDIVIDUALS GET INTO TROUBLE BY MAKING TOO GREAT A SHOW OF LIVERIES OR AS SLAVES WHEN THEY ARE TOO NUMEROUS RISE AGAINST THEIR MASTERS SO I THINK I COULD MENTION A NATION THAT HAS GOT INTO MANY GREAT DIFFICULTIES AND WILL GET INTO MANY GREATER FROM MAINTAINING TOO LARGE A RETINUE OF WORDS MR MICAWBER READ ON ALMOST SMACKING HIS LIPS TO WIT IN MANNER FOLLOWING THAT IS TO SAY MR W BEING INFIRM AND IT BEING WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF PROBABILITY THAT HIS DECEASE MIGHT LEAD TO SOME DISCOVERIES AND TO THE DOWNFALL OFHEEPSPOWER OVER THE W FAMILYAS I WILKINS MICAWBER THE UNDERSIGNED ASSUMEUNLESS THE FILIAL AFFECTION OF HIS DAUGHTER COULD BE SECRETLY INFLUENCED FROM ALLOWING ANY INVESTIGATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP AFFAIRS TO BE EVER MADE THE SAIDHEEPDEEMED IT EXPEDIENT TO HAVE A BOND READY BY HIM AS FROM MR W FOR THE BEFOREMENTIONED SUM OF TWELVE SIX FOURTEEN TWO AND NINE WITH INTEREST STATED THEREIN TO HAVE BEEN ADVANCED BYHEEPTO MR W TO SAVE MR W FROM DISHONOUR THOUGH REALLY THE SUM WAS NEVER ADVANCED BY HIM AND HAS LONG BEEN REPLACED THE SIGNATURES TO THIS INSTRUMENT PURPORTING TO BE EXECUTED BY MR W AND ATTESTED BY WILKINS MICAWBER ARE FORGERIES BYHEEP I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION IN HIS HAND AND POCKETBOOK SEVERAL SIMILAR IMITATIONS OF MR WS SIGNATURE HERE AND THERE DEFACED BY FIRE BUT LEGIBLE TO ANYONE I NEVER ATTESTED ANY SUCH DOCUMENT AND I HAVE THE DOCUMENT ITSELF IN MY POSSESSION URIAH HEEP WITH A START TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET A BUNCH OF KEYS AND OPENED A CERTAIN DRAWER THEN SUDDENLY BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF WHAT HE WAS ABOUT AND TURNED AGAIN TOWARDS US WITHOUT LOOKING IN IT AND I HAVE THE DOCUMENT MR MICAWBER READ AGAIN LOOKING ABOUT AS IF IT WERE THE TEXT OF A SERMON IN MY POSSESSIONTHAT IS TO SAY I HAD EARLY THIS MORNING WHEN THIS WAS WRITTEN BUT HAVE SINCE RELINQUISHED IT TO MR TRADDLES IT IS QUITE TRUE ASSENTED TRADDLES URY URY CRIED THE MOTHER BE UMBLE AND MAKE TERMS I KNOW MY SON WILL BE UMBLE GENTLEMEN IF YOULL GIVE HIM TIME TO THINK MR COPPERFIELD IM SURE YOU KNOW THAT HE WAS ALWAYS VERY UMBLE SIR IT WAS SINGULAR TO SEE HOW THE MOTHER STILL HELD TO THE OLD TRICK WHEN THE SON HAD ABANDONED IT AS USELESS MOTHER HE SAID WITH AN IMPATIENT BITE AT THE HANDKERCHIEF IN WHICH HIS HAND WAS WRAPPED YOU HAD BETTER TAKE AND FIRE A LOADED GUN AT ME BUT I LOVE YOU URY CRIED MRS HEEP AND I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE DID OR THAT HE LOVED HER HOWEVER STRANGE IT MAY APPEAR THOUGH TO BE SURE THEY WERE A CONGENIAL COUPLE AND I CANT BEAR TO HEAR YOU PROVOKING THE GENTLEMEN AND ENDANGERING OF YOURSELF MORE I TOLD THE GENTLEMAN AT FIRST WHEN HE TOLD ME UPSTAIRS IT WAS COME TO LIGHT THAT I WOULD ANSWER FOR YOUR BEING UMBLE AND MAKING AMENDS OH SEE HOW UMBLE I AM GENTLEMEN AND DONT MIND HIM WHY THERES COPPERFIELD MOTHER HE ANGRILY RETORTED POINTING HIS LEAN FINGER AT ME AGAINST WHOM ALL HIS ANIMOSITY WAS LEVELLED AS THE PRIME MOVER IN THE DISCOVERY AND I DID NOT UNDECEIVE HIM THERES COPPERFIELD WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU A HUNDRED POUND TO SAY LESS THAN YOUVE BLURTED OUT I CANT HELP IT URY CRIED HIS MOTHER I CANT SEE YOU RUNNING INTO DANGER THROUGH CARRYING YOUR HEAD SO HIGH BETTER BE UMBLE AS YOU ALWAYS WAS HE REMAINED FOR A LITTLE BITING THE HANDKERCHIEF AND THEN SAID TO ME WITH A SCOWL WHAT MORE HAVE YOU GOT TO BRING FORWARD IF ANYTHING GO ON WITH IT WHAT DO YOU LOOK AT ME FOR MR MICAWBER PROMPTLY RESUMED HIS LETTER GLAD TO REVERT TO A PERFORMANCE WITH WHICH HE WAS SO HIGHLY SATISFIED THIRD AND LAST I AM NOW IN A CONDITION TO SHOW BYHEEPSFALSE BOOKS ANDHEEPSREAL MEMORANDA BEGINNING WITH THE PARTIALLY DESTROYED POCKETBOOK WHICH I WAS UNABLE TO COMPREHEND AT THE TIME OF ITS ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY BY MRS MICAWBER ON OUR TAKING POSSESSION OF OUR PRESENT ABODE IN THE LOCKER OR BIN DEVOTED TO THE RECEPTION OF THE ASHES CALCINED ON OUR DOMESTIC HEARTH THAT THE WEAKNESSES THE FAULTS THE VERY VIRTUES THE PARENTAL AFFECTIONS AND THE SENSE OF HONOUR OF THE UNHAPPY MR W HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS ACTED ON BY AND WARPED TO THE BASE PURPOSES OFHEEP THAT MR W HAS BEEN FOR YEARS DELUDED AND PLUNDERED IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE MANNER TO THE PECUNIARY AGGRANDISEMENT OF THE AVARICIOUS FALSE AND GRASPINGHEEP THAT THE ENGROSSING OBJECT OFHEEPWAS NEXT TO GAIN TO SUBDUE MR AND MISS W OF HIS ULTERIOR VIEWS IN REFERENCE TO THE LATTER I SAY NOTHING ENTIRELY TO HIMSELF THAT HIS LAST ACT COMPLETED BUT A FEW MONTHS SINCE WAS TO INDUCE MR W TO EXECUTE A RELINQUISHMENT OF HIS SHARE IN THE PARTNERSHIP AND EVEN A BILL OF SALE ON THE VERY FURNITURE OF HIS HOUSE IN CONSIDERATION OF A CERTAIN ANNUITY TO BE WELL AND TRULY PAID BYHEEPON THE FOUR COMMON QUARTERDAYS IN EACH AND EVERY YEAR THAT THESE MESHES BEGINNING WITH ALARMING AND FALSIFIED ACCOUNTS OF THE ESTATE OF WHICH MR W IS THE RECEIVER AT A PERIOD WHEN MR W HAD LAUNCHED INTO IMPRUDENT AND ILLJUDGED SPECULATIONS AND MAY NOT HAVE HAD THE MONEY FOR WHICH HE WAS MORALLY AND LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE IN HAND GOING ON WITH PRETENDED BORROWINGS OF MONEY AT ENORMOUS INTEREST REALLY COMING FROMHEEPAND BYHEEPFRAUDULENTLY OBTAINED OR WITHHELD FROM MR W HIMSELF ON PRETENCE OF SUCH SPECULATIONS OR OTHERWISE PERPETUATED BY A MISCELLANEOUS CATALOGUE OF UNSCRUPULOUS CHICANERIESGRADUALLY THICKENED UNTIL THE UNHAPPY MR W COULD SEE NO WORLD BEYOND BANKRUPT AS HE BELIEVED ALIKE IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN ALL OTHER HOPE AND IN HONOUR HIS SOLE RELIANCE WAS UPON THE MONSTER IN THE GARB OF MANMR MICAWBER MADE A GOOD DEAL OF THIS AS A NEW TURN OF EXPRESSIONWHO BY MAKING HIMSELF NECESSARY TO HIM HAD ACHIEVED HIS DESTRUCTION ALL THIS I UNDERTAKE TO SHOW PROBABLY MUCH MORE I WHISPERED A FEW WORDS TO AGNES WHO WAS WEEPING HALF JOYFULLY HALF SORROWFULLY AT MY SIDE AND THERE WAS A MOVEMENT AMONG US AS IF MR MICAWBER HAD FINISHED HE SAID WITH EXCEEDING GRAVITY PARDON ME AND PROCEEDED WITH A MIXTURE OF THE LOWEST SPIRITS AND THE MOST INTENSE ENJOYMENT TO THE PERORATION OF HIS LETTER I HAVE NOW CONCLUDED IT MERELY REMAINS FOR ME TO SUBSTANTIATE THESE ACCUSATIONS AND THEN WITH MY ILLSTARRED FAMILY TO DISAPPEAR FROM THE LANDSCAPE ON WHICH WE APPEAR TO BE AN ENCUMBRANCE THAT IS SOON DONE IT MAY BE REASONABLY INFERRED THAT OUR BABY WILL FIRST EXPIRE OF INANITION AS BEING THE FRAILEST MEMBER OF OUR CIRCLE AND THAT OUR TWINS WILL FOLLOW NEXT IN ORDER SO BE IT FOR MYSELF MY CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE HAS DONE MUCH IMPRISONMENT ON CIVIL PROCESS AND WANT WILL SOON DO MORE I TRUST THAT THE LABOUR AND HAZARD OF AN INVESTIGATIONOF WHICH THE SMALLEST RESULTS HAVE BEEN SLOWLY PIECED TOGETHER IN THE PRESSURE OF ARDUOUS AVOCATIONS UNDER GRINDING PENURIOUS APPREHENSIONS AT RISE OF MORN AT DEWY EVE IN THE SHADOWS OF NIGHT UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF ONE WHOM IT WERE SUPERFLUOUS TO CALL DEMONCOMBINED WITH THE STRUGGLE OF PARENTAL POVERTY TO TURN IT WHEN COMPLETED TO THE RIGHT ACCOUNT MAY BE AS THE SPRINKLING OF A FEW DROPS OF SWEET WATER ON MY FUNERAL PYRE I ASK NO MORE LET IT BE IN JUSTICE MERELY

ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME AND PROFFERED ME THE SATISFACTION OF WITNESSING THE REESTABLISHMENT OF MUTUAL CONFIDENCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MRS MICAWBER AFTER WHICH HE INVITED THE COMPANY GENERALLY TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF THAT AFFECTING SPECTACLE THE VEIL THAT HAS LONG BEEN INTERPOSED BETWEEN MRS MICAWBER AND MYSELF IS NOW WITHDRAWN SAID MR MICAWBER AND MY CHILDREN AND THE AUTHOR OF THEIR BEING CAN ONCE MORE COME IN CONTACT ON EQUAL TERMS AS WE WERE ALL VERY GRATEFUL TO HIM AND ALL DESIROUS TO SHOW THAT WE WERE AS WELL AS THE HURRY AND DISORDER OF OUR SPIRITS WOULD PERMIT I DARE SAY WE SHOULD

THE LATTER PURPOSE TO BE PRESENTLY RELIEVED BY MR DICK AND MR DICK MY AUNT AND I WENT HOME WITH MR MICAWBER AS I PARTED HURRIEDLY FROM THE DEAR GIRL TO WHOM I OWED SO MUCH AND THOUGHT FROM WHAT SHE

NOT FAR OFF AND AS THE STREET DOOR OPENED INTO THE SITTINGROOM AND HE BOLTED IN WITH A PRECIPITATION QUITE HIS OWN WE FOUND OURSELVES AT ONCE IN THE BOSOM OF THE FAMILY MR MICAWBER EXCLAIMING EMMA MY LIFE RUSHED INTO MRS MICAWBERS ARMS MRS MICAWBER SHRIEKED AND FOLDED MR MICAWBER IN HER EMBRACE MISS MICAWBER NURSING THE UNCONSCIOUS STRANGER OF MRS MICAWBERS LAST LETTER TO ME WAS SENSIBLY AFFECTED THE STRANGER LEAPED THE TWINS TESTIFIED THEIR JOY BY SEVERAL INCONVENIENT BUT INNOCENT DEMONSTRATIONS MASTER MICAWBER WHOSE DISPOSITION APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN SOURED BY EARLY DISAPPOINTMENT AND WHOSE ASPECT HAD BECOME MOROSE YIELDED TO HIS BETTER FEELINGS AND BLUBBERED EMMA SAID MR MICAWBER THE CLOUD IS PAST FROM MY MIND MUTUAL CONFIDENCE SO LONG PRESERVED BETWEEN US ONCE IS RESTORED TO KNOW NO FURTHER INTERRUPTION NOW WELCOME POVERTY CRIED MR MICAWBER SHEDDING TEARS WELCOME MISERY WELCOME HOUSELESSNESS WELCOME HUNGER RAGS TEMPEST AND BEGGARY MUTUAL CONFIDENCE WILL SUSTAIN US TO THE END WITH THESE EXPRESSIONS MR MICAWBER PLACED MRS MICAWBER IN A CHAIR AND EMBRACED THE FAMILY ALL ROUND WELCOMING A VARIETY OF BLEAK PROSPECTS WHICH APPEARED TO THE BEST OF MY JUDGEMENT TO BE ANYTHING BUT WELCOME TO THEM AND CALLING UPON THEM TO COME OUT INTO CANTERBURY AND SING A CHORUS AS NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT FOR THEIR SUPPORT BUT MRS MICAWBER HAVING IN THE STRENGTH OF HER EMOTIONS FAINTED AWAY THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE EVEN BEFORE THE CHORUS COULD BE CONSIDERED COMPLETE WAS TO RECOVER HER THIS MY AUNT AND MR MICAWBER DID AND THEN MY AUNT WAS INTRODUCED AND MRS MICAWBER RECOGNIZED ME EXCUSE ME DEAR MR COPPERFIELD SAID THE POOR LADY GIVING ME HER HAND BUT I AM NOT STRONG AND THE REMOVAL OF THE LATE MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN MR MICAWBER AND MYSELF WAS AT FIRST TOO MUCH FOR ME IS THIS ALL YOUR

THAT ELDEST YOUNG GENTLEMAN NOW SAID MY AUNT MUSING WHAT HAS HE BEEN BROUGHT UP TO IT WAS MY HOPE WHEN I CAME HERE SAID MR MICAWBER TO HAVE GOT WILKINS INTO THE CHURCH OR PERHAPS I SHALL EXPRESS MY MEANING MORE STRICTLY IF I SAY THE CHOIR BUT THERE WAS NO VACANCY FOR A TENOR IN THE VENERABLE PILE FOR WHICH THIS CITY IS SO JUSTLY EMINENT AND HE HASIN SHORT HE HAS CONTRACTED A HABIT OF SINGING IN PUBLICHOUSES RATHER THAN IN SACRED EDIFICES BUT HE MEANS WELL SAID MRS MICAWBER TENDERLY I DARE SAY MY LOVE REJOINED MR MICAWBER THAT HE MEANS PARTICULARLY WELL BUT I HAVE NOT YET FOUND THAT HE CARRIES OUT HIS MEANING IN ANY GIVEN DIRECTION WHATSOEVER MASTER MICAWBERS MOROSENESS OF ASPECT RETURNED UPON HIM AGAIN AND HE DEMANDED WITH SOME TEMPER WHAT HE WAS TO DO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN BORN A CARPENTER OR A COACHPAINTER ANY MORE THAN HE HAD BEEN BORN A BIRD WHETHER HE COULD GO INTO THE NEXT STREET AND OPEN A CHEMISTS SHOP WHETHER HE COULD RUSH TO THE NEXT ASSIZES AND PROCLAIM HIMSELF A LAWYER WHETHER HE COULD COME OUT BY FORCE AT THE OPERA AND SUCCEED BY VIOLENCE WHETHER HE COULD DO ANYTHING WITHOUT BEING BROUGHT UP TO SOMETHING MY AUNT MUSED A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID MR MICAWBER I WONDER YOU HAVE NEVER TURNED YOUR THOUGHTS TO EMIGRATION MADAM RETURNED MR MICAWBER IT WAS THE DREAM OF MY YOUTH AND THE FALLACIOUS ASPIRATION OF MY RIPER YEARS I AM THOROUGHLY PERSUADED BY THE BY

KNOWS GOING OUT TO AUSTRALIA SHORTLY IF YOU DECIDE TO GO WHY SHOULDNT YOU GO IN THE SAME SHIP YOU MAY HELP EACH OTHER THINK OF THIS NOW MR AND MRS MICAWBER TAKE YOUR TIME AND WEIGH IT WELL THERE IS BUT ONE QUESTION MY DEAR MAAM I COULD WISH TO ASK SAID MRS MICAWBER THE CLIMATE I BELIEVE IS HEALTHY FINEST IN THE WORLD SAID MY AUNT JUST SO RETURNED MRS MICAWBER THEN MY QUESTION ARISES NOW ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COUNTRY SUCH THAT A MAN OF MR MICAWBERS ABILITIES WOULD HAVE A FAIR CHANCE OF RISING IN THE SOCIAL SCALE I WILL NOT SAY AT PRESENT MIGHT HE ASPIRE TO BE GOVERNOR OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT BUT WOULD THERE BE A REASONABLE OPENING FOR HIS TALENTS TO DEVELOP THEMSELVESTHAT WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENTAND FIND THEIR OWN EXPANSION NO BETTER OPENING ANYWHERE SAID MY AUNT FOR A MAN WHO CONDUCTS HIMSELF WELL AND IS INDUSTRIOUS FOR A MAN WHO CONDUCTS HIMSELF WELL REPEATED MRS MICAWBER WITH HER CLEAREST BUSINESS MANNER AND IS INDUSTRIOUS PRECISELY IT IS EVIDENT TO ME THAT AUSTRALIA IS THE LEGITIMATE SPHERE OF ACTION FOR MR MICAWBER I ENTERTAIN THE CONVICTION MY DEAR MADAM SAID MR MICAWBER THAT IT IS UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES THE LAND THE ONLY LAND FOR MYSELF AND FAMILY AND THAT SOMETHING OF AN EXTRAORDINARY NATURE WILL TURN UP ON THAT SHORE IT IS NO DISTANCECOMPARATIVELY SPEAKING AND THOUGH CONSIDERATION IS DUE TO THE KINDNESS OF YOUR PROPOSAL I ASSURE YOU THAT IS A MERE MATTER OF FORM SHALL I EVER FORGET HOW IN A MOMENT HE WAS THE MOST SANGUINE OF MEN LOOKING ON TO FORTUNE OR HOW MRS MICAWBER PRESENTLY DISCOURSED ABOUT THE HABITS OF THE KANGAROO SHALL I EVER RECALL THAT STREET OF CANTERBURY ON A MARKETDAY WITHOUT RECALLING HIM AS HE WALKED BACK WITH US EXPRESSING IN THE HARDY ROVING MANNER HE ASSUMED THE UNSETTLED HABITS OF A TEMPORARY SOJOURNER IN THE LAND AND LOOKING AT THE BULLOCKS AS THEY CAME BY WITH THE EYE OF AN AUSTRALIAN FARMER CHAPTER ANOTHER RETROSPECT I MUST PAUSE YET ONCE AGAIN O MY CHILDWIFE THERE IS A FIGURE IN THE MOVING CROWD BEFORE MY

QUERULOUSLY TRYING TO SLEEP THE BRIGHT MOON IS HIGH AND CLEAR AS I LOOK OUT ON THE NIGHT MY TEARS FALL FAST AND MY UNDISCIPLINED HEART IS CHASTENED HEAVILYHEAVILY I SIT DOWN BY THE FIRE THINKING WITH A BLIND REMORSE OF ALL THOSE SECRET FEELINGS I HAVE NOURISHED SINCE MY MARRIAGE I THINK OF EVERY LITTLE TRIFLE BETWEEN ME AND DORA AND FEEL THE TRUTH THAT TRIFLES MAKE THE SUM OF LIFE EVER RISING FROM THE SEA OF MY REMEMBRANCE IS THE IMAGE OF THE DEAR CHILD AS I KNEW HER FIRST GRACED BY MY YOUNG LOVE AND BY HER OWN WITH EVERY FASCINATION WHEREIN SUCH LOVE IS RICH WOULD IT INDEED HAVE BEEN BETTER IF

TEARS THAT AWFUL MUTE APPEAL TO ME THAT SOLEMN HAND UPRAISED TOWARDS HEAVEN AGNES IT IS OVER DARKNESS COMES BEFORE MY EYES AND FOR A TIME ALL THINGS ARE BLOTTED OUT OF MY REMEMBRANCE CHAPTER MR MICAWBERS TRANSACTIONS THIS IS NOT THE TIME AT WHICH I AM TO ENTER ON THE STATE OF MY MIND BENEATH ITS LOAD OF SORROW I CAME TO THINK THAT THE FUTURE WAS WALLED UP BEFORE ME THAT THE ENERGY AND ACTION OF MY LIFE WERE AT AN END THAT I NEVER COULD FIND ANY REFUGE BUT IN THE GRAVE I CAME TO THINK SO I SAY BUT NOT IN THE FIRST SHOCK OF MY GRIEF IT SLOWLY GREW TO THAT IF THE EVENTS I GO ON TO RELATE HAD NOT THICKENED AROUND ME IN THE BEGINNING TO CONFUSE AND IN THE END TO AUGMENT MY AFFLICTION IT IS POSSIBLE THOUGH I THINK NOT PROBABLE THAT I MIGHT HAVE FALLEN AT ONCE INTO THIS CONDITION AS IT WAS AN INTERVAL OCCURRED BEFORE I FULLY KNEW MY OWN DISTRESS AN INTERVAL IN WHICH I EVEN SUPPOSED THAT ITS SHARPEST PANGS WERE PAST AND WHEN MY MIND COULD SOOTHE ITSELF BY RESTING ON ALL THAT WAS MOST INNOCENT AND BEAUTIFUL IN THE TENDER STORY THAT WAS CLOSED FOR EVER WHEN IT WAS FIRST PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD GO ABROAD OR HOW IT CAME TO BE AGREED AMONG US THAT I WAS TO SEEK THE RESTORATION OF MY PEACE IN CHANGE AND TRAVEL I DO NOT EVEN NOW DISTINCTLY KNOW THE SPIRIT OF AGNES SO PERVADED ALL WE THOUGHT AND SAID AND DID IN THAT TIME OF SORROW THAT I ASSUME I MAY REFER THE PROJECT TO HER INFLUENCE BUT HER INFLUENCE WAS SO QUIET THAT I KNOW NO MORE AND NOW INDEED I BEGAN TO THINK THAT IN MY OLD ASSOCIATION OF HER WITH THE STAINEDGLASS WINDOW IN THE CHURCH A PROPHETIC FORESHADOWING OF WHAT SHE WOULD BE TO ME IN THE CALAMITY THAT WAS TO HAPPEN IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME HAD FOUND A WAY INTO MY MIND IN ALL THAT SORROW FROM THE MOMENT NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN WHEN SHE STOOD BEFORE ME WITH HER UPRAISED HAND SHE WAS LIKE A SACRED PRESENCE IN MY LONELY HOUSE WHEN THE ANGEL OF DEATH ALIGHTED THERE MY CHILDWIFE FELL ASLEEPTHEY TOLD ME SO WHEN I COULD BEAR TO HEAR ITON HER BOSOM WITH A SMILE FROM MY SWOON I FIRST AWOKE TO A CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER COMPASSIONATE TEARS HER WORDS OF HOPE AND PEACE HER GENTLE FACE BENDING DOWN AS FROM A PURER REGION NEARER HEAVEN OVER MY UNDISCIPLINED HEART AND SOFTENING ITS PAIN LET ME GO ON I WAS TO GO ABROAD THAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DETERMINED AMONG US FROM THE FIRST THE GROUND NOW COVERING ALL THAT COULD PERISH OF MY DEPARTED WIFE I WAITED ONLY FOR WHAT

IS ON THE SEA THATS RIGHT SAID MY AUNT I AUGUR ALL SORT OF GOOD FROM YOUR SENSIBLE DECISION MADAM YOU DO US A GREAT DEAL OF HONOUR HE REJOINED HE THEN REFERRED TO A MEMORANDUM WITH RESPECT TO THE

STIPULATE ON STAMPS OF THE AMOUNTS RESPECTIVELY REQUIRED BY THE VARIOUS ACTS OF PARLIAMENT APPLYING TO SUCH SECURITIESAT EIGHTEEN TWENTYFOUR AND THIRTY MONTHS THE PROPOSITION I ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED WAS TWELVE EIGHTEEN AND TWENTYFOUR BUT I AM APPREHENSIVE THAT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT MIGHT NOT ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OFSOMETHINGTO TURN UP WE MIGHT NOT SAID MR MICAWBER LOOKING ROUND THE ROOM AS IF IT REPRESENTED SEVERAL HUNDRED ACRES OF HIGHLY CULTIVATED LAND ON THE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY BECOMING DUE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OUR HARVEST OR WE MIGHT NOT HAVE GOT OUR HARVEST IN LABOUR I BELIEVE IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN IN THAT PORTION OF OUR COLONIAL POSSESSIONS WHERE IT WILL BE OUR LOT TO COMBAT WITH THE TEEMING SOIL ARRANGE IT IN ANY WAY YOU PLEASE SIR SAID MY AUNT MADAM HE REPLIED MRS MICAWBER AND MYSELF ARE DEEPLY SENSIBLE OF THE VERY CONSIDERATE KINDNESS OF OUR FRIENDS AND PATRONS WHAT I WISH IS TO BE PERFECTLY BUSINESSLIKE AND PERFECTLY PUNCTUAL TURNING OVER AS WE ARE ABOUT TO TURN OVER AN ENTIRELY NEW LEAF AND FALLING BACK AS WE ARE NOW IN THE ACT OF FALLING BACK FOR A SPRING OF NO COMMON MAGNITUDE IT IS IMPORTANT TO MY SENSE OF SELFRESPECT BESIDES BEING AN EXAMPLE TO MY SON THAT THESE ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE CONCLUDED AS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN I DONT KNOW THAT MR MICAWBER ATTACHED ANY MEANING TO THIS LAST PHRASE I DONT KNOW THAT ANYBODY EVER DOES OR DID BUT HE APPEARED TO RELISH IT UNCOMMONLY AND REPEATED WITH AN IMPRESSIVE COUGH AS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN I PROPOSE SAID MR MICAWBER BILLSA CONVENIENCE TO THE MERCANTILE WORLD FOR WHICH I BELIEVE WE ARE ORIGINALLY INDEBTED TO THE JEWS WHO APPEAR TO ME TO HAVE HAD A DEVILISH DEAL TOO MUCH TO DO WITH THEM EVER SINCEBECAUSE THEY ARE NEGOTIABLE BUT IF A BOND OR ANY OTHER DESCRIPTION OF SECURITY WOULD BE PREFERRED I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO EXECUTE ANY SUCH INSTRUMENT AS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN MY AUNT OBSERVED THAT IN A CASE WHERE BOTH PARTIES WERE WILLING TO AGREE TO ANYTHING SHE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN SETTLING THIS POINT MR MICAWBER WAS OF HER OPINION IN REFERENCE TO OUR DOMESTIC PREPARATIONS MADAM SAID MR MICAWBER WITH SOME PRIDE FOR MEETING THE DESTINY TO WHICH WE ARE NOW UNDERSTOOD TO BE SELFDEVOTED I BEG TO REPORT THEM MY ELDEST DAUGHTER ATTENDS AT FIVE EVERY MORNING IN A NEIGHBOURING ESTABLISHMENT TO ACQUIRE THE PROCESSIF PROCESS IT MAY BE CALLEDOF MILKING COWS MY YOUNGER CHILDREN ARE INSTRUCTED TO OBSERVE AS CLOSELY AS CIRCUMSTANCES WILL PERMIT THE HABITS OF THE PIGS AND POULTRY MAINTAINED IN THE POORER PARTS OF THIS CITY A PURSUIT FROM WHICH THEY HAVE ON TWO OCCASIONS BEEN BROUGHT HOME WITHIN AN INCH OF BEING RUN OVER I HAVE MYSELF DIRECTED SOME ATTENTION DURING THE PAST WEEK TO THE ART OF BAKING AND MY SON WILKINS HAS ISSUED FORTH WITH A WALKINGSTICK AND DRIVEN CATTLE WHEN PERMITTED BY THE RUGGED HIRELINGS WHO HAD THEM IN CHARGE TO RENDER ANY VOLUNTARY SERVICE IN THAT DIRECTIONWHICH I REGRET TO SAY FOR THE CREDIT OF OUR NATURE WAS NOT OFTEN HE BEING GENERALLY WARNED WITH IMPRECATIONS TO DESIST ALL VERY RIGHT INDEED SAID MY AUNT ENCOURAGINGLY MRS MICAWBER HAS BEEN BUSY TOO I HAVE NO DOUBT MY DEAR MADAM RETURNED MRS MICAWBER WITH HER BUSINESSLIKE AIR I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PURSUITS IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED WITH CULTIVATION OR WITH STOCK THOUGH WELL AWARE THAT BOTH WILL CLAIM MY ATTENTION ON A FOREIGN SHORE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES AS I HAVE BEEN ENABLED TO ALIENATE FROM MY DOMESTIC DUTIES I HAVE DEVOTED TO CORRESPONDING AT SOME LENGTH WITH MY FAMILY FOR I OWN IT SEEMS TO ME MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD SAID MRS MICAWBER WHO ALWAYS FELL BACK ON ME I SUPPOSE FROM OLD HABIT TO WHOMSOEVER ELSE SHE MIGHT ADDRESS HER DISCOURSE AT STARTING THAT THE TIME IS COME WHEN THE PAST SHOULD BE BURIED IN OBLIVION WHEN MY FAMILY SHOULD TAKE MR MICAWBER BY THE HAND AND MR MICAWBER SHOULD TAKE MY FAMILY BY THE HAND WHEN THE LION SHOULD LIE DOWN WITH THE LAMB AND MY FAMILY BE ON TERMS WITH MR MICAWBER I SAID I THOUGHT SO TOO THIS AT LEAST IS THE LIGHT MY DEAR MR COPPERFIELD PURSUED MRS MICAWBER IN WHICH I VIEW THE SUBJECT WHEN I LIVED AT HOME WITH MY PAPA AND MAMA MY PAPA WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ASK WHEN ANY POINT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION IN OUR LIMITED CIRCLE IN WHAT LIGHT DOES MY EMMA VIEW THE SUBJECT THAT MY PAPA WAS TOO PARTIAL I KNOW STILL ON SUCH A POINT AS THE FRIGID COLDNESS WHICH HAS EVER SUBSISTED BETWEEN MR MICAWBER AND MY FAMILY I NECESSARILY HAVE FORMED AN OPINION DELUSIVE THOUGH IT MAY BE NO DOUBT OF COURSE YOU HAVE MAAM SAID MY AUNT PRECISELY SO ASSENTED MRS MICAWBER NOW I MAY BE WRONG IN MY CONCLUSIONS IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT I AM BUT MY INDIVIDUAL IMPRESSION IS THAT THE GULF BETWEEN MY FAMILY AND MR MICAWBER MAY BE TRACED TO AN APPREHENSION ON THE PART OF MY FAMILY THAT MR MICAWBER WOULD REQUIRE PECUNIARY ACCOMMODATION I CANNOT HELP THINKING SAID MRS MICAWBER WITH AN AIR OF DEEP SAGACITY THAT THERE ARE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY WHO HAVE BEEN APPREHENSIVE THAT MR MICAWBER WOULD SOLICIT THEM FOR THEIR NAMESI DO NOT MEAN TO BE CONFERRED IN BAPTISM UPON OUR CHILDREN BUT TO BE INSCRIBED ON BILLS OF EXCHANGE AND NEGOTIATED IN THE MONEY MARKET THE LOOK OF PENETRATION WITH WHICH MRS MICAWBER ANNOUNCED THIS DISCOVERY AS IF NO ONE HAD EVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE SEEMED RATHER TO ASTONISH MY AUNT WHO ABRUPTLY REPLIED WELL MAAM UPON THE WHOLE I SHOULDNT WONDER IF YOU WERE RIGHT MR MICAWBER BEING NOW ON THE EVE OF CASTING OFF THE PECUNIARY SHACKLES THAT HAVE SO LONG ENTHRALLED HIM SAID MRS MICAWBER AND OF COMMENCING A NEW CAREER IN A COUNTRY WHERE THERE IS SUFFICIENT RANGE FOR HIS ABILITIESWHICH IN MY OPINION IS EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT MR MICAWBERS ABILITIES PECULIARLY REQUIRING SPACEIT SEEMS TO ME THAT MY FAMILY SHOULD SIGNALIZE THE OCCASION BY COMING FORWARD WHAT I COULD WISH TO SEE WOULD BE A MEETING BETWEEN MR MICAWBER AND MY FAMILY AT A FESTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE GIVEN AT MY FAMILYS EXPENSE WHERE MR MICAWBERS HEALTH AND PROSPERITY BEING PROPOSED BY SOME LEADING MEMBER OF MY FAMILY MR MICAWBER MIGHT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF DEVELOPING HIS VIEWS MY DEAR SAID MR MICAWBER WITH SOME HEAT IT MAY BE BETTER FOR ME TO STATE DISTINCTLY AT ONCE THAT IF I WERE TO DEVELOP MY VIEWS TO THAT ASSEMBLED GROUP THEY WOULD POSSIBLY BE FOUND OF AN OFFENSIVE NATURE MY IMPRESSION BEING THAT YOUR FAMILY ARE IN THE AGGREGATE IMPERTINENT SNOBS AND IN DETAIL UNMITIGATED RUFFIANS MICAWBER SAID MRS MICAWBER SHAKING HER HEAD NO YOU HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THEM AND THEY HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD YOU MR MICAWBER COUGHED THEY HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD YOU MICAWBER SAID HIS WIFE THEY MAY BE INCAPABLE OF IT IF SO THAT IS THEIR MISFORTUNE I CAN PITY THEIR MISFORTUNE I AM EXTREMELY SORRY MY DEAR EMMA SAID MR MICAWBER RELENTING TO HAVE BEEN BETRAYED INTO ANY EXPRESSIONS THAT MIGHT EVEN REMOTELY HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF BEING STRONG EXPRESSIONS ALL I WOULD SAY IS THAT I CAN GO ABROAD WITHOUT YOUR FAMILY COMING FORWARD TO FAVOUR MEIN SHORT WITH A PARTING SHOVE OF THEIR COLD SHOULDERS AND THAT UPON THE WHOLE I WOULD RATHER LEAVE ENGLAND WITH SUCH IMPETUS AS I POSSESS THAN DERIVE ANY ACCELERATION OF IT FROM THAT QUARTER AT THE SAME TIME MY DEAR IF THEY SHOULD CONDESCEND TO REPLY TO YOUR COMMUNICATIONSWHICH OUR JOINT EXPERIENCE RENDERS MOST IMPROBABLEFAR BE IT FROM ME TO BE A BARRIER TO YOUR WISHES THE MATTER BEING THUS AMICABLY SETTLED MR MICAWBER GAVE MRS MICAWBER HIS ARM AND GLANCING AT THE HEAP OF BOOKS AND PAPERS LYING BEFORE TRADDLES ON THE TABLE SAID THEY WOULD LEAVE US TO OURSELVES WHICH THEY CEREMONIOUSLY DID MY DEAR COPPERFIELD SAID TRADDLES LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR WHEN THEY WERE GONE AND LOOKING AT ME WITH AN AFFECTION THAT MADE HIS EYES RED AND HIS HAIR ALL KINDS OF SHAPES I DONT MAKE ANY EXCUSE FOR TROUBLING YOU WITH BUSINESS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU ARE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN IT AND IT MAY DIVERT YOUR THOUGHTS MY DEAR BOY I HOPE YOU ARE NOT WORN OUT I AM QUITE MYSELF SAID I AFTER A PAUSE WE HAVE MORE CAUSE TO THINK OF MY AUNT THAN OF ANYONE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH SHE HAS DONE SURELY SURELY ANSWERED TRADDLES WHO CAN FORGET IT BUT EVEN THAT IS NOT ALL SAID I DURING THE LAST FORTNIGHT SOME NEW TROUBLE HAS VEXED HER AND SHE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF LONDON EVERY DAY SEVERAL TIMES SHE HAS GONE OUT EARLY AND BEEN ABSENT UNTIL EVENING LAST NIGHT TRADDLES WITH THIS JOURNEY BEFORE HER IT WAS ALMOST MIDNIGHT BEFORE SHE CAME HOME YOU KNOW WHAT HER CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS IS SHE WILL NOT TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO DISTRESS HER MY AUNT VERY PALE AND WITH DEEP LINES IN HER FACE SAT IMMOVABLE UNTIL I HAD FINISHED WHEN SOME STRAY TEARS FOUND THEIR WAY TO HER CHEEKS AND SHE PUT HER HAND ON MINE ITS NOTHING TROT ITS NOTHING THERE WILL BE NO MORE OF IT YOU SHALL KNOW BY AND BY NOW AGNES MY DEAR LET US ATTEND TO THESE AFFAIRS I MUST DO MR MICAWBER THE JUSTICE TO SAY TRADDLES BEGAN THAT ALTHOUGH HE WOULD APPEAR NOT TO HAVE WORKED TO ANY GOOD ACCOUNT FOR HIMSELF HE IS A MOST UNTIRING MAN WHEN HE WORKS FOR OTHER PEOPLE I NEVER SAW SUCH A FELLOW IF HE ALWAYS GOES ON IN THE SAME WAY HE MUST BE VIRTUALLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD AT PRESENT THE HEAT INTO WHICH HE HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY PUTTING HIMSELF AND THE DISTRACTED AND IMPETUOUS MANNER IN WHICH HE HAS BEEN DIVING DAY AND NIGHT AMONG PAPERS AND BOOKS TO SAY NOTHING OF THE IMMENSE NUMBER OF LETTERS HE HAS WRITTEN ME BETWEEN THIS HOUSE AND MR WICKFIELDS AND OFTEN ACROSS THE TABLE WHEN HE HAS BEEN SITTING OPPOSITE AND MIGHT MUCH MORE EASILY HAVE SPOKEN IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY LETTERS CRIED MY AUNT I BELIEVE HE DREAMS IN LETTERS THERES MR DICK TOO SAID TRADDLES HAS BEEN DOING WONDERS AS SOON AS HE WAS RELEASED FROM OVERLOOKING URIAH HEEP WHOM HE KEPT IN SUCH CHARGE AS I NEVER SAW EXCEEDED HE BEGAN TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO MR WICKFIELD AND REALLY HIS ANXIETY TO BE OF USE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS WE HAVE BEEN MAKING AND HIS REAL USEFULNESS IN EXTRACTING AND COPYING AND FETCHING AND CARRYING HAVE BEEN QUITE STIMULATING TO US DICK IS A VERY REMARKABLE MAN EXCLAIMED MY AUNT AND I ALWAYS SAID HE WAS TROT YOU KNOW IT I AM HAPPY TO SAY MISS WICKFIELD PURSUED TRADDLES AT ONCE WITH GREAT DELICACY AND WITH GREAT EARNESTNESS THAT IN YOUR ABSENCE MR WICKFIELD HAS CONSIDERABLY IMPROVED RELIEVED OF THE INCUBUS THAT HAD FASTENED UPON HIM FOR SO LONG A TIME AND OF THE DREADFUL APPREHENSIONS UNDER WHICH HE HAD LIVED HE IS HARDLY THE SAME PERSON AT TIMES EVEN HIS IMPAIRED POWER OF CONCENTRATING HIS MEMORY AND ATTENTION ON PARTICULAR POINTS OF BUSINESS HAS RECOVERED ITSELF VERY MUCH AND HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ASSIST US IN MAKING SOME THINGS CLEAR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE FOUND VERY DIFFICULT INDEED IF NOT HOPELESS WITHOUT HIM BUT WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS TO COME TO RESULTS WHICH ARE SHORT ENOUGH NOT TO GOSSIP ON ALL THE HOPEFUL CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE OBSERVED OR I SHALL NEVER HAVE DONE HIS NATURAL MANNER AND AGREEABLE SIMPLICITY MADE IT TRANSPARENT THAT HE SAID THIS TO PUT US IN GOOD HEART AND TO ENABLE AGNES TO HEAR HER FATHER MENTIONED WITH GREATER CONFIDENCE BUT IT WAS NOT THE LESS PLEASANT FOR THAT NOW LET ME SEE SAID TRADDLES LOOKING AMONG THE PAPERS ON THE TABLE HAVING COUNTED OUR FUNDS AND REDUCED TO ORDER A GREAT MASS OF UNINTENTIONAL CONFUSION IN THE FIRST PLACE AND OF WILFUL CONFUSION AND FALSIFICATION IN THE SECOND WE TAKE IT TO BE CLEAR THAT MR WICKFIELD MIGHT NOW WIND UP HIS BUSINESS AND HIS AGENCYTRUST AND EXHIBIT NO DEFICIENCY OR DEFALCATION WHATEVER OH THANK HEAVEN CRIED AGNES FERVENTLY BUT SAID TRADDLES THE SURPLUS THAT WOULD BE LEFT AS HIS MEANS OF SUPPORTAND I SUPPOSE THE HOUSE TO BE SOLD EVEN IN SAYING THISWOULD BE SO SMALL NOT EXCEEDING IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME HUNDREDS OF POUNDS THAT PERHAPS MISS WICKFIELD IT WOULD BE BEST TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT RETAIN HIS AGENCY OF THE ESTATE TO WHICH HE HAS SO LONG BEEN RECEIVER HIS FRIENDS MIGHT ADVISE HIM YOU KNOW NOW HE IS FREE YOU YOURSELF MISS WICKFIELDCOPPERFIELDI I HAVE CONSIDERED IT TROTWOOD SAID AGNES LOOKING TO ME AND I FEEL THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE AND MUST NOT BE EVEN ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF A FRIEND TO WHOM I AM SO GRATEFUL AND OWE SO MUCH I WILL NOT SAY THAT I RECOMMEND IT OBSERVED TRADDLES I THINK IT RIGHT TO SUGGEST IT NO MORE I AM HAPPY TO HEAR YOU SAY SO ANSWERED AGNES STEADILY FOR IT GIVES ME HOPE ALMOST ASSURANCE THAT WE THINK ALIKE DEAR MR TRADDLES AND DEAR TROTWOOD PAPA ONCE FREE WITH HONOUR WHAT COULD I WISH FOR I HAVE ALWAYS ASPIRED IF I COULD HAVE RELEASED HIM FROM THE TOILS IN WHICH HE WAS HELD TO RENDER BACK SOME LITTLE PORTION OF THE LOVE AND CARE I OWE HIM AND TO DEVOTE MY LIFE TO HIM IT HAS BEEN FOR YEARS THE UTMOST HEIGHT OF MY HOPES TO TAKE OUR FUTURE ON MYSELF WILL BE THE NEXT GREAT HAPPINESSTHE NEXT TO HIS RELEASE FROM ALL TRUST AND RESPONSIBILITYTHAT I CAN KNOW HAVE YOU THOUGHT HOW AGNES OFTEN I AM NOT AFRAID DEAR TROTWOOD I AM CERTAIN OF SUCCESS SO MANY PEOPLE KNOW ME HERE AND THINK KINDLY OF ME THAT I AM CERTAIN DONT MISTRUST ME OUR WANTS ARE NOT MANY IF I RENT THE DEAR OLD HOUSE AND KEEP A SCHOOL I SHALL BE USEFUL AND HAPPY THE CALM FERVOUR OF HER CHEERFUL VOICE BROUGHT BACK SO VIVIDLY FIRST THE DEAR OLD HOUSE ITSELF AND THEN MY SOLITARY HOME THAT MY HEART WAS TOO FULL FOR SPEECH TRADDLES PRETENDED FOR A LITTLE WHILE TO BE BUSILY LOOKING AMONG THE PAPERS NEXT MISS TROTWOOD SAID TRADDLES THAT PROPERTY OF YOURS WELL SIR SIGHED MY AUNT ALL I HAVE GOT TO SAY ABOUT IT IS THAT IF ITS GONE I CAN BEAR IT AND IF ITS NOT GONE I SHALL BE GLAD TO GET IT BACK IT WAS ORIGINALLY I THINK EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS CONSOLS SAID TRADDLES RIGHT REPLIED MY AUNT I CANT ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN FIVE SAID TRADDLES WITH AN AIR OF PERPLEXITY THOUSAND DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED MY AUNT WITH UNCOMMON COMPOSURE OR POUNDS FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS SAID TRADDLES IT WAS ALL THERE WAS RETURNED MY AUNT I SOLD THREE MYSELF ONE I PAID FOR YOUR ARTICLES TROT MY DEAR AND THE OTHER TWO I HAVE BY ME WHEN I LOST THE REST I THOUGHT IT WISE TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT THAT SUM BUT TO KEEP IT SECRETLY FOR A RAINY DAY I WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU WOULD COME OUT OF THE TRIAL TROT AND YOU CAME OUT NOBLYPERSEVERING SELFRELIANT SELFDENYING SO DID DICK DONT SPEAK TO ME FOR I FIND MY NERVES A LITTLE SHAKEN NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO TO SEE HER SITTING UPRIGHT WITH HER ARMS FOLDED BUT SHE HAD WONDERFUL SELFCOMMAND THEN I AM DELIGHTED TO SAY CRIED TRADDLES BEAMING WITH JOY THAT WE HAVE RECOVERED THE WHOLE MONEY DONT CONGRATULATE ME ANYBODY EXCLAIMED MY AUNT HOW SO SIR YOU BELIEVED IT HAD BEEN MISAPPROPRIATED BY MR WICKFIELD SAID TRADDLES OF COURSE I DID SAID MY AUNT AND WAS THEREFORE EASILY SILENCED AGNES NOT A WORD AND INDEED SAID TRADDLES IT WAS SOLD BY VIRTUE OF THE POWER OF MANAGEMENT HE HELD FROM YOU BUT I NEEDNT SAY BY WHOM SOLD OR ON WHOSE ACTUAL SIGNATURE IT WAS AFTERWARDS PRETENDED TO MR WICKFIELD BY THAT RASCALAND PROVED TOO BY FIGURESTHAT HE HAD POSSESSED HIMSELF OF THE MONEY ON GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS HE SAID TO KEEP OTHER DEFICIENCIES AND DIFFICULTIES FROM THE LIGHT MR WICKFIELD BEING SO WEAK AND HELPLESS IN HIS HANDS AS TO PAY YOU AFTERWARDS SEVERAL SUMS OF INTEREST ON A PRETENDED PRINCIPAL WHICH HE KNEW DID NOT EXIST MADE HIMSELF UNHAPPILY A PARTY TO THE FRAUD AND AT LAST TOOK THE BLAME UPON HIMSELF ADDED MY AUNT AND WROTE ME A MAD LETTER CHARGING HIMSELF WITH ROBBERY AND WRONG UNHEARD OF UPON WHICH I PAID HIM A VISIT EARLY ONE MORNING CALLED FOR A CANDLE BURNT THE LETTER AND TOLD HIM IF HE EVER COULD RIGHT ME AND HIMSELF TO DO IT AND IF HE COULDNT TO KEEP HIS OWN COUNSEL FOR HIS DAUGHTERS SAKEIF ANYBODY SPEAKS TO ME ILL LEAVE THE HOUSE WE ALL REMAINED QUIET AGNES COVERING HER FACE WELL MY DEAR FRIEND SAID MY AUNT AFTER A PAUSE AND YOU HAVE REALLY EXTORTED THE MONEY BACK FROM HIM WHY THE FACT IS RETURNED TRADDLES MR MICAWBER HAD SO COMPLETELY HEMMED HIM IN AND WAS ALWAYS READY WITH SO MANY NEW POINTS IF AN OLD ONE FAILED THAT HE COULD NOT ESCAPE FROM US A MOST REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IS THAT I REALLY DONT THINK HE GRASPED THIS SUM EVEN SO MUCH FOR THE GRATIFICATION OF HIS AVARICE WHICH WAS INORDINATE AS IN THE HATRED HE FELT FOR COPPERFIELD HE SAID SO TO ME PLAINLY HE SAID HE WOULD EVEN HAVE SPENT AS MUCH TO BAULK OR INJURE COPPERFIELD HA SAID MY AUNT KNITTING HER BROWS THOUGHTFULLY AND GLANCING AT AGNES AND WHATS BECOME OF HIM I DONT KNOW HE LEFT HERE SAID TRADDLES WITH HIS MOTHER WHO HAD BEEN CLAMOURING AND BESEECHING AND DISCLOSING THE WHOLE TIME THEY WENT AWAY BY ONE OF THE LONDON NIGHT COACHES AND I KNOW NO MORE ABOUT HIM EXCEPT THAT HIS MALEVOLENCE TO ME AT PARTING WAS AUDACIOUS HE SEEMED TO CONSIDER HIMSELF HARDLY LESS INDEBTED TO ME THAN TO MR MICAWBER WHICH I CONSIDER AS I TOLD HIM QUITE A COMPLIMENT DO YOU SUPPOSE HE HAS ANY MONEY TRADDLES I ASKED OH DEAR YES I SHOULD THINK SO HE REPLIED SHAKING HIS HEAD SERIOUSLY I SHOULD SAY HE MUST HAVE POCKETED A GOOD DEAL IN ONE WAY OR OTHER BUT I THINK YOU WOULD FIND COPPERFIELD IF YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING HIS COURSE THAT MONEY WOULD NEVER KEEP THAT MAN OUT OF MISCHIEF HE IS SUCH AN INCARNATE HYPOCRITE THAT WHATEVER OBJECT HE PURSUES HE MUST PURSUE CROOKEDLY ITS HIS ONLY COMPENSATION FOR THE OUTWARD RESTRAINTS HE PUTS UPON HIMSELF ALWAYS CREEPING ALONG THE GROUND TO SOME SMALL END OR OTHER HE WILL ALWAYS MAGNIFY EVERY OBJECT IN THE WAY AND CONSEQUENTLY WILL HATE AND SUSPECT EVERYBODY THAT COMES IN THE MOST INNOCENT MANNER BETWEEN HIM AND IT SO THE CROOKED COURSES WILL BECOME CROOKEDER AT ANY MOMENT FOR THE LEAST REASON OR FOR NONE ITS ONLY NECESSARY TO CONSIDER HIS HISTORY HERE SAID TRADDLES TO KNOW THAT HES A MONSTER OF MEANNESS SAID MY AUNT REALLY I DONT KNOW ABOUT THAT OBSERVED TRADDLES THOUGHTFULLY MANY PEOPLE CAN BE VERY MEAN WHEN THEY GIVE THEIR MINDS TO IT AND NOW TOUCHING MR MICAWBER SAID MY AUNT WELL REALLY SAID TRADDLES CHEERFULLY I MUST ONCE MORE GIVE MR MICAWBER HIGH PRAISE BUT FOR HIS HAVING BEEN SO PATIENT AND PERSEVERING FOR SO LONG A TIME WE NEVER COULD HAVE HOPED TO DO ANYTHING WORTH SPEAKING OF AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER THAT MR MICAWBER DID RIGHT FOR RIGHTS SAKE WHEN WE REFLECT WHAT TERMS HE MIGHT HAVE MADE WITH URIAH HEEP HIMSELF FOR HIS SILENCE I THINK SO TOO SAID I NOW WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE HIM INQUIRED MY AUNT OH BEFORE YOU COME TO THAT SAID TRADDLES A LITTLE DISCONCERTED I AM AFRAID I THOUGHT IT DISCREET TO OMIT NOT BEING ABLE TO CARRY EVERYTHING BEFORE ME TWO POINTS IN MAKING THIS LAWLESS ADJUSTMENTFOR ITS PERFECTLY LAWLESS FROM BEGINNING TO ENDOF A DIFFICULT AFFAIR THOSE IOUS AND SO FORTH WHICH MR MICAWBER GAVE HIM FOR THE ADVANCES HE HAD WELL THEY MUST BE PAID SAID MY AUNT YES BUT I DONT KNOW WHEN THEY MAY BE PROCEEDED ON OR WHERE THEY ARE REJOINED TRADDLES OPENING HIS EYES AND I ANTICIPATE THAT BETWEEN THIS TIME AND HIS DEPARTURE MR MICAWBER WILL BE CONSTANTLY ARRESTED OR TAKEN IN EXECUTION THEN HE MUST BE CONSTANTLY SET FREE AGAIN AND TAKEN OUT OF EXECUTION SAID MY AUNT WHATS THE AMOUNT ALTOGETHER WHY MR MICAWBER HAS ENTERED THE TRANSACTIONSHE CALLS THEM TRANSACTIONSWITH GREAT FORM IN A BOOK REJOINED TRADDLES SMILING AND HE MAKES THE AMOUNT A HUNDRED AND THREE POUNDS FIVE NOW WHAT SHALL WE GIVE HIM THAT SUM INCLUDED SAID MY AUNT AGNES MY DEAR YOU AND I CAN TALK ABOUT DIVISION OF IT AFTERWARDS WHAT SHOULD IT BE FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS UPON THIS TRADDLES AND I BOTH STRUCK IN AT ONCE WE BOTH RECOMMENDED A SMALL SUM IN MONEY AND THE PAYMENT WITHOUT STIPULATION TO MR MICAWBER OF THE URIAH CLAIMS AS THEY CAME IN WE PROPOSED THAT THE FAMILY SHOULD HAVE THEIR PASSAGE AND THEIR OUTFIT AND A HUNDRED POUNDS AND THAT MR MICAWBERS ARRANGEMENT FOR THE REPAYMENT OF THE ADVANCES SHOULD BE GRAVELY ENTERED INTO AS IT MIGHT BE WHOLESOME FOR HIM TO SUPPOSE HIMSELF UNDER THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS I ADDED THE SUGGESTION THAT I SHOULD GIVE SOME EXPLANATION OF HIS CHARACTER AND HISTORY TO MR PEGGOTTY WHO I KNEW COULD BE RELIED ON AND THAT TO MR PEGGOTTY SHOULD BE QUIETLY ENTRUSTED THE DISCRETION OF ADVANCING ANOTHER HUNDRED I FURTHER PROPOSED TO INTEREST MR MICAWBER IN MR PEGGOTTY BY CONFIDING SO MUCH OF MR PEGGOTTYS STORY TO HIM AS I MIGHT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN RELATING OR MIGHT THINK EXPEDIENT AND TO ENDEAVOUR TO BRING EACH OF THEM TO BEAR UPON THE OTHER FOR THE COMMON ADVANTAGE WE ALL ENTERED WARMLY INTO THESE VIEWS AND I MAY MENTION AT ONCE THAT THE PRINCIPALS THEMSELVES DID SO SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WITH PERFECT GOOD WILL AND HARMONY SEEING THAT TRADDLES NOW GLANCED ANXIOUSLY AT MY AUNT AGAIN I REMINDED HIM OF THE SECOND AND LAST POINT TO WHICH HE HAD ADVERTED YOU AND YOUR AUNT WILL EXCUSE ME COPPERFIELD IF I TOUCH UPON A PAINFUL THEME AS I GREATLY FEAR I SHALL SAID TRADDLES HESITATING BUT I THINK IT NECESSARY TO BRING IT TO YOUR RECOLLECTION ON THE DAY OF MR MICAWBERS MEMORABLE DENUNCIATION A THREATENING ALLUSION WAS MADE BY URIAH HEEP TO YOUR AUNTSHUSBAND MY AUNT RETAINING HER STIFF POSITION AND APPARENT COMPOSURE ASSENTED WITH A NOD PERHAPS OBSERVED TRADDLES IT WAS MERE PURPOSELESS IMPERTINENCE NO RETURNED MY AUNT THERE WASPARDON MEREALLY SUCH A PERSON AND AT ALL IN HIS POWER HINTED TRADDLES YES MY GOOD FRIEND SAID MY AUNT TRADDLES WITH A PERCEPTIBLE LENGTHENING OF HIS FACE EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO APPROACH THIS SUBJECT THAT IT HAD SHARED THE FATE OF MR MICAWBERS LIABILITIES IN NOT BEING COMPREHENDED IN THE TERMS HE HAD MADE THAT WE WERE NO LONGER OF ANY AUTHORITY WITH URIAH HEEP AND THAT IF HE COULD DO US OR ANY OF US ANY INJURY OR ANNOYANCE NO DOUBT HE WOULD MY AUNT REMAINED QUIET UNTIL AGAIN SOME STRAY TEARS FOUND THEIR WAY TO HER CHEEKS YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SHE SAID IT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL TO MENTION IT CAN IOR COPPERFIELDDO ANYTHING ASKED TRADDLES GENTLY NOTHING SAID MY AUNT I THANK YOU MANY TIMES TROT MY DEAR A VAIN THREAT LET US HAVE MR AND MRS MICAWBER BACK AND DONT ANY OF YOU SPEAK TO ME WITH THAT SHE SMOOTHED HER DRESS AND SAT WITH HER UPRIGHT CARRIAGE LOOKING AT THE DOOR WELL MR AND MRS MICAWBER SAID MY AUNT WHEN THEY ENTERED WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING YOUR EMIGRATION WITH MANY APOLOGIES TO YOU FOR KEEPING YOU OUT OF THE ROOM SO LONG AND ILL TELL YOU WHAT ARRANGEMENTS WE PROPOSE THESE SHE EXPLAINED TO THE UNBOUNDED SATISFACTION OF THE FAMILYCHILDREN AND ALL BEING THEN PRESENTAND SO MUCH TO THE AWAKENING OF MR MICAWBERS PUNCTUAL HABITS IN THE OPENING STAGE OF ALL BILL TRANSACTIONS THAT HE COULD NOT BE DISSUADED FROM IMMEDIATELY RUSHING OUT IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS TO BUY THE STAMPS FOR HIS NOTES OF HAND BUT HIS JOY RECEIVED A SUDDEN CHECK FOR WITHIN FIVE MINUTES HE RETURNED IN THE CUSTODY OF A SHERIFF S OFFICER INFORMING US IN A FLOOD OF TEARS THAT ALL WAS LOST WE BEING QUITE PREPARED FOR THIS EVENT WHICH WAS OF COURSE A PROCEEDING OF URIAH HEEPS SOON PAID THE MONEY AND IN FIVE MINUTES MORE MR MICAWBER WAS SEATED AT THE TABLE FILLING UP THE STAMPS WITH AN EXPRESSION OF PERFECT JOY WHICH ONLY THAT CONGENIAL EMPLOYMENT OR THE MAKING OF PUNCH COULD IMPART IN FULL COMPLETENESS TO HIS SHINING FACE TO SEE HIM AT WORK ON THE STAMPS WITH THE RELISH OF AN ARTIST TOUCHING THEM LIKE PICTURES LOOKING AT THEM SIDEWAYS TAKING WEIGHTY NOTES OF DATES AND AMOUNTS IN HIS POCKETBOOK AND CONTEMPLATING THEM WHEN FINISHED WITH A HIGH SENSE OF THEIR PRECIOUS VALUE WAS A SIGHT INDEED NOW THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO SIR IF YOULL ALLOW ME TO ADVISE YOU SAID MY AUNT AFTER SILENTLY OBSERVING HIM IS TO ABJURE THAT OCCUPATION FOR EVERMORE MADAM REPLIED MR MICAWBER IT IS MY INTENTION TO REGISTER SUCH A VOW ON THE VIRGIN PAGE OF THE FUTURE MRS MICAWBER WILL ATTEST IT I TRUST SAID MR MICAWBER SOLEMNLY THAT MY SON WILKINS WILL EVER BEAR IN MIND THAT HE HAD INFINITELY BETTER PUT HIS FIST IN THE FIRE THAN USE IT TO HANDLE THE SERPENTS THAT HAVE POISONED THE LIFEBLOOD OF HIS UNHAPPY PARENT DEEPLY AFFECTED AND CHANGED IN A MOMENT TO THE IMAGE OF DESPAIR MR MICAWBER REGARDED THE SERPENTS WITH A LOOK OF GLOOMY ABHORRENCE IN WHICH HIS LATE ADMIRATION OF THEM WAS NOT QUITE SUBDUED FOLDED THEM UP AND PUT THEM IN HIS POCKET THIS CLOSED THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE EVENING WE WERE WEARY WITH SORROW AND FATIGUE AND MY AUNT AND I WERE TO RETURN TO LONDON ON THE MORROW IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THE MICAWBERS SHOULD FOLLOW US AFTER EFFECTING A SALE OF THEIR GOODS TO A BROKER THAT MR WICKFIELDS AFFAIRS SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO A SETTLEMENT WITH ALL CONVENIENT SPEED UNDER THE DIRECTION OF TRADDLES AND THAT AGNES SHOULD ALSO COME TO LONDON PENDING THOSE ARRANGEMENTS WE PASSED THE NIGHT AT THE OLD HOUSE WHICH FREED FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE HEEPS SEEMED PURGED OF A DISEASE AND I LAY IN MY OLD ROOM LIKE A SHIPWRECKED WANDERER COME HOME WE WENT BACK NEXT DAY TO MY AUNTS HOUSENOT TO MINEAND WHEN SHE AND I SAT ALONE AS OF OLD BEFORE GOING TO BED SHE SAID TROT DO YOU

AND IS LOOKING EXTREMELY WELL HAS PAID THE DEBT AND COSTS IN THE NOBLE NAME OF MISS TROTWOOD AND THAT MYSELF AND FAMILY ARE AT THE HEIGHT OF EARTHLY BLISS CHAPTER TEMPEST I NOW APPROACH AN EVENT IN MY LIFE SO INDELIBLE SO AWFUL SO BOUND BY AN INFINITE VARIETY OF TIES TO ALL THAT HAS PRECEDED IT IN THESE PAGES THAT FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY NARRATIVE I HAVE SEEN IT GROWING LARGER AND LARGER AS I ADVANCED LIKE A GREAT TOWER IN A PLAIN AND THROWING ITS FORECAST SHADOW EVEN ON THE INCIDENTS OF MY CHILDISH DAYS FOR YEARS AFTER IT OCCURRED I DREAMED OF IT OFTEN I HAVE STARTED UP SO VIVIDLY IMPRESSED BY IT THAT ITS FURY HAS YET SEEMED RAGING IN MY QUIET ROOM IN THE STILL NIGHT I DREAM OF IT SOMETIMES THOUGH AT LENGTHENED AND UNCERTAIN INTERVALS TO THIS HOUR I HAVE AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN IT AND A STORMY WIND OR THE LIGHTEST MENTION OF A SEASHORE AS STRONG AS ANY OF WHICH MY MIND IS CONSCIOUS AS PLAINLY AS I BEHOLD WHAT HAPPENED I WILL TRY TO WRITE IT DOWN I DO NOT RECALL IT BUT SEE IT DONE FOR IT HAPPENS AGAIN BEFORE ME THE TIME DRAWING ON RAPIDLY FOR THE SAILING OF THE EMIGRANTSHIP MY GOOD OLD NURSE ALMOST BROKENHEARTED FOR ME WHEN WE FIRST MET CAME UP TO LONDON I WAS CONSTANTLY WITH HER AND HER BROTHER AND THE MICAWBERS THEY BEING VERY MUCH TOGETHER BUT EMILY I NEVER SAW ONE EVENING WHEN THE TIME WAS CLOSE AT HAND I WAS ALONE WITH PEGGOTTY AND HER BROTHER OUR CONVERSATION TURNED ON HAM SHE DESCRIBED TO US HOW TENDERLY HE HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF HER AND HOW MANFULLY AND QUIETLY HE HAD BORNE HIMSELF MOST OF ALL OF LATE WHEN SHE BELIEVED HE WAS MOST TRIED IT WAS A SUBJECT OF WHICH THE AFFECTIONATE CREATURE NEVER TIRED AND OUR INTEREST IN HEARING THE MANY EXAMPLES WHICH SHE WHO WAS SO MUCH WITH HIM HAD TO RELATE WAS EQUAL TO HERS IN RELATING THEM MY AUNT AND I WERE AT THAT

NOTHING TO ME I AM RESTLESS AND SHALL BE BETTER IN MOTION ILL GO DOWN TONIGHT THOUGH HE ANXIOUSLY ENDEAVOURED TO DISSUADE ME I SAW THAT HE WAS OF MY MIND AND THIS IF I HAD REQUIRED TO BE CONFIRMED IN MY INTENTION WOULD HAVE HAD THE EFFECT HE WENT ROUND TO THE COACH OFFICE AT MY REQUEST AND TOOK THE BOXSEAT FOR ME ON THE MAIL IN THE EVENING I STARTED BY THAT CONVEYANCE DOWN THE ROAD I HAD TRAVERSED UNDER SO MANY VICISSITUDES DONT YOU THINK THAT I ASKED THE COACHMAN IN THE FIRST STAGE OUT OF LONDON A VERY REMARKABLE SKY I DONT REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN ONE LIKE IT NOR INOT EQUAL TO IT HE REPLIED THATS WIND SIR THERELL BE MISCHIEF DONE AT SEA I EXPECT BEFORE LONG IT WAS A MURKY CONFUSIONHERE AND THERE BLOTTED WITH A COLOUR LIKE THE COLOUR OF THE SMOKE FROM DAMP FUELOF FLYING CLOUDS TOSSED UP INTO MOST REMARKABLE HEAPS SUGGESTING GREATER HEIGHTS IN THE CLOUDS THAN THERE WERE DEPTHS BELOW THEM TO THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEPEST HOLLOWS IN THE EARTH THROUGH WHICH THE WILD MOON SEEMED TO PLUNGE HEADLONG AS IF IN A DREAD DISTURBANCE OF THE LAWS OF NATURE SHE HAD LOST HER WAY AND WERE FRIGHTENED THERE HAD BEEN A WIND ALL DAY AND IT WAS RISING THEN WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY GREAT SOUND IN ANOTHER HOUR IT HAD MUCH INCREASED AND THE SKY WAS MORE OVERCAST AND BLEW HARD BUT AS THE NIGHT ADVANCED THE CLOUDS CLOSING IN AND DENSELY OVERSPREADING THE WHOLE SKY THEN VERY DARK IT CAME ON TO BLOW HARDER AND HARDER IT STILL INCREASED UNTIL OUR HORSES COULD SCARCELY FACE THE WIND MANY TIMES IN THE DARK PART OF THE NIGHT IT WAS THEN LATE IN SEPTEMBER WHEN THE NIGHTS WERE NOT SHORT THE LEADERS TURNED ABOUT OR CAME TO A DEAD STOP AND WE WERE OFTEN IN SERIOUS APPREHENSION THAT THE COACH WOULD BE BLOWN OVER SWEEPING GUSTS OF RAIN CAME UP BEFORE THIS STORM LIKE SHOWERS OF STEEL AND AT THOSE TIMES WHEN THERE WAS ANY SHELTER OF TREES OR LEE WALLS TO BE GOT WE WERE FAIN TO STOP IN A SHEER IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONTINUING THE STRUGGLE WHEN THE DAY BROKE IT BLEW HARDER AND HARDER I HAD BEEN IN YARMOUTH WHEN THE SEAMEN SAID IT BLEW GREAT GUNS BUT I HAD NEVER KNOWN THE LIKE OF THIS OR ANYTHING APPROACHING TO IT WE CAME TO IPSWICHVERY LATE HAVING HAD TO FIGHT EVERY INCH OF GROUND SINCE WE WERE TEN MILES OUT OF LONDON AND FOUND A CLUSTER OF PEOPLE IN THE MARKETPLACE WHO HAD RISEN FROM THEIR BEDS IN THE NIGHT FEARFUL OF FALLING CHIMNEYS SOME OF THESE CONGREGATING ABOUT THE INNYARD WHILE WE CHANGED HORSES TOLD US OF GREAT SHEETS OF LEAD HAVING BEEN RIPPED OFF A HIGH CHURCHTOWER AND FLUNG INTO A BYSTREET WHICH THEY THEN BLOCKED UP OTHERS HAD TO TELL OF COUNTRY PEOPLE COMING IN FROM NEIGHBOURING VILLAGES WHO HAD SEEN GREAT TREES LYING TORN OUT OF THE EARTH AND WHOLE RICKS SCATTERED ABOUT THE ROADS AND FIELDS STILL THERE WAS NO ABATEMENT IN THE STORM BUT IT BLEW HARDER AS WE STRUGGLED ON NEARER AND NEARER TO THE SEA FROM WHICH THIS MIGHTY WIND WAS BLOWING DEAD ON SHORE ITS FORCE BECAME MORE AND MORE TERRIFIC LONG BEFORE WE SAW THE SEA ITS SPRAY WAS ON OUR LIPS AND SHOWERED SALT RAIN UPON US THE WATER WAS OUT OVER MILES AND MILES OF THE FLAT COUNTRY ADJACENT TO YARMOUTH AND EVERY SHEET AND PUDDLE LASHED ITS BANKS AND HAD ITS STRESS OF LITTLE BREAKERS SETTING HEAVILY TOWARDS US WHEN WE CAME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SEA THE WAVES ON THE HORIZON CAUGHT AT INTERVALS ABOVE THE ROLLING ABYSS WERE LIKE GLIMPSES OF ANOTHER SHORE WITH TOWERS AND BUILDINGS WHEN AT LAST WE GOT INTO THE TOWN THE PEOPLE CAME OUT TO THEIR DOORS ALL ASLANT AND WITH STREAMING HAIR MAKING A WONDER OF THE MAIL THAT HAD COME THROUGH SUCH A NIGHT I PUT UP AT THE OLD INN AND WENT DOWN TO LOOK AT THE SEA STAGGERING ALONG THE STREET WHICH WAS STREWN WITH SAND AND SEAWEED AND WITH FLYING BLOTCHES OF SEAFOAM AFRAID OF FALLING SLATES AND TILES AND HOLDING BY PEOPLE I MET AT ANGRY CORNERS COMING NEAR THE BEACH I SAW NOT ONLY THE BOATMEN BUT HALF THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN LURKING BEHIND BUILDINGS SOME NOW AND THEN BRAVING THE FURY OF THE STORM TO LOOK AWAY TO SEA AND BLOWN SHEER OUT OF THEIR COURSE IN TRYING TO GET ZIGZAG BACK JOINING THESE GROUPS I FOUND BEWAILING WOMEN WHOSE HUSBANDS WERE AWAY IN HERRING OR OYSTER BOATS WHICH THERE WAS TOO MUCH REASON TO THINK MIGHT HAVE FOUNDERED BEFORE THEY COULD RUN IN ANYWHERE FOR SAFETY GRIZZLED OLD SAILORS WERE AMONG THE PEOPLE SHAKING THEIR HEADS AS THEY LOOKED FROM WATER TO SKY AND MUTTERING TO ONE ANOTHER SHIPOWNERS EXCITED AND UNEASY CHILDREN HUDDLING TOGETHER AND PEERING INTO OLDER FACES EVEN STOUT MARINERS DISTURBED AND ANXIOUS LEVELLING THEIR GLASSES AT THE SEA FROM BEHIND PLACES OF SHELTER AS IF THEY WERE SURVEYING AN ENEMY THE TREMENDOUS SEA ITSELF WHEN I COULD FIND SUFFICIENT PAUSE TO LOOK AT IT IN THE AGITATION OF THE BLINDING WIND THE FLYING STONES AND SAND AND THE AWFUL NOISE CONFOUNDED ME AS THE HIGH WATERY WALLS CAME ROLLING IN AND AT THEIR HIGHEST TUMBLED INTO SURF THEY LOOKED AS IF THE LEAST WOULD ENGULF THE TOWN AS THE RECEDING WAVE SWEPT BACK WITH A HOARSE ROAR IT SEEMED TO SCOOP OUT DEEP CAVES IN THE BEACH AS IF ITS PURPOSE WERE TO UNDERMINE THE EARTH WHEN SOME WHITEHEADED BILLOWS THUNDERED ON AND DASHED THEMSELVES TO PIECES BEFORE THEY REACHED THE LAND EVERY FRAGMENT OF THE LATE WHOLE SEEMED POSSESSED BY THE FULL MIGHT OF ITS WRATH RUSHING TO BE GATHERED TO THE COMPOSITION OF ANOTHER MONSTER UNDULATING HILLS WERE CHANGED TO VALLEYS UNDULATING VALLEYS WITH A SOLITARY STORMBIRD SOMETIMES SKIMMING THROUGH THEM WERE LIFTED UP TO HILLS MASSES OF WATER SHIVERED AND SHOOK THE BEACH WITH A BOOMING SOUND EVERY SHAPE TUMULTUOUSLY ROLLED ON AS SOON AS MADE TO CHANGE ITS SHAPE AND PLACE AND BEAT ANOTHER SHAPE AND PLACE AWAY THE IDEAL SHORE ON THE HORIZON WITH ITS TOWERS AND BUILDINGS ROSE AND FELL THE CLOUDS FELL FAST AND THICK I SEEMED TO SEE A RENDING AND UPHEAVING OF ALL NATURE NOT FINDING HAM AMONG THE PEOPLE WHOM THIS MEMORABLE WINDFOR IT IS STILL REMEMBERED DOWN THERE AS THE GREATEST EVER KNOWN TO BLOW UPON THAT COASTHAD BROUGHT TOGETHER I MADE MY WAY TO HIS HOUSE IT WAS SHUT AND AS NO ONE ANSWERED TO MY KNOCKING I WENT BY BACK WAYS AND BYLANES TO THE YARD WHERE HE WORKED I LEARNED THERE THAT HE HAD GONE TO LOWESTOFT TO MEET SOME SUDDEN EXIGENCY OF SHIPREPAIRING IN WHICH HIS SKILL WAS REQUIRED BUT THAT HE WOULD BE BACK TOMORROW MORNING IN GOOD TIME I WENT BACK TO THE INN AND WHEN I HAD WASHED AND DRESSED AND TRIED TO SLEEP BUT IN VAIN IT WAS FIVE OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON I HAD NOT SAT FIVE MINUTES BY THE COFFEEROOM FIRE WHEN THE WAITER COMING TO STIR IT AS AN EXCUSE FOR TALKING TOLD ME THAT TWO COLLIERS HAD GONE DOWN WITH ALL HANDS A FEW MILES AWAY AND THAT SOME OTHER SHIPS HAD BEEN SEEN LABOURING HARD IN THE ROADS AND TRYING IN GREAT DISTRESS TO KEEP OFF SHORE MERCY ON THEM AND ON ALL POOR SAILORS SAID HE IF WE HAD ANOTHER NIGHT LIKE THE LAST I WAS VERY MUCH DEPRESSED IN SPIRITS VERY SOLITARY AND FELT AN UNEASINESS IN HAMS NOT BEING THERE DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE OCCASION I WAS SERIOUSLY AFFECTED WITHOUT KNOWING HOW MUCH BY LATE EVENTS AND MY LONG EXPOSURE TO THE FIERCE WIND HAD CONFUSED ME THERE WAS THAT JUMBLE IN MY THOUGHTS AND RECOLLECTIONS THAT I HAD LOST THE CLEAR ARRANGEMENT OF TIME AND DISTANCE THUS IF I HAD GONE OUT INTO THE TOWN I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED I THINK TO ENCOUNTER SOMEONE WHO I KNEW MUST BE THEN IN LONDON SO TO SPEAK THERE WAS IN THESE RESPECTS A CURIOUS INATTENTION IN MY MIND YET IT WAS BUSY TOO WITH ALL THE REMEMBRANCES THE PLACE NATURALLY AWAKENED AND THEY WERE PARTICULARLY DISTINCT AND VIVID IN THIS STATE THE WAITERS DISMAL INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE SHIPS IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED ITSELF WITHOUT ANY EFFORT OF MY VOLITION WITH MY UNEASINESS ABOUT HAM I WAS PERSUADED THAT I HAD AN APPREHENSION OF HIS RETURNING FROM LOWESTOFT BY SEA AND BEING LOST THIS GREW SO STRONG WITH ME THAT I RESOLVED TO GO BACK TO THE YARD BEFORE I TOOK MY DINNER AND ASK THE BOATBUILDER IF HE THOUGHT HIS ATTEMPTING TO RETURN BY SEA AT ALL LIKELY IF HE GAVE ME THE LEAST REASON TO THINK SO I WOULD GO OVER TO LOWESTOFT AND PREVENT IT BY BRINGING HIM WITH ME I HASTILY ORDERED MY DINNER AND WENT BACK TO THE YARD I WAS NONE TOO SOON FOR THE BOATBUILDER WITH A LANTERN IN HIS HAND WAS LOCKING THE YARDGATE HE QUITE LAUGHED WHEN I ASKED HIM THE QUESTION AND SAID THERE WAS NO FEAR NO MAN IN HIS SENSES OR OUT OF THEM WOULD PUT OFF IN SUCH A GALE OF WIND LEAST OF ALL HAM PEGGOTTY WHO HAD BEEN BORN TO SEAFARING SO SENSIBLE OF THIS BEFOREHAND THAT I HAD REALLY FELT ASHAMED OF DOING WHAT I WAS NEVERTHELESS IMPELLED TO DO I WENT BACK TO THE INN IF SUCH A WIND COULD RISE I THINK IT WAS RISING THE HOWL AND ROAR THE RATTLING OF THE DOORS AND WINDOWS THE RUMBLING IN THE CHIMNEYS THE APPARENT ROCKING OF THE VERY HOUSE THAT SHELTERED ME AND THE PRODIGIOUS TUMULT OF THE SEA WERE MORE FEARFUL THAN IN THE MORNING BUT THERE WAS NOW A GREAT DARKNESS BESIDES AND THAT INVESTED THE STORM WITH NEW TERRORS REAL AND FANCIFUL I COULD NOT EAT I COULD NOT SIT STILL I COULD NOT CONTINUE STEADFAST TO ANYTHING SOMETHING WITHIN ME FAINTLY ANSWERING TO THE STORM WITHOUT TOSSED UP THE DEPTHS OF MY MEMORY AND MADE A TUMULT IN THEM YET IN ALL THE HURRY OF MY THOUGHTS WILD RUNNING WITH THE THUNDERING SEATHE STORM AND MY UNEASINESS REGARDING HAM WERE ALWAYS IN THE FOREGROUND MY DINNER WENT AWAY ALMOST UNTASTED AND I TRIED TO REFRESH MYSELF WITH A GLASS OR TWO OF WINE IN VAIN I FELL INTO A DULL SLUMBER BEFORE THE FIRE WITHOUT LOSING MY CONSCIOUSNESS EITHER OF THE UPROAR OUT OF DOORS OR OF THE PLACE IN WHICH I WAS BOTH BECAME OVERSHADOWED BY A NEW AND INDEFINABLE HORROR AND WHEN I AWOKEOR RATHER WHEN I SHOOK OFF THE LETHARGY THAT BOUND ME IN MY CHAIRMY WHOLE FRAME THRILLED WITH OBJECTLESS AND UNINTELLIGIBLE FEAR I WALKED TO AND FRO TRIED TO READ AN OLD GAZETTEER LISTENED TO THE AWFUL NOISES LOOKED AT FACES SCENES AND FIGURES IN THE FIRE AT LENGTH THE STEADY TICKING OF THE UNDISTURBED CLOCK ON THE WALL TORMENTED ME TO THAT DEGREE THAT I RESOLVED TO GO TO BED IT WAS REASSURING ON SUCH A NIGHT TO BE TOLD THAT SOME OF THE INNSERVANTS HAD AGREED TOGETHER TO SIT UP UNTIL MORNING I WENT TO BED EXCEEDINGLY WEARY AND HEAVY BUT ON MY LYING DOWN ALL SUCH SENSATIONS VANISHED AS IF BY MAGIC AND I WAS BROAD AWAKE WITH EVERY SENSE REFINED FOR HOURS I LAY THERE LISTENING TO THE WIND AND WATER IMAGINING NOW THAT I HEARD SHRIEKS OUT AT SEA NOW THAT I DISTINCTLY HEARD THE FIRING OF SIGNAL GUNS AND NOW THE FALL OF HOUSES IN THE TOWN I GOT UP SEVERAL TIMES AND LOOKED OUT BUT COULD SEE NOTHING EXCEPT THE REFLECTION IN THE WINDOWPANES OF THE FAINT CANDLE I HAD LEFT BURNING AND OF MY OWN HAGGARD FACE LOOKING IN AT ME FROM THE BLACK VOID AT LENGTH MY RESTLESSNESS ATTAINED TO SUCH A PITCH THAT I HURRIED ON MY CLOTHES AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS IN THE LARGE KITCHEN WHERE I DIMLY SAW BACON AND ROPES OF ONIONS HANGING FROM THE BEAMS THE WATCHERS WERE CLUSTERED TOGETHER IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES ABOUT A TABLE PURPOSELY MOVED AWAY FROM THE GREAT CHIMNEY AND BROUGHT NEAR THE DOOR A PRETTY GIRL WHO HAD HER EARS STOPPED WITH HER APRON AND HER EYES UPON THE DOOR SCREAMED WHEN I APPEARED SUPPOSING ME TO BE A SPIRIT BUT THE OTHERS HAD MORE PRESENCE OF MIND AND WERE GLAD OF AN ADDITION TO THEIR COMPANY ONE MAN REFERRING TO THE TOPIC THEY HAD BEEN DISCUSSING ASKED ME WHETHER I THOUGHT THE SOULS OF THE COLLIERCREWS WHO HAD GONE DOWN WERE OUT IN THE STORM I REMAINED THERE I DARE SAY TWO HOURS ONCE I OPENED THE YARDGATE AND LOOKED INTO THE EMPTY STREET THE SAND THE SEAWEED AND THE FLAKES OF FOAM WERE DRIVING BY AND I WAS OBLIGED TO CALL FOR ASSISTANCE BEFORE I COULD SHUT THE GATE AGAIN AND MAKE IT FAST AGAINST THE WIND THERE WAS A DARK GLOOM IN MY SOLITARY CHAMBER WHEN I AT LENGTH RETURNED TO IT BUT I WAS TIRED NOW AND GETTING INTO BED AGAIN FELLOFF A TOWER AND DOWN A PRECIPICEINTO THE DEPTHS OF SLEEP I HAVE AN IMPRESSION THAT FOR A LONG TIME THOUGH I DREAMED OF BEING ELSEWHERE AND IN A VARIETY OF SCENES IT WAS ALWAYS BLOWING IN MY DREAM AT LENGTH I LOST THAT FEEBLE HOLD UPON REALITY AND WAS ENGAGED WITH TWO DEAR FRIENDS BUT WHO THEY WERE I DONT KNOW AT THE SIEGE OF SOME TOWN IN A ROAR OF CANNONADING THE THUNDER OF THE CANNON WAS SO LOUD AND INCESSANT THAT I COULD NOT HEAR SOMETHING I MUCH DESIRED TO HEAR UNTIL I MADE A GREAT EXERTION AND AWOKE IT WAS BROAD DAYEIGHT OR NINE OCLOCK THE STORM RAGING IN LIEU OF THE BATTERIES AND SOMEONE KNOCKING AND CALLING AT MY DOOR WHAT IS THE MATTER I CRIED A WRECK CLOSE BY I SPRUNG OUT OF BED AND ASKED WHAT WRECK A SCHOONER FROM SPAIN OR PORTUGAL LADEN WITH FRUIT AND WINE MAKE HASTE SIR IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER ITS THOUGHT DOWN ON THE BEACH SHELL GO TO PIECES EVERY MOMENT THE EXCITED VOICE WENT CLAMOURING ALONG THE STAIRCASE AND I WRAPPED MYSELF IN MY CLOTHES AS QUICKLY AS I COULD AND RAN INTO THE STREET NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE THERE BEFORE ME ALL RUNNING IN ONE DIRECTION TO THE BEACH I RAN THE SAME WAY OUTSTRIPPING A GOOD MANY AND SOON CAME FACING THE WILD SEA THE WIND MIGHT BY THIS TIME HAVE LULLED A LITTLE THOUGH NOT MORE SENSIBLY THAN IF THE CANNONADING I HAD DREAMED OF HAD BEEN DIMINISHED BY THE SILENCING OF HALFADOZEN GUNS OUT OF HUNDREDS BUT THE SEA HAVING UPON IT THE ADDITIONAL AGITATION OF THE WHOLE NIGHT WAS INFINITELY MORE TERRIFIC THAN WHEN I HAD SEEN IT LAST EVERY APPEARANCE IT HAD THEN PRESENTED BORE THE EXPRESSION OF BEING SWELLED AND THE HEIGHT TO WHICH THE BREAKERS ROSE AND LOOKING OVER ONE ANOTHER BORE ONE ANOTHER DOWN AND ROLLED IN IN INTERMINABLE HOSTS WAS MOST APPALLING IN THE DIFFICULTY OF HEARING ANYTHING BUT WIND AND WAVES AND IN THE CROWD AND THE UNSPEAKABLE CONFUSION AND MY FIRST BREATHLESS EFFORTS TO STAND AGAINST THE WEATHER I WAS SO CONFUSED THAT I LOOKED OUT TO SEA FOR THE WRECK AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE FOAMING HEADS OF THE GREAT WAVES A HALFDRESSED BOATMAN STANDING NEXT ME POINTED WITH HIS BARE ARM A TATTOOD ARROW ON IT POINTING IN THE SAME DIRECTION TO THE LEFT THEN O GREAT HEAVEN I SAW IT CLOSE IN UPON US ONE MAST WAS BROKEN SHORT OFF SIX OR EIGHT FEET FROM THE DECK AND LAY OVER THE SIDE ENTANGLED IN A MAZE OF SAIL AND RIGGING AND ALL THAT RUIN AS THE SHIP ROLLED AND BEATWHICH SHE DID WITHOUT A MOMENTS PAUSE AND WITH A VIOLENCE QUITE INCONCEIVABLEBEAT THE SIDE AS IF IT WOULD STAVE IT IN SOME EFFORTS WERE EVEN THEN BEING MADE TO CUT THIS PORTION OF THE WRECK AWAY FOR AS THE SHIP WHICH WAS BROADSIDE ON TURNED TOWARDS US IN HER ROLLING I PLAINLY DESCRIED HER PEOPLE AT WORK WITH AXES ESPECIALLY ONE ACTIVE FIGURE WITH LONG CURLING HAIR CONSPICUOUS AMONG THE REST BUT A GREAT CRY WHICH WAS AUDIBLE EVEN ABOVE THE WIND AND WATER ROSE FROM THE SHORE AT THIS MOMENT THE SEA SWEEPING OVER THE ROLLING WRECK MADE A CLEAN BREACH AND CARRIED MEN SPARS CASKS PLANKS BULWARKS HEAPS OF SUCH TOYS INTO THE BOILING SURGE THE SECOND MAST WAS YET STANDING WITH THE RAGS OF A RENT SAIL AND A WILD CONFUSION OF BROKEN CORDAGE FLAPPING TO AND FRO THE SHIP HAD STRUCK ONCE THE SAME BOATMAN HOARSELY SAID IN MY EAR AND THEN LIFTED IN AND STRUCK AGAIN I UNDERSTOOD HIM TO ADD THAT SHE WAS PARTING AMIDSHIPS AND I COULD READILY SUPPOSE SO FOR THE ROLLING AND BEATING WERE TOO TREMENDOUS FOR ANY HUMAN WORK TO SUFFER LONG AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS ANOTHER GREAT CRY OF PITY FROM THE BEACH FOUR MEN AROSE WITH THE WRECK OUT OF THE DEEP CLINGING TO THE RIGGING OF THE REMAINING MAST UPPERMOST THE ACTIVE FIGURE WITH THE CURLING HAIR THERE WAS A BELL ON BOARD AND AS THE SHIP ROLLED AND DASHED LIKE A DESPERATE CREATURE DRIVEN MAD NOW SHOWING US THE WHOLE SWEEP OF HER DECK AS SHE TURNED ON HER BEAMENDS TOWARDS THE SHORE NOW NOTHING BUT HER KEEL AS SHE SPRUNG WILDLY OVER AND TURNED TOWARDS THE SEA THE BELL RANG AND ITS SOUND THE KNELL OF THOSE UNHAPPY MEN WAS BORNE TOWARDS US ON THE WIND AGAIN WE LOST HER AND AGAIN SHE ROSE TWO MEN WERE GONE THE AGONY ON THE SHORE INCREASED MEN GROANED AND CLASPED THEIR HANDS WOMEN SHRIEKED AND TURNED AWAY THEIR FACES SOME RAN WILDLY UP AND DOWN ALONG THE BEACH CRYING FOR HELP WHERE NO HELP COULD BE I FOUND MYSELF ONE OF THESE FRANTICALLY IMPLORING A KNOT OF SAILORS WHOM I KNEW NOT TO LET THOSE TWO LOST CREATURES PERISH BEFORE OUR EYES THEY WERE MAKING OUT TO ME IN AN AGITATED WAYI DONT KNOW HOW FOR THE LITTLE I COULD HEAR I WAS SCARCELY COMPOSED ENOUGH TO UNDERSTANDTHAT THE LIFEBOAT HAD BEEN BRAVELY MANNED AN HOUR AGO AND COULD DO NOTHING AND THAT AS NO MAN WOULD BE SO DESPERATE AS TO ATTEMPT TO WADE OFF WITH A ROPE AND ESTABLISH A COMMUNICATION WITH THE SHORE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO TRY WHEN I NOTICED THAT SOME NEW SENSATION MOVED THE PEOPLE ON THE BEACH AND SAW THEM PART AND HAM COME BREAKING THROUGH THEM TO THE FRONT I RAN TO HIMAS WELL AS I KNOW TO REPEAT MY APPEAL FOR HELP BUT DISTRACTED THOUGH I WAS BY A SIGHT SO NEW TO ME AND TERRIBLE THE DETERMINATION IN HIS FACE AND HIS LOOK OUT TO SEAEXACTLY THE SAME LOOK AS I REMEMBERED IN CONNEXION WITH THE MORNING AFTER EMILYS FLIGHTAWOKE ME TO A KNOWLEDGE OF HIS DANGER I HELD HIM BACK WITH BOTH ARMS AND IMPLORED THE MEN WITH WHOM I HAD BEEN SPEAKING NOT TO LISTEN TO HIM NOT TO DO MURDER NOT TO LET HIM STIR FROM OFF THAT SAND ANOTHER CRY AROSE ON SHORE AND LOOKING TO THE WRECK WE SAW THE CRUEL SAIL WITH BLOW ON BLOW BEAT OFF THE LOWER OF THE TWO MEN AND FLY UP IN TRIUMPH ROUND THE ACTIVE FIGURE LEFT ALONE UPON THE MAST AGAINST SUCH A SIGHT AND AGAINST SUCH DETERMINATION AS THAT OF THE CALMLY DESPERATE MAN WHO WAS ALREADY ACCUSTOMED TO LEAD HALF THE PEOPLE PRESENT I MIGHT AS HOPEFULLY HAVE ENTREATED THE WIND MASR DAVY HE SAID CHEERILY GRASPING ME BY BOTH HANDS IF MY TIME IS COME TIS COME IF TANT ILL BIDE IT LORD ABOVE BLESS YOU AND BLESS ALL MATES MAKE ME READY IM AGOING OFF I WAS SWEPT AWAY BUT NOT UNKINDLY TO SOME DISTANCE WHERE THE PEOPLE AROUND ME MADE ME STAY URGING AS I CONFUSEDLY PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS BENT ON GOING WITH HELP OR WITHOUT AND THAT I SHOULD ENDANGER THE PRECAUTIONS FOR HIS SAFETY BY TROUBLING THOSE WITH WHOM THEY RESTED I DONT KNOW WHAT I ANSWERED OR WHAT THEY REJOINED BUT I SAW HURRY ON THE BEACH AND MEN RUNNING WITH ROPES FROM A CAPSTAN THAT WAS THERE AND PENETRATING INTO A CIRCLE OF FIGURES THAT HID HIM FROM ME THEN I SAW HIM STANDING ALONE IN A SEAMANS FROCK AND TROUSERS A ROPE IN HIS HAND OR SLUNG TO HIS WRIST ANOTHER ROUND HIS BODY AND SEVERAL OF THE BEST MEN HOLDING AT A LITTLE DISTANCE TO THE LATTER WHICH HE LAID OUT HIMSELF SLACK UPON THE SHORE AT HIS FEET THE WRECK EVEN TO MY UNPRACTISED EYE WAS BREAKING UP I SAW THAT SHE WAS PARTING IN THE MIDDLE AND THAT THE LIFE OF THE SOLITARY MAN UPON THE MAST HUNG BY A THREAD STILL HE CLUNG TO IT HE HAD A SINGULAR RED CAP ONNOT LIKE A SAILORS CAP BUT OF A FINER COLOUR AND AS THE FEW YIELDING PLANKS BETWEEN HIM AND DESTRUCTION ROLLED AND BULGED AND HIS ANTICIPATIVE DEATHKNELL RUNG HE WAS SEEN BY ALL OF US TO WAVE IT I SAW HIM DO IT NOW AND THOUGHT I WAS GOING DISTRACTED WHEN HIS ACTION BROUGHT AN OLD REMEMBRANCE TO MY MIND OF A ONCE DEAR FRIEND HAM WATCHED THE SEA STANDING ALONE WITH THE SILENCE OF SUSPENDED BREATH BEHIND HIM AND THE STORM BEFORE UNTIL THERE WAS A GREAT RETIRING WAVE WHEN WITH A BACKWARD GLANCE AT THOSE WHO HELD THE ROPE WHICH WAS MADE FAST ROUND HIS BODY HE DASHED IN AFTER IT AND IN A MOMENT WAS BUFFETING WITH THE WATER RISING WITH THE HILLS FALLING WITH THE VALLEYS LOST BENEATH THE FOAM THEN DRAWN AGAIN TO LAND THEY HAULED IN HASTILY HE WAS HURT I SAW BLOOD ON HIS FACE FROM WHERE I STOOD BUT HE TOOK NO THOUGHT OF THAT HE SEEMED HURRIEDLY TO GIVE THEM SOME DIRECTIONS FOR LEAVING HIM MORE FREEOR SO I JUDGED FROM THE MOTION OF HIS ARMAND WAS GONE AS BEFORE AND NOW HE MADE FOR THE WRECK RISING WITH THE HILLS FALLING WITH THE VALLEYS LOST BENEATH THE RUGGED FOAM BORNE IN TOWARDS THE SHORE BORNE ON TOWARDS THE SHIP STRIVING HARD AND VALIANTLY THE DISTANCE WAS NOTHING BUT THE POWER OF THE SEA AND WIND MADE THE STRIFE DEADLY AT LENGTH HE NEARED THE WRECK HE WAS SO NEAR THAT WITH ONE MORE OF HIS VIGOROUS STROKES HE WOULD BE CLINGING TO ITWHEN A HIGH GREEN VAST HILLSIDE OF WATER MOVING ON SHOREWARD FROM BEYOND THE SHIP HE SEEMED TO LEAP UP INTO IT WITH A MIGHTY BOUND AND THE SHIP WAS GONE SOME EDDYING FRAGMENTS I SAW IN THE SEA AS IF A MERE CASK HAD BEEN BROKEN IN RUNNING TO THE SPOT WHERE THEY WERE HAULING IN CONSTERNATION WAS IN EVERY FACE THEY DREW HIM TO MY VERY FEETINSENSIBLEDEAD HE WAS CARRIED TO THE NEAREST HOUSE AND NO ONE PREVENTING ME NOW I REMAINED NEAR HIM BUSY WHILE EVERY MEANS OF RESTORATION WERE TRIED BUT HE HAD BEEN BEATEN TO DEATH BY THE GREAT WAVE AND HIS GENEROUS HEART WAS STILLED FOR EVER AS I SAT BESIDE THE BED WHEN HOPE WAS ABANDONED AND ALL WAS DONE A FISHERMAN WHO HAD KNOWN ME WHEN EMILY AND I WERE CHILDREN AND EVER SINCE WHISPERED MY NAME AT THE DOOR SIR SAID HE WITH TEARS STARTING TO HIS WEATHERBEATEN FACE WHICH WITH HIS TREMBLING LIPS WAS ASHY PALE WILL YOU COME OVER YONDER THE OLD REMEMBRANCE THAT HAD BEEN RECALLED TO ME WAS IN HIS LOOK I ASKED HIM TERRORSTRICKEN LEANING ON THE ARM HE HELD OUT TO SUPPORT ME HAS A BODY COME ASHORE HE SAID YES DO I KNOW IT I ASKED THEN HE ANSWERED NOTHING BUT HE LED ME TO THE SHORE AND ON THAT PART OF IT WHERE SHE AND I HAD LOOKED FOR SHELLS TWO CHILDRENON THAT PART OF IT WHERE SOME LIGHTER FRAGMENTS OF THE OLD BOAT BLOWN DOWN LAST NIGHT HAD BEEN SCATTERED BY THE WINDAMONG THE RUINS OF THE HOME HE HAD WRONGEDI SAW HIM LYING WITH HIS HEAD UPON HIS ARM AS I HAD OFTEN SEEN HIM LIE AT SCHOOL CHAPTER THE NEW WOUND AND THE OLD NO NEED O STEERFORTH TO HAVE SAID WHEN WE LAST SPOKE TOGETHER IN THAT HOUR WHICH I SO LITTLE DEEMED TO BE OUR PARTINGHOURNO NEED TO HAVE SAID THINK OF ME AT MY BEST I HAD DONE THAT EVER AND COULD I CHANGE NOW LOOKING ON THIS SIGHT THEY BROUGHT A HANDBIER AND LAID HIM ON IT AND COVERED HIM WITH A FLAG AND TOOK HIM UP AND BORE HIM ON TOWARDS THE HOUSES ALL THE MEN WHO CARRIED HIM HAD KNOWN HIM AND GONE SAILING WITH HIM AND SEEN HIM MERRY AND BOLD THEY CARRIED HIM THROUGH THE WILD ROAR A HUSH IN THE MIDST OF ALL THE TUMULT AND TOOK HIM TO THE COTTAGE WHERE DEATH WAS ALREADY BUT WHEN THEY SET THE BIER DOWN ON THE THRESHOLD THEY LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND AT ME AND WHISPERED I KNEW WHY THEY FELT AS IF IT WERE NOT RIGHT TO LAY HIM DOWN IN THE SAME QUIET ROOM WE WENT INTO THE TOWN AND TOOK OUR BURDEN TO THE INN SO SOON AS I COULD AT ALL COLLECT MY THOUGHTS I SENT FOR JORAM AND BEGGED HIM TO PROVIDE ME A CONVEYANCE IN WHICH IT COULD BE GOT TO LONDON IN THE NIGHT I KNEW THAT THE CARE OF IT AND THE HARD DUTY OF PREPARING HIS MOTHER TO RECEIVE IT COULD ONLY REST WITH ME AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO DISCHARGE THAT DUTY AS FAITHFULLY AS I COULD I CHOSE THE NIGHT FOR THE JOURNEY THAT THERE MIGHT BE LESS CURIOSITY WHEN I LEFT THE TOWN BUT ALTHOUGH IT WAS NEARLY MIDNIGHT WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE YARD IN A CHAISE FOLLOWED BY WHAT I HAD IN CHARGE THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WAITING AT INTERVALS ALONG THE TOWN AND EVEN A LITTLE WAY OUT UPON THE ROAD I SAW MORE BUT AT LENGTH ONLY THE BLEAK NIGHT AND THE OPEN COUNTRY WERE AROUND ME AND THE ASHES OF MY YOUTHFUL FRIENDSHIP UPON A MELLOW AUTUMN DAY ABOUT NOON WHEN THE GROUND WAS PERFUMED BY FALLEN LEAVES AND MANY MORE IN BEAUTIFUL TINTS OF YELLOW RED AND BROWN YET HUNG UPON THE TREES THROUGH WHICH THE SUN WAS SHINING I ARRIVED AT HIGHGATE I WALKED THE LAST MILE THINKING AS I WENT ALONG OF WHAT I HAD TO DO AND LEFT THE CARRIAGE THAT HAD FOLLOWED ME ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT AWAITING ORDERS TO ADVANCE THE HOUSE WHEN I CAME UP TO IT LOOKED JUST THE SAME NOT A BLIND WAS RAISED NO SIGN OF LIFE WAS IN THE DULL PAVED COURT WITH ITS COVERED WAY LEADING TO THE DISUSED DOOR THE WIND HAD QUITE GONE DOWN AND NOTHING MOVED I HAD NOT AT FIRST THE COURAGE TO RING AT THE GATE AND WHEN I DID RING MY ERRAND SEEMED TO ME TO BE EXPRESSED IN THE VERY SOUND OF THE BELL THE LITTLE PARLOURMAID CAME OUT WITH THE KEY IN HER HAND AND LOOKING EARNESTLY AT ME AS SHE UNLOCKED THE GATE SAID I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR ARE YOU ILL I HAVE BEEN MUCH AGITATED AND AM FATIGUED IS ANYTHING THE MATTER SIRMR JAMES HUSH SAID I YES SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THAT I HAVE TO BREAK TO MRS STEERFORTH SHE IS AT HOME THE GIRL ANXIOUSLY REPLIED THAT HER MISTRESS WAS VERY SELDOM OUT NOW EVEN IN A CARRIAGE THAT SHE KEPT HER ROOM THAT SHE SAW NO COMPANY BUT WOULD SEE ME HER MISTRESS WAS UP SHE SAID AND MISS DARTLE WAS WITH HER WHAT MESSAGE SHOULD SHE TAKE UPSTAIRS GIVING HER A STRICT CHARGE TO BE CAREFUL OF HER MANNER AND ONLY TO CARRY IN MY CARD AND SAY I WAITED I SAT DOWN IN THE DRAWINGROOM WHICH WE HAD NOW REACHED UNTIL SHE SHOULD COME BACK ITS FORMER PLEASANT AIR OF OCCUPATION WAS GONE AND THE SHUTTERS WERE HALF CLOSED THE HARP HAD NOT BEEN USED FOR MANY AND MANY A DAY HIS PICTURE AS A BOY WAS THERE THE CABINET IN WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD KEPT HIS LETTERS WAS THERE I WONDERED IF SHE EVER READ THEM NOW IF SHE WOULD EVER READ THEM MORE THE HOUSE WAS SO STILL THAT I HEARD THE GIRLS LIGHT STEP UPSTAIRS ON HER RETURN SHE BROUGHT A MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT THAT MRS STEERFORTH WAS AN INVALID AND COULD NOT COME DOWN BUT THAT IF I WOULD EXCUSE HER BEING IN HER CHAMBER SHE WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE ME IN A FEW MOMENTS I STOOD BEFORE HER SHE WAS IN HIS ROOM NOT IN HER OWN I FELT OF COURSE THAT SHE HAD TAKEN TO OCCUPY IT IN REMEMBRANCE OF HIM AND THAT THE MANY TOKENS OF HIS OLD SPORTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS BY WHICH SHE WAS SURROUNDED REMAINED THERE JUST AS HE HAD LEFT THEM FOR THE SAME REASON SHE MURMURED HOWEVER EVEN IN HER RECEPTION OF ME THAT SHE WAS OUT OF HER OWN CHAMBER BECAUSE ITS ASPECT WAS UNSUITED TO HER INFIRMITY AND WITH HER STATELY LOOK REPELLED THE LEAST SUSPICION OF THE TRUTH AT HER CHAIR AS USUAL WAS ROSA DARTLE FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF HER DARK EYES RESTING ON ME I SAW SHE KNEW I WAS THE BEARER OF EVIL TIDINGS THE SCAR SPRUNG INTO VIEW THAT INSTANT SHE WITHDREW HERSELF A STEP BEHIND THE CHAIR TO KEEP HER OWN FACE OUT OF MRS STEERFORTHS OBSERVATION AND SCRUTINIZED ME WITH A PIERCING GAZE THAT NEVER FALTERED NEVER SHRUNK I AM SORRY TO OBSERVE YOU ARE IN MOURNING SIR SAID MRS STEERFORTH I AM UNHAPPILY A WIDOWER SAID I YOU ARE VERY YOUNG TO KNOW SO GREAT A LOSS SHE RETURNED I AM GRIEVED TO HEAR IT I AM GRIEVED TO HEAR IT I HOPE TIME WILL BE GOOD TO YOU I HOPE TIME SAID I LOOKING AT HER WILL BE GOOD TO ALL OF US DEAR MRS STEERFORTH WE MUST ALL TRUST TO THAT IN OUR HEAVIEST MISFORTUNES THE EARNESTNESS OF MY MANNER AND THE TEARS IN MY EYES ALARMED HER THE WHOLE COURSE OF HER THOUGHTS APPEARED TO STOP AND CHANGE I TRIED TO COMMAND MY VOICE IN GENTLY SAYING HIS NAME BUT IT TREMBLED SHE REPEATED IT TO HERSELF TWO OR THREE TIMES IN A LOW TONE THEN ADDRESSING ME SHE SAID WITH ENFORCED CALMNESS MY SON IS ILL VERY ILL YOU HAVE SEEN HIM I HAVE ARE YOU RECONCILED I COULD NOT SAY YES I COULD NOT SAY NO SHE SLIGHTLY TURNED HER HEAD TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE ROSA DARTLE HAD BEEN STANDING AT HER ELBOW AND IN THAT MOMENT I SAID BY THE MOTION OF MY LIPS TO ROSA DEAD THAT MRS STEERFORTH MIGHT NOT BE INDUCED TO LOOK BEHIND HER AND READ PLAINLY WRITTEN WHAT SHE WAS NOT YET PREPARED TO KNOW I MET HER LOOK QUICKLY BUT I HAD SEEN ROSA DARTLE THROW HER HANDS UP IN THE AIR WITH VEHEMENCE OF DESPAIR AND HORROR AND THEN CLASP THEM ON HER FACE THE HANDSOME LADYSO LIKE OH SO LIKEREGARDED ME WITH A FIXED LOOK AND PUT HER HAND TO HER FOREHEAD I BESOUGHT HER TO BE CALM AND PREPARE HERSELF TO BEAR WHAT I HAD TO TELL BUT I SHOULD RATHER HAVE ENTREATED HER TO WEEP FOR SHE SAT LIKE A STONE FIGURE WHEN I WAS LAST HERE I FALTERED MISS DARTLE TOLD ME HE WAS SAILING HERE AND THERE THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST WAS A DREADFUL ONE AT SEA IF HE WERE AT

NEWSPAPER THROUGH WHICH IT MIGHT WITHOUT SUCH PRECAUTIONS REACH HIM IF IT PENETRATES TO HIM SIR SAID MR MICAWBER STRIKING HIMSELF ON THE BREAST IT SHALL FIRST PASS THROUGH THIS BODY MR MICAWBER I MUST OBSERVE IN HIS ADAPTATION OF HIMSELF TO A NEW STATE OF SOCIETY HAD ACQUIRED A BOLD BUCCANEERING AIR NOT ABSOLUTELY LAWLESS BUT DEFENSIVE AND PROMPT ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED HIM A CHILD OF THE WILDERNESS LONG ACCUSTOMED TO LIVE OUT OF THE CONFINES OF CIVILIZATION AND ABOUT TO RETURN TO HIS NATIVE WILDS HE HAD PROVIDED HIMSELF AMONG OTHER THINGS WITH A COMPLETE SUIT OF OILSKIN AND A STRAW HAT WITH A VERY LOW CROWN PITCHED OR CAULKED ON THE OUTSIDE IN THIS ROUGH CLOTHING WITH A COMMON MARINERS TELESCOPE UNDER HIS ARM AND A SHREWD TRICK OF CASTING UP HIS EYE AT THE SKY AS LOOKING OUT FOR DIRTY WEATHER HE WAS FAR MORE NAUTICAL AFTER HIS MANNER THAN MR PEGGOTTY HIS WHOLE FAMILY IF I MAY SO EXPRESS IT WERE CLEARED FOR ACTION I FOUND MRS MICAWBER IN THE CLOSEST AND MOST UNCOMPROMISING OF BONNETS MADE FAST UNDER THE CHIN AND IN A SHAWL WHICH TIED HER UP AS I HAD BEEN TIED UP WHEN MY AUNT FIRST RECEIVED ME LIKE A BUNDLE AND WAS SECURED BEHIND AT THE WAIST IN A STRONG KNOT MISS MICAWBER

CHILDREN WERE DONE UP LIKE PRESERVED MEATS IN IMPERVIOUS CASES BOTH MR MICAWBER AND HIS ELDEST SON WORE THEIR SLEEVES LOOSELY TURNED BACK AT THE WRISTS AS BEING READY TO LEND A HAND IN ANY DIRECTION AND TO TUMBLE UP OR SING OUT YEOHEAVEYEO ON THE SHORTEST NOTICE THUS TRADDLES AND I FOUND THEM AT NIGHTFALL ASSEMBLED ON THE WOODEN STEPS AT THAT TIME KNOWN AS HUNGERFORD STAIRS WATCHING THE DEPARTURE OF A BOAT WITH SOME OF THEIR PROPERTY ON BOARD I HAD TOLD TRADDLES OF THE TERRIBLE EVENT AND IT HAD GREATLY SHOCKED HIM BUT THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF THE KINDNESS OF KEEPING IT A SECRET AND HE HAD COME TO HELP ME IN THIS LAST SERVICE IT WAS HERE THAT I TOOK MR MICAWBER ASIDE AND RECEIVED HIS PROMISE THE MICAWBER FAMILY WERE LODGED IN A LITTLE DIRTY TUMBLEDOWN PUBLICHOUSE WHICH IN THOSE DAYS WAS CLOSE TO THE STAIRS AND WHOSE PROTRUDING WOODEN ROOMS OVERHUNG THE RIVER THE FAMILY AS EMIGRANTS BEING OBJECTS OF SOME INTEREST IN AND ABOUT HUNGERFORD ATTRACTED SO MANY BEHOLDERS THAT WE WERE GLAD TO TAKE REFUGE IN THEIR ROOM IT WAS ONE OF THE WOODEN CHAMBERS UPSTAIRS WITH THE TIDE FLOWING UNDERNEATH MY AUNT AND AGNES WERE THERE BUSILY MAKING SOME LITTLE EXTRA COMFORTS IN THE WAY OF DRESS FOR THE CHILDREN PEGGOTTY WAS QUIETLY ASSISTING WITH THE OLD INSENSIBLE WORKBOX YARDMEASURE AND BIT OF WAXCANDLE BEFORE HER THAT HAD NOW OUTLIVED SO MUCH IT WAS NOT EASY TO ANSWER HER INQUIRIES STILL LESS TO WHISPER MR PEGGOTTY WHEN MR MICAWBER BROUGHT HIM IN THAT I HAD GIVEN THE LETTER AND ALL WAS WELL BUT I DID BOTH AND MADE THEM HAPPY IF I SHOWED ANY TRACE OF WHAT I FELT MY OWN SORROWS WERE SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR IT AND WHEN DOES THE SHIP SAIL MR MICAWBER ASKED MY AUNT MR MICAWBER CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO PREPARE EITHER MY AUNT OR HIS WIFE BY DEGREES AND SAID SOONER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED

QUITE AT HOME AND IN DUE TIME RETURNED WITH A STEAMING JUG I COULD NOT BUT OBSERVE THAT HE HAD BEEN PEELING THE LEMONS WITH HIS OWN CLASPKNIFE WHICH AS BECAME THE KNIFE OF A PRACTICAL SETTLER WAS ABOUT A FOOT LONG AND WHICH HE WIPED NOT WHOLLY WITHOUT OSTENTATION ON THE SLEEVE OF HIS COAT MRS MICAWBER AND THE TWO ELDER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY I NOW FOUND TO BE PROVIDED WITH SIMILAR FORMIDABLE INSTRUMENTS WHILE EVERY CHILD HAD ITS OWN WOODEN SPOON ATTACHED TO ITS BODY BY A STRONG LINE IN A SIMILAR ANTICIPATION OF LIFE AFLOAT AND IN THE BUSH MR MICAWBER INSTEAD OF HELPING MRS MICAWBER AND HIS ELDEST SON AND DAUGHTER TO PUNCH IN WINEGLASSES WHICH HE MIGHT EASILY HAVE DONE FOR THERE WAS A SHELFFULL IN THE ROOM SERVED IT OUT TO THEM IN A SERIES OF VILLAINOUS LITTLE TIN POTS AND I NEVER SAW HIM ENJOY ANYTHING SO MUCH AS DRINKING OUT OF HIS OWN PARTICULAR PINT POT AND PUTTING IT IN HIS POCKET AT THE CLOSE OF THE EVENING THE LUXURIES OF THE OLD COUNTRY SAID MR MICAWBER WITH AN INTENSE SATISFACTION IN THEIR RENOUNCEMENT WE ABANDON THE DENIZENS OF THE FOREST CANNOT OF COURSE EXPECT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REFINEMENTS OF THE LAND OF THE FREE HERE A BOY CAME IN TO SAY THAT MR MICAWBER

MANNER HEEP V MICAWBER FROM THIS DOCUMENT I LEARNED THAT MR MICAWBER BEING AGAIN ARRESTED WAS IN A FINAL PAROXYSM OF DESPAIR AND THAT HE BEGGED ME TO SEND HIM HIS KNIFE AND PINT POT BY BEARER AS THEY MIGHT PROVE SERVICEABLE DURING THE BRIEF REMAINDER OF HIS EXISTENCE IN JAIL HE ALSO REQUESTED AS A LAST ACT OF FRIENDSHIP THAT I WOULD SEE HIS FAMILY TO THE PARISH WORKHOUSE AND FORGET THAT SUCH A BEING EVER LIVED OF COURSE I ANSWERED THIS NOTE BY GOING DOWN WITH THE BOY TO PAY THE MONEY WHERE I FOUND MR MICAWBER SITTING IN A CORNER LOOKING DARKLY AT THE SHERIFF S OFFICER WHO HAD EFFECTED THE CAPTURE ON HIS RELEASE HE EMBRACED ME WITH THE UTMOST FERVOUR AND MADE AN ENTRY OF THE TRANSACTION IN HIS POCKETBOOKBEING VERY PARTICULAR I RECOLLECT ABOUT A HALFPENNY I INADVERTENTLY OMITTED FROM MY STATEMENT OF THE TOTAL THIS MOMENTOUS POCKETBOOK WAS A TIMELY REMINDER TO HIM OF ANOTHER TRANSACTION ON OUR RETURN TO THE ROOM UPSTAIRS WHERE HE ACCOUNTED FOR HIS ABSENCE BY SAYING THAT IT HAD BEEN OCCASIONED BY CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH HE HAD NO CONTROL HE TOOK OUT OF IT A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER FOLDED SMALL AND QUITE COVERED WITH LONG SUMS CAREFULLY WORKED FROM THE GLIMPSE I HAD OF THEM I SHOULD SAY THAT I NEVER SAW SUCH SUMS OUT OF A SCHOOL CIPHERINGBOOK THESE IT SEEMED WERE CALCULATIONS OF COMPOUND INTEREST ON WHAT HE CALLED THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF FORTYONE TEN ELEVEN AND A HALF FOR VARIOUS PERIODS AFTER A CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THESE AND AN ELABORATE ESTIMATE OF HIS RESOURCES HE HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION TO SELECT THAT SUM WHICH REPRESENTED THE AMOUNT WITH COMPOUND INTEREST TO TWO YEARS FIFTEEN CALENDAR MONTHS AND FOURTEEN DAYS FROM THAT DATE FOR THIS HE HAD DRAWN A NOTEOFHAND WITH GREAT NEATNESS WHICH HE HANDED OVER TO TRADDLES ON THE SPOT A DISCHARGE OF HIS DEBT IN FULL AS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN WITH MANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I HAVE STILL A PRESENTIMENT SAID MRS MICAWBER PENSIVELY SHAKING HER HEAD THAT MY FAMILY WILL APPEAR ON BOARD BEFORE WE FINALLY DEPART MR MICAWBER

AND MRS MICAWBER IN DRINKING TO ALL OF US IN RETURN AND WHEN HE AND THE MICAWBERS CORDIALLY SHOOK HANDS AS COMRADES AND HIS BROWN FACE BRIGHTENED WITH A SMILE I FELT THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS WAY ESTABLISH A GOOD NAME AND BE BELOVED GO WHERE HE WOULD EVEN THE CHILDREN WERE INSTRUCTED EACH TO DIP A WOODEN SPOON INTO MR MICAWBERS POT AND PLEDGE US IN ITS CONTENTS WHEN THIS WAS DONE MY AUNT AND AGNES ROSE AND PARTED FROM THE EMIGRANTS IT WAS A SORROWFUL FAREWELL THEY WERE ALL CRYING THE CHILDREN HUNG ABOUT AGNES TO THE LAST AND WE LEFT POOR MRS MICAWBER IN A VERY DISTRESSED CONDITION SOBBING AND WEEPING BY A DIM CANDLE THAT MUST HAVE MADE THE ROOM LOOK FROM THE RIVER LIKE A MISERABLE LIGHTHOUSE I WENT DOWN AGAIN NEXT MORNING TO SEE THAT THEY WERE AWAY THEY HAD DEPARTED IN A BOAT AS EARLY AS FIVE OCLOCK IT WAS A WONDERFUL INSTANCE TO ME OF THE GAP SUCH PARTINGS MAKE THAT ALTHOUGH MY ASSOCIATION OF THEM WITH THE TUMBLEDOWN PUBLICHOUSE AND THE WOODEN STAIRS DATED ONLY FROM LAST NIGHT BOTH SEEMED DREARY AND DESERTED NOW THAT THEY WERE GONE IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE NEXT DAY MY OLD NURSE AND I WENT DOWN TO GRAVESEND WE FOUND THE SHIP IN THE RIVER SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF BOATS A FAVOURABLE WIND BLOWING THE SIGNAL FOR SAILING AT HER MASTHEAD I HIRED A BOAT DIRECTLY AND WE PUT OFF TO HER AND GETTING THROUGH THE LITTLE VORTEX OF CONFUSION OF WHICH SHE WAS THE CENTRE WENT ON BOARD MR PEGGOTTY WAS WAITING FOR US ON DECK HE TOLD ME THAT MR MICAWBER HAD JUST NOW BEEN ARRESTED AGAIN AND FOR THE LAST TIME AT THE SUIT OF HEEP AND THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH A REQUEST I HAD MADE TO HIM HE HAD PAID THE MONEY WHICH I REPAID HIM HE THEN TOOK US DOWN BETWEEN DECKS AND THERE ANY LINGERING FEARS I HAD OF HIS HAVING HEARD ANY RUMOURS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED WERE DISPELLED BY MR MICAWBERS COMING OUT OF THE GLOOM TAKING HIS ARM WITH AN AIR OF FRIENDSHIP AND PROTECTION AND TELLING ME THAT THEY HAD SCARCELY BEEN ASUNDER FOR A MOMENT SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST IT WAS SUCH A STRANGE SCENE TO ME AND SO CONFINED AND DARK THAT AT FIRST I COULD MAKE OUT HARDLY ANYTHING BUT BY DEGREES IT CLEARED AS MY EYES BECAME MORE ACCUSTOMED TO THE GLOOM AND I SEEMED TO STAND IN A PICTURE BY OSTADE AMONG THE GREAT BEAMS BULKS AND RINGBOLTS OF THE SHIP AND THE EMIGRANTBERTHS AND CHESTS AND BUNDLES AND BARRELS AND HEAPS OF MISCELLANEOUS BAGGAGELIGHTED UP HERE AND THERE BY DANGLING LANTERNS AND ELSEWHERE BY THE YELLOW DAYLIGHT STRAYING DOWN A WINDSAIL OR A HATCHWAYWERE CROWDED GROUPS OF PEOPLE MAKING NEW FRIENDSHIPS TAKING LEAVE OF ONE ANOTHER TALKING LAUGHING CRYING EATING AND DRINKING SOME ALREADY SETTLED DOWN INTO THE POSSESSION OF THEIR FEW FEET OF SPACE WITH THEIR LITTLE HOUSEHOLDS ARRANGED AND TINY CHILDREN ESTABLISHED ON STOOLS OR IN DWARF ELBOWCHAIRS OTHERS DESPAIRING OF A RESTINGPLACE AND WANDERING DISCONSOLATELY FROM BABIES WHO HAD BUT A WEEK OR TWO OF LIFE BEHIND THEM TO CROOKED OLD MEN AND WOMEN WHO SEEMED TO HAVE BUT A WEEK OR TWO OF LIFE BEFORE THEM AND FROM PLOUGHMEN BODILY CARRYING OUT SOIL OF ENGLAND ON THEIR BOOTS TO SMITHS TAKING AWAY SAMPLES OF ITS SOOT AND SMOKE UPON THEIR SKINS EVERY AGE AND OCCUPATION APPEARED TO BE CRAMMED INTO THE NARROW COMPASS OF THE TWEEN DECKS AS MY EYE GLANCED ROUND THIS PLACE I THOUGHT I SAW SITTING BY AN OPEN PORT WITH ONE OF THE MICAWBER CHILDREN NEAR HER A FIGURE LIKE EMILYS IT FIRST ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION BY ANOTHER FIGURE PARTING FROM IT WITH A KISS AND AS IT GLIDED CALMLY AWAY THROUGH THE DISORDER REMINDING ME OFAGNES BUT IN THE RAPID MOTION AND CONFUSION AND IN THE UNSETTLEMENT OF MY OWN THOUGHTS I LOST IT AGAIN AND ONLY KNEW THAT THE TIME WAS COME WHEN ALL VISITORS WERE BEING WARNED TO LEAVE THE SHIP THAT MY NURSE WAS CRYING ON A CHEST BESIDE ME AND THAT MRS GUMMIDGE ASSISTED BY SOME YOUNGER STOOPING WOMAN IN BLACK WAS BUSILY ARRANGING MR PEGGOTTYS GOODS IS THERE ANY LAST WURED MASR DAVY SAID HE IS THERE ANY ONE FORGOTTEN THING AFORE WE PARTS ONE THING SAID I MARTHA HE TOUCHED THE YOUNGER WOMAN I HAVE MENTIONED ON THE SHOULDER AND MARTHA STOOD BEFORE ME HEAVEN BLESS YOU YOU GOOD MAN CRIED I YOU TAKE HER WITH YOU SHE ANSWERED FOR HIM WITH A BURST OF TEARS I COULD SPEAK NO MORE AT THAT TIME BUT I WRUNG HIS HAND AND IF EVER I HAVE LOVED AND HONOURED ANY MAN I LOVED AND HONOURED THAT MAN IN MY SOUL THE SHIP WAS CLEARING FAST OF STRANGERS THE GREATEST TRIAL THAT I HAD REMAINED I TOLD HIM WHAT THE NOBLE SPIRIT THAT WAS GONE HAD GIVEN ME IN CHARGE TO SAY AT PARTING IT MOVED HIM DEEPLY BUT WHEN HE CHARGED ME IN RETURN WITH MANY MESSAGES OF AFFECTION AND REGRET FOR THOSE DEAF EARS HE MOVED ME MORE THE TIME WAS COME I EMBRACED HIM TOOK MY WEEPING NURSE UPON MY ARM AND HURRIED AWAY ON DECK I TOOK LEAVE OF POOR MRS MICAWBER SHE WAS LOOKING DISTRACTEDLY ABOUT FOR HER FAMILY EVEN THEN AND HER LAST WORDS TO ME WERE THAT SHE NEVER WOULD DESERT MR MICAWBER WE WENT OVER THE SIDE INTO OUR BOAT AND LAY AT A LITTLE DISTANCE TO SEE THE SHIP WAFTED ON HER COURSE IT WAS THEN CALM RADIANT SUNSET SHE LAY BETWEEN US AND THE RED LIGHT AND EVERY TAPER LINE AND SPAR WAS VISIBLE AGAINST THE GLOW A SIGHT AT ONCE SO BEAUTIFUL SO MOURNFUL AND SO HOPEFUL AS THE GLORIOUS SHIP LYING STILL ON THE FLUSHED WATER WITH ALL THE LIFE ON BOARD HER CROWDED AT THE BULWARKS AND THERE CLUSTERING FOR A MOMENT BAREHEADED AND SILENT I NEVER SAW SILENT ONLY FOR A MOMENT AS THE SAILS ROSE TO THE WIND AND THE SHIP BEGAN TO MOVE THERE BROKE FROM ALL THE BOATS THREE RESOUNDING CHEERS WHICH THOSE ON BOARD TOOK UP AND ECHOED BACK AND WHICH WERE ECHOED AND REECHOED MY HEART BURST OUT WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND AND BEHELD THE WAVING OF THE HATS AND HANDKERCHIEFSAND THEN I SAW HER THEN I SAW HER AT HER UNCLES SIDE AND TREMBLING ON HIS SHOULDER HE POINTED TO US WITH AN EAGER HAND AND SHE SAW US AND WAVED HER LAST GOODBYE TO ME AYE EMILY BEAUTIFUL AND DROOPING CLING TO HIM WITH THE UTMOST TRUST OF THY BRUISED HEART FOR HE HAS CLUNG TO THEE WITH ALL THE MIGHT OF HIS GREAT LOVE SURROUNDED BY THE ROSY LIGHT AND STANDING HIGH UPON THE DECK APART TOGETHER SHE CLINGING TO HIM AND HE HOLDING HER THEY SOLEMNLY PASSED AWAY THE NIGHT HAD FALLEN ON THE KENTISH HILLS WHEN WE WERE ROWED ASHOREAND FALLEN DARKLY UPON ME CHAPTER ABSENCE IT WAS A LONG AND GLOOMY NIGHT THAT GATHERED ON ME HAUNTED BY THE GHOSTS OF MANY HOPES OF MANY DEAR REMEMBRANCES MANY ERRORS MANY UNAVAILING SORROWS AND REGRETS I WENT AWAY FROM ENGLAND NOT KNOWING EVEN THEN HOW GREAT THE SHOCK WAS THAT I HAD TO BEAR I LEFT ALL WHO WERE DEAR TO ME AND WENT AWAY AND BELIEVED THAT I HAD BORNE IT AND IT WAS PAST AS A MAN UPON A FIELD OF BATTLE WILL RECEIVE A MORTAL HURT AND SCARCELY KNOW THAT HE IS STRUCK SO I WHEN I WAS LEFT ALONE WITH MY UNDISCIPLINED HEART HAD NO CONCEPTION OF THE WOUND WITH WHICH IT HAD TO STRIVE THE KNOWLEDGE CAME UPON ME NOT QUICKLY BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE AND GRAIN BY GRAIN THE DESOLATE FEELING WITH WHICH I WENT ABROAD DEEPENED AND WIDENED HOURLY AT FIRST IT WAS A HEAVY SENSE OF LOSS AND SORROW WHEREIN I COULD DISTINGUISH LITTLE ELSE BY IMPERCEPTIBLE DEGREES IT BECAME A HOPELESS CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THAT I HAD LOSTLOVE FRIENDSHIP INTEREST OF ALL THAT HAD BEEN SHATTEREDMY FIRST TRUST MY FIRST AFFECTION THE WHOLE AIRY CASTLE OF MY LIFE OF ALL THAT REMAINEDA RUINED BLANK AND WASTE LYING WIDE AROUND ME UNBROKEN TO THE DARK HORIZON IF MY GRIEF WERE SELFISH I DID NOT KNOW IT TO BE SO I MOURNED FOR MY CHILDWIFE TAKEN FROM HER BLOOMING WORLD SO YOUNG I MOURNED FOR HIM WHO MIGHT HAVE WON THE LOVE AND ADMIRATION OF THOUSANDS AS HE HAD WON MINE LONG AGO I MOURNED FOR THE BROKEN HEART THAT HAD FOUND REST IN THE STORMY SEA AND FOR THE WANDERING REMNANTS OF THE SIMPLE HOME WHERE I HAD HEARD THE NIGHTWIND BLOWING WHEN I WAS A CHILD FROM THE ACCUMULATED SADNESS INTO WHICH I FELL I HAD AT LENGTH NO HOPE OF EVER ISSUING AGAIN I ROAMED FROM PLACE TO PLACE CARRYING MY BURDEN WITH ME EVERYWHERE I FELT ITS WHOLE WEIGHT NOW AND I DROOPED BENEATH IT AND I SAID IN MY HEART THAT IT COULD NEVER BE LIGHTENED WHEN THIS DESPONDENCY WAS AT ITS WORST I BELIEVED THAT I SHOULD DIE SOMETIMES I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DIE AT HOME AND ACTUALLY TURNED BACK ON MY ROAD THAT I MIGHT GET THERE SOON AT OTHER TIMES I PASSED ON FARTHER AWAYFROM CITY TO CITY SEEKING I KNOW NOT WHAT AND TRYING TO LEAVE I KNOW NOT WHAT BEHIND IT IS NOT IN MY POWER TO RETRACE ONE BY ONE ALL THE WEARY PHASES OF DISTRESS OF MIND THROUGH WHICH I PASSED THERE ARE SOME DREAMS THAT CAN ONLY BE IMPERFECTLY AND VAGUELY DESCRIBED AND WHEN I OBLIGE MYSELF TO LOOK BACK ON THIS TIME OF MY LIFE I SEEM TO BE RECALLING SUCH A DREAM I SEE MYSELF PASSING ON AMONG THE NOVELTIES OF FOREIGN TOWNS PALACES CATHEDRALS TEMPLES PICTURES CASTLES TOMBS FANTASTIC STREETSTHE OLD ABIDING PLACES OF HISTORY AND FANCYAS A DREAMER MIGHT BEARING MY PAINFUL LOAD THROUGH ALL AND HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF THE OBJECTS AS THEY FADE BEFORE ME LISTLESSNESS TO EVERYTHING BUT BROODING SORROW WAS THE NIGHT THAT FELL ON MY UNDISCIPLINED HEART LET ME LOOK UP FROM ITAS AT LAST I DID THANK HEAVENAND FROM ITS LONG SAD WRETCHED DREAM TO DAWN FOR MANY MONTHS I TRAVELLED WITH THIS EVERDARKENING CLOUD UPON MY MIND SOME BLIND REASONS THAT I HAD FOR NOT RETURNING HOMEREASONS THEN STRUGGLING WITHIN ME VAINLY FOR MORE DISTINCT EXPRESSIONKEPT ME ON MY PILGRIMAGE SOMETIMES I HAD PROCEEDED RESTLESSLY FROM PLACE TO PLACE STOPPING NOWHERE SOMETIMES I HAD LINGERED LONG IN ONE SPOT I HAD HAD NO PURPOSE NO SUSTAINING SOUL WITHIN ME ANYWHERE I WAS IN SWITZERLAND I HAD COME OUT OF ITALY OVER ONE OF THE GREAT PASSES OF THE ALPS AND HAD SINCE WANDERED WITH A GUIDE AMONG THE BYWAYS OF THE MOUNTAINS IF THOSE AWFUL SOLITUDES HAD SPOKEN TO MY HEART I DID NOT KNOW IT I HAD FOUND SUBLIMITY AND WONDER IN THE DREAD HEIGHTS AND PRECIPICES IN THE ROARING TORRENTS AND THE WASTES OF ICE AND SNOW BUT AS YET THEY HAD TAUGHT ME NOTHING ELSE I CAME ONE EVENING BEFORE SUNSET DOWN INTO A VALLEY WHERE I WAS TO REST IN THE COURSE OF MY DESCENT TO IT BY THE WINDING TRACK ALONG THE MOUNTAINSIDE FROM WHICH I SAW IT SHINING FAR BELOW I THINK SOME LONGUNWONTED SENSE OF BEAUTY AND TRANQUILLITY SOME SOFTENING INFLUENCE AWAKENED BY ITS PEACE MOVED FAINTLY IN MY BREAST I REMEMBER PAUSING ONCE WITH A KIND OF SORROW THAT WAS NOT ALL OPPRESSIVE NOT QUITE DESPAIRING I REMEMBER ALMOST HOPING THAT SOME BETTER CHANGE WAS POSSIBLE WITHIN ME I CAME INTO THE VALLEY AS THE EVENING SUN WAS SHINING ON THE REMOTE HEIGHTS OF SNOW THAT CLOSED IT IN LIKE ETERNAL CLOUDS THE BASES OF THE MOUNTAINS FORMING THE GORGE IN WHICH THE LITTLE VILLAGE LAY WERE RICHLY GREEN AND HIGH ABOVE THIS GENTLER VEGETATION GREW FORESTS OF DARK FIR CLEAVING THE WINTRY SNOWDRIFT WEDGELIKE AND STEMMING THE AVALANCHE ABOVE THESE WERE RANGE UPON RANGE OF CRAGGY STEEPS GREY ROCK BRIGHT ICE AND SMOOTH VERDURESPECKS OF PASTURE ALL GRADUALLY BLENDING WITH THE CROWNING SNOW DOTTED HERE AND THERE ON THE MOUNTAINSSIDE EACH TINY DOT A HOME WERE LONELY WOODEN COTTAGES SO DWARFED BY THE TOWERING HEIGHTS THAT THEY APPEARED TOO SMALL FOR TOYS SO DID EVEN THE CLUSTERED VILLAGE IN THE VALLEY WITH ITS WOODEN BRIDGE ACROSS THE STREAM WHERE THE STREAM TUMBLED OVER BROKEN ROCKS AND ROARED AWAY AMONG THE TREES IN THE QUIET AIR THERE WAS A SOUND OF DISTANT SINGINGSHEPHERD VOICES BUT AS ONE BRIGHT EVENING CLOUD FLOATED MIDWAY ALONG THE MOUNTAINSSIDE I COULD ALMOST HAVE BELIEVED IT CAME FROM THERE AND WAS NOT EARTHLY MUSIC ALL AT ONCE IN THIS SERENITY GREAT NATURE SPOKE TO ME AND SOOTHED ME TO LAY DOWN MY WEARY HEAD UPON THE GRASS AND WEEP AS I HAD NOT WEPT YET SINCE DORA DIED I HAD FOUND A PACKET OF LETTERS AWAITING ME BUT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE AND HAD STROLLED OUT OF THE VILLAGE TO READ THEM WHILE MY SUPPER WAS MAKING READY OTHER PACKETS HAD MISSED ME AND I HAD RECEIVED NONE FOR A LONG TIME BEYOND A LINE OR TWO TO SAY THAT I WAS WELL AND HAD ARRIVED AT SUCH A PLACE I HAD NOT HAD FORTITUDE OR CONSTANCY TO WRITE A LETTER SINCE I LEFT HOME THE PACKET WAS IN MY HAND I OPENED IT AND READ THE WRITING OF AGNES SHE WAS HAPPY AND USEFUL WAS PROSPERING AS SHE HAD HOPED THAT WAS ALL SHE TOLD ME OF HERSELF THE REST REFERRED TO ME SHE GAVE ME NO ADVICE SHE URGED NO DUTY ON ME SHE ONLY TOLD ME IN HER OWN FERVENT MANNER WHAT HER TRUST IN ME WAS SHE KNEW SHE SAID HOW SUCH A NATURE AS MINE WOULD TURN AFFLICTION TO GOOD SHE KNEW HOW TRIAL AND EMOTION WOULD EXALT AND STRENGTHEN IT SHE WAS SURE THAT IN MY EVERY PURPOSE I SHOULD GAIN A FIRMER AND A HIGHER TENDENCY THROUGH THE GRIEF I HAD UNDERGONE SHE WHO SO GLORIED IN MY FAME AND SO LOOKED FORWARD TO ITS AUGMENTATION WELL KNEW THAT I WOULD LABOUR ON SHE KNEW THAT IN ME SORROW COULD NOT BE WEAKNESS BUT MUST BE STRENGTH AS THE ENDURANCE OF MY CHILDISH DAYS HAD DONE ITS PART TO MAKE ME WHAT I WAS SO GREATER CALAMITIES WOULD NERVE ME ON TO BE YET BETTER THAN I WAS AND SO AS THEY HAD TAUGHT ME WOULD I TEACH OTHERS SHE COMMENDED ME TO GOD WHO HAD TAKEN MY INNOCENT DARLING TO HIS REST AND IN HER SISTERLY AFFECTION CHERISHED ME ALWAYS AND WAS ALWAYS AT MY SIDE GO WHERE I WOULD PROUD OF WHAT I HAD DONE BUT INFINITELY PROUDER YET OF WHAT I WAS RESERVED TO DO I PUT THE LETTER IN MY BREAST AND THOUGHT WHAT HAD I BEEN AN HOUR AGO WHEN I HEARD THE VOICES DIE AWAY AND SAW THE QUIET EVENING CLOUD GROW DIM AND ALL THE COLOURS IN THE VALLEY FADE AND THE GOLDEN SNOW UPON THE MOUNTAINTOPS BECOME A REMOTE PART OF THE PALE NIGHT SKY YET FELT THAT THE NIGHT WAS PASSING FROM MY MIND AND ALL ITS SHADOWS CLEARING THERE WAS NO NAME FOR THE LOVE I BORE HER DEARER TO ME HENCEFORWARD THAN EVER UNTIL THEN I READ HER LETTER MANY TIMES I WROTE TO HER BEFORE I SLEPT I TOLD HER THAT I HAD BEEN IN SORE NEED OF HER HELP THAT WITHOUT HER I WAS NOT AND I NEVER HAD BEEN WHAT SHE THOUGHT ME BUT THAT SHE INSPIRED ME TO BE THAT AND I WOULD TRY I DID TRY IN THREE MONTHS MORE A YEAR WOULD HAVE PASSED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MY SORROW I DETERMINED TO MAKE NO RESOLUTIONS UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THOSE THREE MONTHS BUT TO TRY I LIVED IN THAT VALLEY AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD ALL THE TIME THE THREE MONTHS GONE I RESOLVED TO REMAIN AWAY FROM HOME FOR SOME TIME LONGER TO SETTLE MYSELF FOR THE PRESENT IN SWITZERLAND WHICH WAS GROWING DEAR TO ME IN THE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT EVENING TO RESUME MY PEN TO WORK I RESORTED HUMBLY WHITHER AGNES HAD COMMENDED ME I SOUGHT OUT NATURE NEVER SOUGHT IN VAIN AND I ADMITTED TO MY BREAST THE HUMAN INTEREST I HAD LATELY SHRUNK FROM IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE I HAD ALMOST AS MANY FRIENDS IN THE VALLEY AS IN YARMOUTH AND WHEN I LEFT IT BEFORE THE WINTER SET IN FOR GENEVA AND CAME BACK IN THE SPRING THEIR CORDIAL GREETINGS HAD A HOMELY SOUND TO ME ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT CONVEYED IN ENGLISH WORDS I WORKED EARLY AND LATE PATIENTLY AND HARD I WROTE A STORY WITH A PURPOSE GROWING NOT REMOTELY OUT OF MY EXPERIENCE AND SENT IT TO TRADDLES AND HE ARRANGED FOR ITS PUBLICATION VERY ADVANTAGEOUSLY FOR ME AND THE TIDINGS OF MY GROWING REPUTATION BEGAN TO REACH ME FROM TRAVELLERS WHOM I ENCOUNTERED BY CHANCE AFTER SOME REST AND CHANGE I FELL TO WORK IN MY OLD ARDENT WAY ON A NEW FANCY WHICH TOOK STRONG POSSESSION OF ME AS I ADVANCED IN THE EXECUTION OF THIS TASK I FELT IT MORE AND MORE AND ROUSED MY UTMOST ENERGIES TO DO IT WELL THIS WAS MY THIRD WORK OF FICTION IT WAS NOT HALF WRITTEN WHEN IN AN INTERVAL OF REST I THOUGHT OF RETURNING HOME FOR A LONG TIME THOUGH STUDYING AND WORKING PATIENTLY I HAD ACCUSTOMED MYSELF TO ROBUST EXERCISE MY HEALTH SEVERELY IMPAIRED WHEN I LEFT ENGLAND WAS QUITE RESTORED I HAD SEEN MUCH I HAD BEEN IN MANY COUNTRIES AND I HOPE I HAD IMPROVED MY STORE OF KNOWLEDGE I HAVE NOW RECALLED ALL THAT I THINK IT NEEDFUL TO RECALL HERE OF THIS TERM OF ABSENCEWITH ONE RESERVATION I HAVE MADE IT THUS FAR WITH NO PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING ANY OF MY THOUGHTS FOR AS I HAVE ELSEWHERE SAID THIS NARRATIVE IS MY WRITTEN MEMORY I HAVE DESIRED TO KEEP THE MOST SECRET CURRENT OF MY MIND APART AND TO THE LAST I ENTER ON IT NOW I CANNOT SO COMPLETELY PENETRATE THE MYSTERY OF MY OWN HEART AS TO KNOW WHEN I BEGAN TO THINK THAT I MIGHT HAVE SET ITS EARLIEST AND BRIGHTEST HOPES ON AGNES I CANNOT SAY AT WHAT STAGE OF MY GRIEF IT FIRST BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH THE REFLECTION THAT IN MY WAYWARD BOYHOOD I HAD THROWN AWAY THE TREASURE OF HER LOVE I BELIEVE I MAY HAVE HEARD SOME WHISPER OF THAT DISTANT THOUGHT IN THE OLD UNHAPPY LOSS OR WANT OF SOMETHING NEVER TO BE REALIZED OF WHICH I HAD BEEN SENSIBLE BUT THE THOUGHT CAME INTO MY MIND AS A NEW REPROACH AND NEW REGRET WHEN I WAS LEFT SO SAD AND LONELY IN THE WORLD IF AT THAT TIME I HAD BEEN MUCH WITH HER I SHOULD IN THE WEAKNESS OF MY DESOLATION HAVE BETRAYED THIS IT WAS WHAT I REMOTELY DREADED WHEN I WAS FIRST IMPELLED TO STAY AWAY FROM ENGLAND I COULD NOT HAVE BORNE TO LOSE THE SMALLEST PORTION OF HER SISTERLY AFFECTION YET IN THAT BETRAYAL I SHOULD HAVE SET A CONSTRAINT BETWEEN US HITHERTO UNKNOWN I COULD NOT FORGET THAT THE FEELING WITH WHICH SHE NOW REGARDED ME HAD GROWN UP IN MY OWN FREE CHOICE AND COURSE THAT IF SHE HAD EVER LOVED ME WITH ANOTHER LOVEAND I SOMETIMES THOUGHT THE TIME WAS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE SOI HAD CAST IT AWAY IT WAS NOTHING NOW THAT I HAD ACCUSTOMED MYSELF TO THINK OF HER WHEN WE WERE BOTH MERE CHILDREN AS ONE WHO WAS FAR REMOVED FROM MY WILD FANCIES I HAD BESTOWED MY PASSIONATE TENDERNESS UPON ANOTHER OBJECT AND WHAT I MIGHT HAVE DONE I HAD NOT DONE AND WHAT AGNES WAS TO ME I AND HER OWN NOBLE HEART HAD MADE HER IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CHANGE THAT GRADUALLY WORKED IN ME WHEN I TRIED TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF MYSELF AND BE A BETTER MAN I DID GLANCE THROUGH SOME INDEFINITE PROBATION TO A PERIOD WHEN I MIGHT POSSIBLY HOPE TO CANCEL THE MISTAKEN PAST AND TO BE SO BLESSED AS TO MARRY HER BUT AS TIME WORE ON THIS SHADOWY PROSPECT FADED AND DEPARTED FROM ME IF SHE HAD EVER LOVED ME THEN I SHOULD HOLD HER THE MORE SACRED REMEMBERING THE CONFIDENCES I HAD REPOSED IN HER HER KNOWLEDGE OF MY ERRANT HEART THE SACRIFICE SHE MUST HAVE MADE TO BE MY FRIEND AND SISTER AND THE VICTORY SHE HAD WON IF SHE HAD NEVER LOVED ME COULD I BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD LOVE ME NOW I HAD ALWAYS FELT MY WEAKNESS IN COMPARISON WITH HER CONSTANCY AND FORTITUDE AND NOW I FELT IT MORE AND MORE WHATEVER I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO HER OR SHE TO ME IF I HAD BEEN MORE WORTHY OF HER LONG AGO I WAS NOT NOW AND SHE WAS NOT THE TIME WAS PAST I HAD LET IT GO BY AND HAD DESERVEDLY LOST HER THAT I SUFFERED MUCH IN THESE CONTENTIONS THAT THEY FILLED ME WITH UNHAPPINESS AND REMORSE AND YET THAT I HAD A SUSTAINING SENSE THAT IT WAS REQUIRED OF ME IN RIGHT AND HONOUR TO KEEP AWAY FROM MYSELF WITH SHAME THE THOUGHT OF TURNING TO THE DEAR GIRL IN THE WITHERING OF MY HOPES FROM WHOM I HAD FRIVOLOUSLY TURNED WHEN THEY WERE BRIGHT AND FRESHWHICH CONSIDERATION WAS AT THE ROOT OF EVERY THOUGHT I HAD CONCERNING HERIS ALL EQUALLY TRUE I MADE NO EFFORT TO CONCEAL FROM MYSELF NOW THAT I LOVED HER THAT I WAS DEVOTED TO HER BUT I BROUGHT THE ASSURANCE HOME TO MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOW TOO LATE AND THAT OUR LONGSUBSISTING RELATION MUST BE UNDISTURBED I HAD THOUGHT MUCH AND OFTEN OF MY DORAS SHADOWING OUT TO ME WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IN THOSE YEARS THAT WERE DESTINED NOT TO TRY US I HAD CONSIDERED HOW THE THINGS THAT NEVER HAPPEN ARE OFTEN AS MUCH REALITIES TO US IN THEIR EFFECTS AS THOSE THAT ARE ACCOMPLISHED THE VERY YEARS SHE SPOKE OF WERE REALITIES NOW FOR MY CORRECTION AND WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE DAY A LITTLE LATER PERHAPS THOUGH WE HAD PARTED IN OUR EARLIEST FOLLY I ENDEAVOURED TO CONVERT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETWEEN MYSELF AND AGNES INTO A MEANS OF MAKING ME MORE SELFDENYING MORE RESOLVED MORE CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF AND MY DEFECTS AND ERRORS THUS THROUGH THE REFLECTION THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN I ARRIVED AT THE CONVICTION THAT IT COULD NEVER BE THESE WITH THEIR PERPLEXITIES AND INCONSISTENCIES WERE THE SHIFTING QUICKSANDS OF MY MIND FROM THE TIME OF MY DEPARTURE TO THE TIME OF MY RETURN HOME THREE YEARS AFTERWARDS THREE YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE SAILING OF THE EMIGRANT SHIP WHEN AT THAT SAME HOUR OF SUNSET AND IN THE SAME PLACE I STOOD ON THE DECK OF THE PACKET VESSEL THAT BROUGHT ME HOME LOOKING ON THE ROSY WATER WHERE I HAD SEEN THE IMAGE OF THAT SHIP REFLECTED THREE YEARS LONG IN THE AGGREGATE THOUGH SHORT AS THEY WENT BY AND HOME WAS VERY DEAR TO ME AND AGNES TOOBUT SHE WAS NOT MINESHE WAS NEVER TO BE MINE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT THAT WAS PAST CHAPTER RETURN I LANDED IN LONDON ON A WINTRY AUTUMN EVENING IT WAS DARK AND RAINING AND I SAW MORE FOG AND MUD IN A MINUTE THAN I HAD SEEN IN A YEAR I WALKED FROM THE CUSTOM HOUSE TO THE MONUMENT BEFORE I FOUND A COACH AND ALTHOUGH THE VERY HOUSEFRONTS LOOKING ON THE SWOLLEN GUTTERS WERE LIKE OLD FRIENDS TO ME I COULD NOT BUT ADMIT THAT THEY WERE VERY DINGY FRIENDS I HAVE OFTEN REMARKEDI SUPPOSE EVERYBODY HASTHAT ONES GOING AWAY FROM A FAMILIAR PLACE WOULD SEEM TO BE THE SIGNAL FOR CHANGE IN IT AS I LOOKED OUT OF THE COACH WINDOW AND OBSERVED THAT AN OLD HOUSE ON FISHSTREET HILL WHICH HAD STOOD UNTOUCHED BY PAINTER CARPENTER OR BRICKLAYER FOR A CENTURY HAD BEEN PULLED DOWN IN MY ABSENCE AND THAT A NEIGHBOURING STREET OF TIMEHONOURED INSALUBRITY AND INCONVENIENCE WAS BEING DRAINED AND WIDENED I HALF EXPECTED TO FIND ST PAULS CATHEDRAL LOOKING OLDER FOR SOME CHANGES IN THE FORTUNES OF MY FRIENDS I WAS PREPARED MY AUNT HAD LONG BEEN REESTABLISHED AT DOVER AND TRADDLES HAD BEGUN TO GET INTO SOME LITTLE PRACTICE AT THE BAR IN THE VERY FIRST TERM AFTER MY DEPARTURE HE HAD CHAMBERS IN GRAYS INN NOW AND HAD TOLD ME IN HIS LAST LETTERS THAT HE WAS NOT WITHOUT HOPES OF BEING SOON UNITED TO THE DEAREST GIRL IN THE WORLD THEY EXPECTED ME HOME BEFORE CHRISTMAS BUT HAD NO IDEA OF MY RETURNING SO SOON I HAD PURPOSELY MISLED THEM THAT I MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF TAKING THEM BY SURPRISE AND YET I WAS PERVERSE ENOUGH TO FEEL A CHILL AND DISAPPOINTMENT IN RECEIVING NO WELCOME AND RATTLING ALONE AND SILENT THROUGH THE MISTY STREETS THE WELLKNOWN SHOPS HOWEVER WITH THEIR CHEERFUL LIGHTS DID SOMETHING FOR ME AND WHEN I ALIGHTED AT THE DOOR OF THE GRAYS INN COFFEEHOUSE I HAD RECOVERED MY SPIRITS IT RECALLED AT FIRST THAT SODIFFERENT TIME WHEN I HAD PUT UP AT THE GOLDEN CROSS AND REMINDED ME OF THE CHANGES THAT HAD COME TO PASS SINCE THEN BUT THAT WAS NATURAL DO YOU KNOW WHERE MR TRADDLES LIVES IN THE INN I ASKED THE WAITER AS I WARMED MYSELF BY THE COFFEEROOM FIRE HOLBORN COURT SIR NUMBER TWO MR TRADDLES HAS A RISING REPUTATION AMONG THE LAWYERS I BELIEVE SAID I WELL SIR RETURNED THE WAITER PROBABLY HE HAS SIR BUT I AM NOT AWARE OF IT MYSELF THIS WAITER WHO WAS MIDDLEAGED AND SPARE LOOKED FOR HELP TO A WAITER OF MORE AUTHORITYA STOUT POTENTIAL OLD MAN WITH A DOUBLE CHIN IN BLACK BREECHES AND STOCKINGS WHO CAME OUT OF A PLACE LIKE A CHURCHWARDENS PEW AT THE END OF THE COFFEEROOM WHERE HE KEPT COMPANY WITH A CASHBOX A DIRECTORY A LAWLIST AND OTHER BOOKS AND PAPERS MR TRADDLES SAID THE SPARE WAITER NUMBER TWO IN THE COURT THE POTENTIAL WAITER WAVED HIM AWAY AND TURNED GRAVELY TO ME I WAS INQUIRING SAID I WHETHER MR TRADDLES AT NUMBER TWO IN THE COURT HAS NOT A RISING REPUTATION AMONG THE LAWYERS NEVER HEARD HIS NAME SAID THE WAITER IN A RICH HUSKY VOICE I FELT QUITE APOLOGETIC FOR TRADDLES HES A YOUNG MAN SURE SAID THE PORTENTOUS WAITER FIXING HIS EYES SEVERELY ON ME HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN IN THE INN NOT ABOVE THREE YEARS SAID I THE WAITER WHO I SUPPOSED HAD LIVED IN HIS CHURCHWARDENS PEW FOR FORTY YEARS COULD NOT PURSUE SUCH AN INSIGNIFICANT SUBJECT HE ASKED ME WHAT I WOULD HAVE FOR DINNER I FELT I WAS IN ENGLAND AGAIN AND REALLY WAS QUITE CAST DOWN ON TRADDLESS ACCOUNT THERE SEEMED TO BE NO HOPE FOR HIM I MEEKLY ORDERED A BIT OF FISH AND A STEAK AND STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE MUSING ON HIS OBSCURITY AS I FOLLOWED THE CHIEF WAITER WITH MY EYES I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT THE GARDEN IN WHICH HE HAD GRADUALLY BLOWN TO BE THE FLOWER HE WAS WAS AN ARDUOUS PLACE TO RISE IN IT HAD SUCH A PRESCRIPTIVE STIFFNECKED LONGESTABLISHED SOLEMN ELDERLY AIR I GLANCED ABOUT THE ROOM WHICH HAD HAD ITS SANDED FLOOR SANDED NO DOUBT IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER WHEN THE CHIEF WAITER WAS A BOYIF HE EVER WAS A BOY WHICH APPEARED IMPROBABLE AND AT THE SHINING TABLES WHERE I SAW MYSELF REFLECTED IN UNRUFFLED DEPTHS OF OLD MAHOGANY AND AT THE LAMPS WITHOUT A FLAW IN THEIR TRIMMING OR CLEANING AND AT THE COMFORTABLE GREEN CURTAINS WITH THEIR PURE BRASS RODS SNUGLY ENCLOSING THE BOXES AND AT THE TWO LARGE COAL FIRES BRIGHTLY BURNING AND AT THE ROWS OF DECANTERS BURLY AS IF WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF PIPES OF EXPENSIVE OLD PORT WINE BELOW AND BOTH ENGLAND AND THE LAW APPEARED TO ME TO BE VERY DIFFICULT INDEED TO BE TAKEN BY STORM I WENT UP TO MY BEDROOM TO CHANGE MY WET CLOTHES AND THE VAST EXTENT OF THAT OLD WAINSCOTED APARTMENT WHICH WAS OVER THE ARCHWAY LEADING TO THE INN I REMEMBER AND THE SEDATE IMMENSITY OF THE FOURPOST BEDSTEAD AND THE INDOMITABLE GRAVITY OF THE CHESTS OF DRAWERS ALL SEEMED TO UNITE IN STERNLY FROWNING ON THE FORTUNES OF TRADDLES OR ON ANY SUCH DARING YOUTH I CAME DOWN AGAIN TO MY DINNER AND EVEN THE SLOW COMFORT OF THE MEAL AND THE ORDERLY SILENCE OF THE PLACEWHICH WAS BARE OF GUESTS THE LONG VACATION NOT YET BEING OVERWERE ELOQUENT ON THE AUDACITY OF TRADDLES AND HIS SMALL HOPES OF A LIVELIHOOD FOR TWENTY YEARS TO COME I HAD SEEN NOTHING LIKE THIS SINCE I WENT AWAY AND IT QUITE DASHED MY HOPES FOR MY FRIEND THE CHIEF WAITER HAD HAD ENOUGH OF ME HE CAME NEAR ME NO MORE BUT DEVOTED HIMSELF TO AN OLD GENTLEMAN IN LONG GAITERS TO MEET WHOM A PINT OF SPECIAL PORT SEEMED TO COME OUT OF THE CELLAR OF ITS OWN ACCORD FOR HE GAVE NO ORDER THE SECOND WAITER INFORMED ME IN A WHISPER THAT THIS OLD GENTLEMAN WAS A RETIRED CONVEYANCER LIVING IN THE SQUARE AND WORTH A MINT OF MONEY WHICH IT WAS EXPECTED HE WOULD LEAVE TO HIS LAUNDRESSS DAUGHTER LIKEWISE THAT IT WAS RUMOURED THAT HE HAD A SERVICE OF PLATE IN A BUREAU ALL TARNISHED WITH LYING BY THOUGH MORE THAN ONE SPOON AND A FORK HAD NEVER YET BEEN BEHELD IN HIS CHAMBERS BY MORTAL VISION BY THIS TIME I QUITE GAVE TRADDLES UP FOR LOST AND SETTLED IN MY OWN MIND THAT THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR HIM BEING VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE THE DEAR OLD FELLOW NEVERTHELESS I DISPATCHED MY DINNER IN A MANNER NOT AT ALL CALCULATED TO RAISE ME IN THE OPINION OF THE CHIEF WAITER AND HURRIED OUT BY THE BACK WAY NUMBER TWO IN THE COURT WAS SOON REACHED AND AN INSCRIPTION ON THE DOORPOST INFORMING ME THAT MR TRADDLES OCCUPIED A SET OF CHAMBERS ON THE TOP STOREY I ASCENDED THE STAIRCASE A CRAZY OLD STAIRCASE I FOUND IT TO BE FEEBLY LIGHTED ON EACH LANDING BY A CLUBHEADED LITTLE OIL WICK DYING AWAY IN A LITTLE DUNGEON OF DIRTY GLASS IN THE COURSE OF MY STUMBLING UPSTAIRS I FANCIED I HEARD A PLEASANT SOUND OF LAUGHTER AND NOT THE LAUGHTER OF AN ATTORNEY OR BARRISTER OR ATTORNEYS CLERK OR BARRISTERS CLERK BUT OF TWO OR THREE MERRY GIRLS HAPPENING HOWEVER AS I STOPPED TO LISTEN TO PUT MY FOOT IN A HOLE WHERE THE HONOURABLE SOCIETY OF GRAYS INN HAD LEFT A PLANK DEFICIENT I FELL DOWN WITH SOME NOISE AND WHEN I RECOVERED MY FOOTING ALL WAS SILENT GROPING MY WAY MORE CAREFULLY FOR THE REST OF THE JOURNEY MY HEART BEAT HIGH WHEN I FOUND THE OUTER DOOR WHICH HAD MR TRADDLES PAINTED ON IT OPEN I KNOCKED A CONSIDERABLE SCUFFLING WITHIN ENSUED BUT NOTHING ELSE I THEREFORE KNOCKED AGAIN A SMALL SHARPLOOKING LAD HALFFOOTBOY AND HALFCLERK WHO WAS VERY MUCH OUT OF BREATH BUT WHO LOOKED AT ME AS IF HE DEFIED ME TO PROVE IT LEGALLY PRESENTED HIMSELF IS MR TRADDLES WITHIN I SAID YES SIR BUT HES ENGAGED I WANT TO SEE HIM AFTER A MOMENTS SURVEY OF ME THE SHARPLOOKING LAD DECIDED TO LET ME IN AND OPENING THE DOOR WIDER FOR THAT PURPOSE ADMITTED ME FIRST INTO A LITTLE CLOSET OF A HALL AND NEXT INTO A LITTLE SITTINGROOM WHERE I CAME INTO THE PRESENCE OF

EVERYTHING TOM WAS EVIDENTLY THE IDOL OF HER LIFE NEVER TO BE SHAKEN ON HIS PEDESTAL BY ANY COMMOTION ALWAYS TO BE BELIEVED IN AND DONE HOMAGE TO WITH THE WHOLE FAITH OF HER HEART COME WHAT MIGHT THE DEFERENCE WHICH BOTH SHE AND TRADDLES SHOWED TOWARDS THE BEAUTY PLEASED ME VERY MUCH I DONT KNOW THAT I THOUGHT IT VERY REASONABLE BUT I THOUGHT IT VERY DELIGHTFUL AND ESSENTIALLY A PART OF THEIR CHARACTER IF TRADDLES EVER FOR AN INSTANT MISSED THE TEASPOONS THAT WERE STILL TO BE WON I HAVE NO DOUBT IT WAS WHEN HE HANDED THE BEAUTY HER TEA IF HIS SWEETTEMPERED WIFE COULD HAVE GOT UP ANY SELFASSERTION AGAINST ANYONE I AM SATISFIED IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN BECAUSE SHE WAS THE BEAUTYS SISTER A FEW SLIGHT INDICATIONS OF A RATHER PETTED AND CAPRICIOUS MANNER WHICH I OBSERVED IN THE BEAUTY WERE MANIFESTLY CONSIDERED BY TRADDLES AND HIS WIFE AS HER BIRTHRIGHT AND NATURAL ENDOWMENT IF SHE HAD BEEN BORN A QUEEN BEE AND THEY LABOURING BEES THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE SATISFIED OF THAT BUT THEIR SELFFORGETFULNESS CHARMED ME THEIR PRIDE IN THESE GIRLS AND THEIR SUBMISSION OF THEMSELVES TO ALL THEIR WHIMS WAS THE PLEASANTEST LITTLE TESTIMONY TO THEIR OWN WORTH I COULD HAVE DESIRED TO SEE IF TRADDLES WERE ADDRESSED AS A DARLING ONCE IN THE COURSE OF THAT EVENING AND BESOUGHT TO BRING SOMETHING HERE OR CARRY SOMETHING THERE OR TAKE SOMETHING UP OR PUT SOMETHING DOWN OR FIND SOMETHING OR FETCH SOMETHING HE WAS SO ADDRESSED BY ONE OR OTHER OF HIS SISTERSINLAW AT LEAST TWELVE TIMES IN AN HOUR NEITHER COULD THEY DO ANYTHING WITHOUT SOPHY SOMEBODYS HAIR FELL DOWN AND NOBODY BUT SOPHY COULD PUT IT UP SOMEBODY FORGOT HOW A PARTICULAR TUNE WENT AND NOBODY BUT SOPHY COULD HUM THAT TUNE RIGHT SOMEBODY WANTED TO RECALL THE NAME OF A PLACE IN DEVONSHIRE AND ONLY SOPHY KNEW IT SOMETHING WAS WANTED TO BE WRITTEN HOME AND SOPHY ALONE COULD BE TRUSTED TO WRITE BEFORE BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING SOMEBODY BROKE DOWN IN A PIECE OF KNITTING AND NO ONE BUT SOPHY WAS ABLE TO PUT THE DEFAULTER IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THEY WERE ENTIRE MISTRESSES OF THE PLACE AND SOPHY AND TRADDLES WAITED ON THEM HOW MANY CHILDREN SOPHY COULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF IN HER TIME I CANT IMAGINE BUT SHE SEEMED TO BE FAMOUS FOR KNOWING EVERY SORT OF SONG THAT EVER WAS ADDRESSED TO A CHILD IN THE ENGLISH TONGUE AND SHE SANG DOZENS TO ORDER WITH THE CLEAREST LITTLE VOICE IN THE WORLD ONE AFTER ANOTHER EVERY SISTER ISSUING DIRECTIONS FOR A DIFFERENT TUNE AND THE BEAUTY GENERALLY STRIKING IN LAST SO THAT I WAS QUITE FASCINATED THE BEST OF ALL WAS THAT IN THE MIDST OF THEIR EXACTIONS ALL THE SISTERS HAD A GREAT TENDERNESS AND RESPECT BOTH FOR SOPHY AND TRADDLES I AM SURE WHEN I TOOK MY LEAVE AND TRADDLES WAS COMING OUT TO WALK WITH ME TO THE COFFEEHOUSE I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN AN OBSTINATE HEAD OF HAIR OR ANY OTHER HEAD OF HAIR ROLLING ABOUT IN SUCH A SHOWER OF KISSES ALTOGETHER IT WAS A SCENE I COULD NOT HELP DWELLING ON WITH PLEASURE FOR A LONG TIME AFTER I GOT BACK AND HAD WISHED TRADDLES GOOD NIGHT IF I HAD BEHELD A THOUSAND ROSES BLOWING IN A TOP SET OF CHAMBERS IN THAT WITHERED GRAYS INN THEY COULD NOT HAVE BRIGHTENED IT HALF SO MUCH THE IDEA OF THOSE DEVONSHIRE GIRLS AMONG THE DRY LAWSTATIONERS AND THE ATTORNEYS OFFICES AND OF THE TEA AND TOAST AND CHILDRENS SONGS IN THAT GRIM ATMOSPHERE OF POUNCE AND PARCHMENT REDTAPE DUSTY WAFERS INKJARS BRIEF AND DRAFT PAPER LAW REPORTS WRITS DECLARATIONS AND BILLS OF COSTS SEEMED ALMOST AS PLEASANTLY FANCIFUL AS IF I HAD DREAMED THAT THE SULTANS FAMOUS FAMILY HAD BEEN ADMITTED ON THE ROLL OF ATTORNEYS AND HAD BROUGHT THE TALKING BIRD THE SINGING TREE AND THE GOLDEN WATER INTO GRAYS INN HALL SOMEHOW I FOUND THAT I HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF TRADDLES FOR THE NIGHT AND COME BACK TO THE COFFEEHOUSE WITH A GREAT CHANGE IN MY DESPONDENCY ABOUT HIM I BEGAN TO THINK HE WOULD GET ON IN SPITE OF ALL THE MANY ORDERS OF CHIEF WAITERS IN ENGLAND DRAWING A CHAIR BEFORE ONE OF THE COFFEEROOM FIRES TO THINK ABOUT HIM AT MY LEISURE I GRADUALLY FELL FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF HIS HAPPINESS TO TRACING PROSPECTS IN THE LIVECOALS AND TO THINKING AS THEY BROKE AND CHANGED OF THE PRINCIPAL VICISSITUDES AND SEPARATIONS THAT HAD MARKED MY LIFE I HAD NOT SEEN A COAL FIRE SINCE I HAD LEFT ENGLAND THREE YEARS AGO THOUGH MANY A WOOD FIRE HAD I WATCHED AS IT CRUMBLED INTO HOARY ASHES AND MINGLED WITH THE FEATHERY HEAP UPON THE HEARTH WHICH NOT INAPTLY FIGURED TO ME IN MY DESPONDENCY MY OWN DEAD HOPES I COULD THINK OF THE PAST NOW GRAVELY BUT NOT BITTERLY AND COULD CONTEMPLATE THE FUTURE IN A BRAVE SPIRIT HOME IN ITS BEST SENSE WAS FOR ME NO MORE SHE IN WHOM I MIGHT HAVE INSPIRED A DEARER LOVE I HAD TAUGHT TO BE MY SISTER SHE WOULD MARRY AND WOULD HAVE NEW CLAIMANTS ON HER TENDERNESS AND IN DOING IT WOULD NEVER KNOW THE LOVE FOR HER THAT HAD GROWN UP IN MY HEART IT WAS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD PAY THE FORFEIT OF MY HEADLONG PASSION WHAT I REAPED I HAD SOWN I WAS THINKING AND HAD I TRULY DISCIPLINED MY HEART TO THIS AND COULD I RESOLUTELY BEAR

MY ACCOUNT OF MY MEETING WITH MR CHILLIP AND OF HIS HOLDING HER IN SUCH DREAD REMEMBRANCE AND BOTH SHE AND PEGGOTTY HAD A GREAT DEAL TO SAY ABOUT MY POOR MOTHERS SECOND HUSBAND AND THAT MURDERING

TALKED FAR INTO THE NIGHT HOW THE EMIGRANTS NEVER WROTE HOME OTHERWISE THAN CHEERFULLY AND HOPEFULLY HOW MR MICAWBER HAD ACTUALLY REMITTED DIVERS SMALL SUMS OF MONEY ON ACCOUNT OF THOSE PECUNIARY

WAS FREE AND HAPPY INSTEAD OF PINING IN MONOTONOUS RESTRAINT AND HOW AS A NOVEL GENERAL CONCLUSION NOBODY BUT SHE COULD EVER FULLY KNOW WHAT HE WAS AND WHEN TROT SAID MY AUNT PATTING THE BACK OF MY HAND AS WE SAT IN OUR OLD WAY BEFORE THE FIRE WHEN ARE YOU GOING OVER TO CANTERBURY I SHALL GET A HORSE AND RIDE OVER TOMORROW MORNING AUNT UNLESS YOU WILL GO WITH ME NO SAID MY AUNT IN HER SHORT

REVIVAL OF THOSE REGRETS WITH WHICH I HAD SO LONG BEEN OCCUPIED SOFTENED REGRETS THEY MIGHT BE TEACHING ME WHAT I HAD FAILED TO LEARN WHEN MY YOUNGER LIFE WAS ALL BEFORE ME BUT NOT THE LESS REGRETS OH

HAND ON MY SHOULDER AND SO WE BOTH SAT LOOKING INTO THE PAST WITHOUT SAYING ANOTHER WORD UNTIL WE PARTED FOR THE NIGHT I RODE AWAY EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR THE SCENE OF MY OLD SCHOOLDAYS I CANNOT SAY THAT I WAS YET QUITE HAPPY IN THE HOPE THAT I WAS GAINING A VICTORY OVER MYSELF EVEN IN THE PROSPECT OF SO SOON LOOKING ON HER FACE AGAIN THE WELLREMEMBERED GROUND WAS SOON TRAVERSED AND I CAME INTO THE QUIET STREETS WHERE EVERY STONE WAS A BOYS BOOK TO ME I WENT ON FOOT TO THE OLD HOUSE AND WENT AWAY WITH A HEART TOO FULL TO ENTER I RETURNED AND LOOKING AS I PASSED THROUGH THE LOW WINDOW OF THE TURRETROOM WHERE FIRST URIAH HEEP AND AFTERWARDS MR MICAWBER HAD BEEN WONT TO SIT SAW THAT IT WAS A LITTLE PARLOUR NOW AND THAT THERE WAS NO OFFICE OTHERWISE THE STAID OLD HOUSE WAS AS TO ITS CLEANLINESS AND ORDER STILL JUST AS IT HAD BEEN WHEN I FIRST SAW IT I REQUESTED THE NEW MAID WHO ADMITTED ME TO TELL MISS WICKFIELD THAT A GENTLEMAN WHO WAITED ON HER FROM A FRIEND ABROAD WAS THERE AND I WAS SHOWN UP THE GRAVE OLD STAIRCASE CAUTIONED OF THE STEPS I KNEW SO WELL INTO THE UNCHANGED DRAWINGROOM THE BOOKS THAT AGNES AND I HAD READ TOGETHER WERE ON THEIR SHELVES AND THE DESK WHERE I HAD LABOURED AT MY LESSONS MANY A NIGHT STOOD YET AT THE SAME OLD CORNER OF THE TABLE ALL THE LITTLE CHANGES THAT HAD CREPT IN WHEN THE HEEPS WERE THERE WERE CHANGED AGAIN EVERYTHING WAS AS IT USED TO BE IN THE HAPPY TIME I STOOD IN A WINDOW AND LOOKED ACROSS THE ANCIENT STREET AT THE OPPOSITE HOUSES RECALLING HOW I HAD WATCHED THEM ON WET AFTERNOONS WHEN I FIRST CAME THERE AND HOW I HAD USED TO SPECULATE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO APPEARED AT ANY OF THE WINDOWS AND HAD FOLLOWED THEM WITH MY EYES UP AND DOWN STAIRS WHILE WOMEN WENT CLICKING ALONG THE PAVEMENT IN PATTENS AND THE DULL RAIN FELL IN SLANTING LINES AND POURED OUT OF THE WATERSPOUT YONDER AND FLOWED INTO THE ROAD THE FEELING WITH WHICH I USED TO WATCH THE TRAMPS AS THEY CAME INTO THE TOWN ON THOSE WET EVENINGS AT DUSK AND LIMPED PAST WITH THEIR BUNDLES DROOPING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AT THE ENDS OF STICKS CAME FRESHLY BACK TO ME FRAUGHT AS THEN WITH THE SMELL OF DAMP EARTH AND WET LEAVES AND BRIAR AND THE SENSATION OF THE VERY AIRS THAT BLEW UPON ME IN MY OWN TOILSOME JOURNEY THE OPENING OF THE LITTLE DOOR IN THE PANELLED WALL MADE ME START AND TURN HER BEAUTIFUL SERENE EYES MET MINE AS SHE CAME TOWARDS ME SHE STOPPED AND

CROSSED HER FACE BUT EVEN IN THE START IT GAVE ME IT WAS GONE AND SHE WAS PLAYING ON AND LOOKING AT ME WITH HER OWN CALM SMILE AS I RODE BACK IN THE LONELY NIGHT THE WIND GOING BY ME LIKE A RESTLESS MEMORY I THOUGHT OF THIS AND FEARED SHE WAS NOT HAPPY I WAS NOT HAPPY BUT THUS FAR I HAD FAITHFULLY SET THE SEAL UPON THE PAST AND THINKING OF HER POINTING UPWARD THOUGHT OF HER AS POINTING TO THAT SKY ABOVE ME WHERE IN THE MYSTERY TO COME I MIGHT YET LOVE HER WITH A LOVE UNKNOWN ON EARTH AND TELL HER WHAT THE STRIFE HAD BEEN WITHIN ME WHEN I LOVED HER HERE CHAPTER I AM SHOWN TWO INTERESTING PENITENTS FOR A TIMEAT ALL EVENTS UNTIL MY BOOK SHOULD BE COMPLETED WHICH WOULD BE THE WORK OF SEVERAL MONTHSI TOOK UP MY ABODE IN MY AUNTS HOUSE AT DOVER AND THERE SITTING IN THE WINDOW FROM WHICH I HAD LOOKED OUT AT THE MOON UPON THE SEA WHEN THAT ROOF FIRST GAVE ME SHELTER I QUIETLY PURSUED MY TASK IN PURSUANCE OF MY INTENTION OF REFERRING TO MY OWN FICTIONS ONLY WHEN THEIR COURSE SHOULD INCIDENTALLY CONNECT ITSELF WITH THE PROGRESS OF MY STORY I DO NOT ENTER ON THE ASPIRATIONS THE DELIGHTS ANXIETIES AND TRIUMPHS OF MY ART THAT I TRULY DEVOTED MYSELF TO IT WITH MY STRONGEST EARNESTNESS AND BESTOWED UPON IT EVERY ENERGY OF MY SOUL I HAVE ALREADY SAID IF THE BOOKS I HAVE WRITTEN BE OF ANY WORTH THEY WILL SUPPLY THE REST I SHALL OTHERWISE HAVE WRITTEN TO POOR PURPOSE AND THE REST WILL BE OF INTEREST TO NO ONE OCCASIONALLY I WENT TO LONDON TO LOSE MYSELF IN THE SWARM OF LIFE THERE OR TO CONSULT WITH TRADDLES ON SOME BUSINESS POINT HE HAD MANAGED FOR ME IN MY ABSENCE WITH THE SOUNDEST JUDGEMENT AND MY WORLDLY AFFAIRS WERE PROSPERING AS MY NOTORIETY BEGAN TO BRING UPON ME AN ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF LETTERS FROM PEOPLE OF WHOM I HAD NO KNOWLEDGECHIEFLY ABOUT NOTHING AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ANSWERI AGREED WITH TRADDLES TO HAVE MY NAME PAINTED UP ON HIS DOOR THERE THE DEVOTED POSTMAN ON THAT BEAT DELIVERED BUSHELS OF LETTERS FOR ME AND THERE AT INTERVALS I LABOURED THROUGH THEM LIKE A HOME SECRETARY OF STATE WITHOUT THE SALARY AMONG THIS CORRESPONDENCE THERE DROPPED IN EVERY NOW AND THEN AN OBLIGING PROPOSAL FROM ONE OF THE NUMEROUS OUTSIDERS ALWAYS LURKING ABOUT THE COMMONS TO PRACTISE UNDER COVER OF MY NAME IF I WOULD TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS REMAINING TO MAKE A PROCTOR OF MYSELF AND PAY ME A PERCENTAGE ON THE PROFITS BUT I DECLINED THESE OFFERS BEING ALREADY AWARE THAT THERE WERE PLENTY OF SUCH COVERT PRACTITIONERS IN EXISTENCE AND CONSIDERING THE COMMONS QUITE BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT MY DOING ANYTHING TO MAKE IT WORSE THE GIRLS HAD GONE HOME WHEN MY NAME BURST INTO BLOOM ON TRADDLESS DOOR AND THE SHARP BOY LOOKED ALL DAY AS IF HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SOPHY SHUT UP IN A BACK ROOM GLANCING DOWN FROM HER WORK INTO A SOOTY LITTLE STRIP OF GARDEN WITH A PUMP IN IT BUT THERE I ALWAYS FOUND HER THE SAME BRIGHT HOUSEWIFE OFTEN HUMMING HER DEVONSHIRE BALLADS WHEN NO STRANGE FOOT WAS COMING UP THE STAIRS AND BLUNTING THE SHARP BOY IN HIS OFFICIAL CLOSET WITH MELODY I WONDERED AT FIRST WHY I SO OFTEN FOUND SOPHY WRITING IN A COPYBOOK AND WHY SHE ALWAYS SHUT IT UP WHEN I APPEARED AND HURRIED IT INTO THE TABLEDRAWER BUT THE SECRET SOON CAME OUT ONE DAY TRADDLES WHO HAD JUST COME HOME THROUGH THE DRIZZLING SLEET FROM COURT TOOK A PAPER OUT OF HIS DESK AND ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT OF THAT HANDWRITING OH DONT TOM CRIED SOPHY WHO WAS WARMING HIS SLIPPERS BEFORE THE FIRE MY DEAR RETURNED TOM IN A DELIGHTED STATE WHY NOT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT WRITING COPPERFIELD ITS EXTRAORDINARILY LEGAL AND FORMAL SAID I I DONT THINK I EVER SAW SUCH A STIFF HAND NOT LIKE A LADYS HAND IS IT SAID TRADDLES A LADYS I REPEATED BRICKS AND MORTAR ARE MORE LIKE A LADYS HAND TRADDLES BROKE INTO A RAPTUROUS LAUGH AND INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS SOPHYS WRITING THAT SOPHY HAD VOWED AND DECLARED HE WOULD NEED A COPYINGCLERK SOON AND SHE WOULD BE THAT CLERK THAT SHE HAD ACQUIRED THIS HAND FROM A PATTERN AND THAT SHE COULD THROW OFFI FORGET HOW MANY FOLIOS AN HOUR SOPHY WAS VERY MUCH CONFUSED BY MY BEING TOLD ALL THIS AND SAID THAT WHEN TOM WAS MADE A JUDGE HE WOULDNT BE SO READY TO PROCLAIM IT WHICH TOM DENIED AVERRING THAT HE SHOULD ALWAYS BE EQUALLY PROUD OF IT UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT A THOROUGHLY GOOD AND CHARMING WIFE SHE IS MY DEAR TRADDLES SAID I WHEN SHE HAD GONE AWAY LAUGHING MY DEAR COPPERFIELD RETURNED TRADDLES SHE IS WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION THE DEAREST GIRL THE WAY SHE MANAGES THIS PLACE HER PUNCTUALITY DOMESTIC KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY AND ORDER HER CHEERFULNESS COPPERFIELD INDEED YOU HAVE REASON TO COMMEND HER I RETURNED YOU ARE A HAPPY FELLOW I BELIEVE YOU MAKE YOURSELVES AND EACH OTHER TWO OF THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD I AM SURE WE ARE TWO OF THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE RETURNED TRADDLES I ADMIT THAT AT ALL EVENTS BLESS MY SOUL WHEN I SEE HER GETTING UP BY CANDLELIGHT ON THESE DARK MORNINGS BUSYING HERSELF IN THE DAYS ARRANGEMENTS GOING OUT TO MARKET BEFORE THE CLERKS COME INTO THE INN CARING FOR NO WEATHER DEVISING THE MOST CAPITAL LITTLE DINNERS OUT OF THE PLAINEST MATERIALS MAKING PUDDINGS AND PIES KEEPING EVERYTHING IN ITS RIGHT PLACE ALWAYS SO NEAT AND ORNAMENTAL HERSELF SITTING UP AT NIGHT WITH ME IF ITS EVER SO LATE SWEETTEMPERED AND ENCOURAGING ALWAYS AND ALL FOR ME I POSITIVELY SOMETIMES CANT BELIEVE IT COPPERFIELD HE WAS TENDER OF THE VERY SLIPPERS SHE HAD BEEN WARMING AS HE PUT THEM ON AND STRETCHED HIS FEET ENJOYINGLY UPON THE FENDER I POSITIVELY SOMETIMES CANT BELIEVE IT SAID TRADDLES THEN OUR PLEASURES DEAR ME THEY ARE INEXPENSIVE BUT THEY ARE QUITE WONDERFUL WHEN WE ARE AT HOME HERE OF AN EVENING AND SHUT THE OUTER DOOR AND DRAW THOSE CURTAINSWHICH SHE MADEWHERE COULD WE BE MORE SNUG WHEN ITS FINE AND WE GO OUT FOR A WALK IN THE EVENING THE STREETS ABOUND IN ENJOYMENT FOR US WE LOOK INTO THE GLITTERING WINDOWS OF THE JEWELLERS SHOPS AND I SHOW SOPHY WHICH OF THE DIAMONDEYED SERPENTS COILED UP ON WHITE SATIN RISING GROUNDS I WOULD GIVE HER IF I COULD AFFORD IT AND SOPHY SHOWS ME WHICH OF THE GOLD WATCHES THAT ARE CAPPED AND JEWELLED AND ENGINETURNED AND POSSESSED OF THE HORIZONTAL LEVERESCAPEMOVEMENT AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS SHE WOULD BUY FOR ME IF SHE COULD AFFORD IT AND WE PICK OUT THE SPOONS AND FORKS FISHSLICES BUTTERKNIVES AND SUGARTONGS WE SHOULD BOTH PREFER IF WE COULD BOTH AFFORD IT AND REALLY WE GO AWAY AS IF WE HAD GOT THEM THEN WHEN WE STROLL INTO THE SQUARES AND GREAT STREETS AND SEE A HOUSE TO LET SOMETIMES WE LOOK UP AT IT AND SAY HOW WOULD THAT DO IF I WAS MADE A JUDGE AND WE PARCEL IT OUTSUCH A ROOM FOR US SUCH ROOMS FOR THE GIRLS AND SO FORTH UNTIL WE SETTLE TO OUR SATISFACTION THAT IT WOULD DO OR IT WOULDNT DO AS THE CASE MAY BE SOMETIMES WE GO AT HALFPRICE TO THE PIT OF THE THEATRETHE VERY SMELL OF WHICH IS CHEAP IN MY OPINION AT THE MONEYAND THERE WE THOROUGHLY ENJOY THE PLAY WHICH SOPHY BELIEVES EVERY WORD OF AND SO DO I IN WALKING HOME PERHAPS WE BUY A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING AT A COOKSSHOP OR A LITTLE LOBSTER AT THE FISHMONGERS AND BRING IT HERE AND MAKE A SPLENDID SUPPER CHATTING ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN NOW YOU KNOW COPPERFIELD IF I WAS LORD CHANCELLOR WE COULDNT DO THIS YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING WHATEVER YOU WERE MY DEAR TRADDLES THOUGHT I THAT WOULD BE PLEASANT AND AMIABLE AND BY THE WAY I SAID ALOUD I SUPPOSE YOU NEVER DRAW ANY SKELETONS NOW REALLY REPLIED TRADDLES LAUGHING AND REDDENING I CANT WHOLLY DENY THAT I DO MY DEAR COPPERFIELD FOR BEING IN ONE OF THE BACK ROWS OF THE KINGS BENCH THE OTHER DAY WITH A PEN IN MY HAND THE FANCY CAME INTO MY HEAD TO TRY HOW I HAD PRESERVED THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT AND I AM AFRAID THERES A SKELETONIN A WIGON THE LEDGE OF THE DESK AFTER WE HAD BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY TRADDLES WOUND UP BY LOOKING WITH A SMILE AT THE FIRE AND SAYING IN HIS FORGIVING WAY OLD CREAKLE I HAVE A LETTER FROM THAT OLDRASCAL HERE SAID I FOR I NEVER WAS LESS DISPOSED TO FORGIVE HIM THE WAY HE USED TO BATTER TRADDLES THAN WHEN I SAW TRADDLES SO READY TO FORGIVE HIM HIMSELF FROM CREAKLE THE SCHOOLMASTER EXCLAIMED TRADDLES NO AMONG THE PERSONS WHO ARE ATTRACTED TO ME IN MY RISING FAME AND FORTUNE SAID I LOOKING OVER MY LETTERS AND WHO DISCOVER THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME IS THE SELFSAME CREAKLE HE IS NOT A SCHOOLMASTER NOW TRADDLES HE IS RETIRED HE IS A MIDDLESEX MAGISTRATE I THOUGHT TRADDLES MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO HEAR IT BUT HE WAS NOT SO AT ALL HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE HE COMES TO BE A MIDDLESEX MAGISTRATE SAID I OH DEAR ME REPLIED TRADDLES IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION PERHAPS HE VOTED FOR SOMEBODY OR LENT MONEY TO SOMEBODY OR BOUGHT SOMETHING OF SOMEBODY OR OTHERWISE OBLIGED SOMEBODY OR JOBBED FOR SOMEBODY WHO KNEW SOMEBODY WHO GOT THE LIEUTENANT OF THE COUNTY TO NOMINATE HIM FOR THE COMMISSION ON THE COMMISSION HE IS AT ANY RATE SAID I AND HE WRITES TO ME HERE THAT HE WILL BE GLAD TO SHOW ME IN OPERATION THE ONLY TRUE SYSTEM OF PRISON DISCIPLINE THE ONLY UNCHALLENGEABLE WAY OF MAKING SINCERE AND LASTING CONVERTS AND PENITENTSWHICH YOU KNOW IS BY SOLITARY CONFINEMENT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE SYSTEM INQUIRED TRADDLES LOOKING GRAVE NO TO MY ACCEPTING THE OFFER AND YOUR GOING WITH ME I DONT OBJECT SAID TRADDLES THEN ILL WRITE TO SAY SO YOU REMEMBER TO SAY NOTHING OF OUR TREATMENT THIS SAME CREAKLE TURNING HIS SON OUT OF DOORS I SUPPOSE AND THE LIFE HE USED TO LEAD HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER PERFECTLY SAID TRADDLES YET IF YOULL READ HIS LETTER YOULL FIND HE IS THE TENDEREST OF MEN TO PRISONERS CONVICTED OF THE WHOLE CALENDAR OF FELONIES SAID I THOUGH I CANT FIND THAT HIS TENDERNESS EXTENDS TO ANY OTHER CLASS OF CREATED BEINGS TRADDLES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WAS NOT AT ALL SURPRISED I HAD NOT EXPECTED HIM TO BE AND WAS NOT SURPRISED MYSELF OR MY OBSERVATION OF SIMILAR PRACTICAL SATIRES WOULD HAVE BEEN BUT SCANTY WE ARRANGED THE TIME OF OUR VISIT AND I WROTE ACCORDINGLY TO MR CREAKLE THAT EVENING ON THE APPOINTED DAYI THINK IT WAS THE NEXT DAY BUT NO MATTERTRADDLES AND I REPAIRED TO THE PRISON WHERE MR CREAKLE WAS POWERFUL IT WAS AN IMMENSE AND SOLID BUILDING ERECTED AT A VAST EXPENSE I COULD NOT HELP THINKING AS WE APPROACHED THE GATE WHAT AN UPROAR WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE COUNTRY IF ANY DELUDED MAN HAD PROPOSED TO SPEND ONE HALF THE MONEY IT HAD COST ON THE ERECTION OF AN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL FOR THE YOUNG OR A HOUSE OF REFUGE FOR THE DESERVING OLD IN AN OFFICE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON THE GROUNDFLOOR OF THE TOWER OF BABEL IT WAS SO MASSIVELY CONSTRUCTED WE WERE PRESENTED TO OUR OLD SCHOOLMASTER WHO WAS ONE OF A GROUP COMPOSED OF TWO OR THREE OF THE BUSIER SORT OF MAGISTRATES AND SOME VISITORS THEY HAD BROUGHT HE RECEIVED ME LIKE A MAN WHO HAD FORMED MY MIND IN BYGONE YEARS AND HAD ALWAYS LOVED ME TENDERLY ON MY INTRODUCING TRADDLES MR CREAKLE EXPRESSED IN LIKE MANNER BUT IN AN INFERIOR DEGREE THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN TRADDLESS GUIDE PHILOSOPHER AND FRIEND OUR VENERABLE INSTRUCTOR WAS A GREAT DEAL OLDER AND NOT IMPROVED IN APPEARANCE HIS FACE WAS AS FIERY AS EVER HIS EYES WERE AS SMALL AND RATHER DEEPER SET THE SCANTY WETLOOKING GREY HAIR BY WHICH I REMEMBERED HIM WAS ALMOST GONE AND THE THICK VEINS IN HIS BALD HEAD WERE NONE THE MORE AGREEABLE TO LOOK AT AFTER SOME CONVERSATION AMONG THESE GENTLEMEN FROM WHICH I MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE WORLD TO BE LEGITIMATELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BUT THE SUPREME COMFORT OF PRISONERS AT ANY EXPENSE AND NOTHING ON THE WIDE EARTH TO BE DONE OUTSIDE PRISONDOORS WE BEGAN OUR INSPECTION IT BEING THEN JUST DINNERTIME WE WENT FIRST INTO THE GREAT KITCHEN WHERE EVERY PRISONERS DINNER WAS IN COURSE OF BEING SET OUT SEPARATELY TO BE HANDED TO HIM IN HIS CELL WITH THE REGULARITY AND PRECISION OF CLOCKWORK I SAID ASIDE TO TRADDLES THAT I WONDERED WHETHER IT OCCURRED TO ANYBODY THAT THERE WAS A STRIKING CONTRAST BETWEEN THESE PLENTIFUL REPASTS OF CHOICE QUALITY AND THE DINNERS NOT TO SAY OF PAUPERS BUT OF SOLDIERS SAILORS LABOURERS THE GREAT BULK OF THE HONEST WORKING COMMUNITY OF WHOM NOT ONE MAN IN FIVE HUNDRED EVER DINED HALF SO WELL BUT I LEARNED THAT THE SYSTEM REQUIRED HIGH LIVING AND IN SHORT TO DISPOSE OF THE SYSTEM ONCE FOR ALL I FOUND THAT ON THAT HEAD AND ON ALL OTHERS THE SYSTEM PUT AN END TO ALL DOUBTS AND DISPOSED OF ALL ANOMALIES NOBODY APPEARED TO HAVE THE LEAST IDEA THAT THERE WAS ANY OTHER SYSTEM BUT THE SYSTEM TO BE CONSIDERED AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH SOME OF THE MAGNIFICENT PASSAGES I INQUIRED OF MR CREAKLE AND HIS FRIENDS WHAT WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THE MAIN ADVANTAGES OF THIS ALLGOVERNING AND UNIVERSALLY OVERRIDING SYSTEM I FOUND THEM TO BE THE PERFECT ISOLATION OF PRISONERSSO THAT NO ONE MAN IN CONFINEMENT THERE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT ANOTHER AND THE REDUCTION OF PRISONERS TO A WHOLESOME STATE OF MIND LEADING TO SINCERE CONTRITION AND REPENTANCE NOW IT STRUCK ME WHEN WE BEGAN TO VISIT INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR CELLS AND TO TRAVERSE THE PASSAGES IN WHICH THOSE CELLS WERE AND TO HAVE THE MANNER OF THE GOING TO CHAPEL AND SO FORTH EXPLAINED TO US THAT THERE WAS A STRONG PROBABILITY OF THE PRISONERS KNOWING A GOOD DEAL ABOUT EACH OTHER AND OF THEIR CARRYING ON A PRETTY COMPLETE SYSTEM OF INTERCOURSE THIS AT THE TIME I WRITE HAS BEEN PROVED I BELIEVE TO BE THE CASE BUT AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FLAT BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE SYSTEM TO HAVE HINTED SUCH A DOUBT THEN I LOOKED OUT FOR THE PENITENCE AS DILIGENTLY AS I COULD AND HERE AGAIN I HAD GREAT MISGIVINGS I FOUND AS PREVALENT A FASHION IN THE FORM OF THE PENITENCE AS I HAD LEFT OUTSIDE IN THE FORMS OF THE COATS AND WAISTCOATS IN THE WINDOWS OF THE TAILORS SHOPS I FOUND A VAST AMOUNT OF PROFESSION VARYING VERY LITTLE IN CHARACTER VARYING VERY LITTLE WHICH I THOUGHT EXCEEDINGLY SUSPICIOUS EVEN IN WORDS I FOUND A GREAT MANY FOXES DISPARAGING WHOLE VINEYARDS OF INACCESSIBLE GRAPES BUT I FOUND VERY FEW FOXES WHOM I WOULD HAVE TRUSTED WITHIN REACH OF A BUNCH ABOVE ALL I FOUND THAT THE MOST PROFESSING MEN WERE THE GREATEST OBJECTS OF INTEREST AND THAT THEIR CONCEIT THEIR VANITY THEIR WANT OF EXCITEMENT AND THEIR LOVE OF DECEPTION WHICH MANY OF THEM POSSESSED TO AN ALMOST INCREDIBLE EXTENT AS THEIR HISTORIES SHOWED ALL PROMPTED TO THESE PROFESSIONS AND WERE ALL GRATIFIED BY THEM HOWEVER I HEARD SO REPEATEDLY IN THE COURSE OF OUR GOINGS TO AND FRO OF A CERTAIN NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN WHO WAS THE FAVOURITE AND WHO REALLY APPEARED TO BE A MODEL PRISONER THAT I RESOLVED TO SUSPEND MY JUDGEMENT UNTIL I SHOULD SEE TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT I UNDERSTOOD WAS ALSO A BRIGHT PARTICULAR STAR BUT IT WAS HIS MISFORTUNE TO HAVE HIS GLORY A LITTLE DIMMED BY THE EXTRAORDINARY LUSTRE OF TWENTY SEVEN I HEARD SO MUCH OF TWENTY SEVEN OF HIS PIOUS ADMONITIONS TO EVERYBODY AROUND HIM AND OF THE BEAUTIFUL LETTERS HE CONSTANTLY WROTE TO HIS MOTHER WHOM HE SEEMED TO CONSIDER IN A VERY BAD WAY THAT I BECAME QUITE IMPATIENT TO SEE HIM I HAD TO RESTRAIN MY IMPATIENCE FOR SOME TIME ON ACCOUNT OF TWENTY SEVEN BEING RESERVED FOR A CONCLUDING EFFECT BUT AT LAST WE CAME TO THE DOOR OF HIS CELL AND MR CREAKLE LOOKING THROUGH A LITTLE HOLE IN IT REPORTED TO US IN A STATE OF THE GREATEST ADMIRATION THAT HE WAS READING A HYMN BOOK THERE WAS SUCH A RUSH OF HEADS IMMEDIATELY TO SEE NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN READING HIS HYMN BOOK THAT THE LITTLE HOLE WAS BLOCKED UP SIX OR SEVEN HEADS DEEP TO REMEDY THIS INCONVENIENCE AND GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY OF CONVERSING WITH TWENTY SEVEN IN ALL HIS PURITY MR CREAKLE DIRECTED THE DOOR OF THE CELL TO BE UNLOCKED AND TWENTY SEVEN TO BE INVITED OUT INTO THE PASSAGE THIS WAS DONE AND WHOM SHOULD TRADDLES AND I THEN BEHOLD TO OUR AMAZEMENT IN THIS CONVERTED NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN BUT URIAH HEEP HE KNEW US DIRECTLY AND SAID AS HE CAME OUTWITH THE OLD WRITHE HOW DO YOU DO MR COPPERFIELD HOW DO YOU DO MR TRADDLES THIS RECOGNITION CAUSED A GENERAL ADMIRATION IN THE PARTY I RATHER THOUGHT THAT EVERYONE WAS STRUCK BY HIS NOT BEING PROUD AND TAKING NOTICE OF US WELL TWENTY SEVEN SAID MR CREAKLE MOURNFULLY ADMIRING HIM HOW DO YOU FIND YOURSELF TODAY I AM VERY UMBLE SIR REPLIED URIAH HEEP YOU ARE ALWAYS SO TWENTY SEVEN SAID MR CREAKLE HERE ANOTHER GENTLEMAN ASKED WITH EXTREME ANXIETY ARE YOU QUITE COMFORTABLE YES I THANK YOU SIR SAID URIAH HEEP LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION FAR MORE COMFORTABLE HERE THAN

DO YOU FIND THE BEEF THANK YOU SIR REPLIED URIAH GLANCING IN THE NEW DIRECTION OF THIS VOICE IT WAS TOUGHER YESTERDAY THAN I COULD WISH BUT ITS MY DUTY TO BEAR I HAVE COMMITTED FOLLIES GENTLEMEN SAID URIAH LOOKING ROUND WITH A MEEK SMILE AND I OUGHT TO BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES WITHOUT REPINING A MURMUR PARTLY OF GRATIFICATION AT TWENTY SEVENS CELESTIAL STATE OF MIND AND PARTLY OF INDIGNATION AGAINST THE CONTRACTOR WHO HAD GIVEN HIM ANY CAUSE OF COMPLAINT A NOTE OF WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY MADE BY MR CREAKLE HAVING SUBSIDED TWENTY SEVEN STOOD IN THE MIDST OF US AS IF HE FELT HIMSELF THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MERIT IN A HIGHLY MERITORIOUS MUSEUM THAT WE THE NEOPHYTES MIGHT HAVE AN EXCESS OF LIGHT SHINING UPON US ALL AT ONCE ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO LET OUT TWENTY EIGHT I HAD BEEN SO MUCH ASTONISHED ALREADY THAT I ONLY FELT A KIND OF RESIGNED WONDER WHEN MR LITTIMER WALKED FORTH READING A GOOD BOOK TWENTY EIGHT SAID A GENTLEMAN IN SPECTACLES WHO HAD NOT YET SPOKEN YOU COMPLAINED LAST WEEK MY GOOD FELLOW OF THE COCOA HOW HAS IT BEEN SINCE I THANK YOU SIR SAID MR LITTIMER IT HAS BEEN BETTER MADE IF I MIGHT TAKE THE LIBERTY OF SAYING SO SIR I DONT THINK THE MILK WHICH IS BOILED WITH IT IS QUITE GENUINE BUT I AM AWARE SIR THAT THERE IS A GREAT ADULTERATION OF MILK IN LONDON AND THAT THE ARTICLE IN A PURE STATE IS DIFFICULT TO BE OBTAINED IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE GENTLEMAN IN SPECTACLES BACKED HIS TWENTY EIGHT AGAINST MR CREAKLES TWENTY SEVEN FOR EACH OF THEM TOOK HIS OWN MAN IN HAND WHAT IS YOUR STATE OF MIND TWENTY EIGHT SAID THE QUESTIONER IN SPECTACLES I THANK YOU SIR RETURNED MR LITTIMER I SEE MY FOLLIES NOW SIR I AM A GOOD DEAL TROUBLED WHEN I THINK OF THE SINS OF MY FORMER COMPANIONS SIR BUT I TRUST THEY MAY FIND FORGIVENESS YOU ARE QUITE HAPPY YOURSELF SAID THE QUESTIONER NODDING ENCOURAGEMENT I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU SIR RETURNED MR LITTIMER PERFECTLY SO IS THERE ANYTHING AT ALL ON YOUR MIND NOW SAID THE QUESTIONER IF SO MENTION IT TWENTY EIGHT SIR SAID MR LITTIMER WITHOUT LOOKING UP IF MY EYES HAVE NOT DECEIVED ME THERE IS A GENTLEMAN PRESENT WHO WAS ACQUAINTED WITH ME IN MY FORMER LIFE IT MAY BE PROFITABLE TO THAT GENTLEMAN TO KNOW SIR THAT I ATTRIBUTE MY PAST FOLLIES ENTIRELY TO HAVING LIVED A THOUGHTLESS LIFE IN THE SERVICE OF YOUNG MEN AND TO HAVING ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE LED BY THEM INTO WEAKNESSES WHICH I HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO RESIST I HOPE THAT GENTLEMAN WILL TAKE WARNING SIR AND WILL NOT BE OFFENDED AT MY FREEDOM IT IS FOR HIS GOOD I AM CONSCIOUS OF MY OWN PAST FOLLIES I HOPE HE MAY REPENT OF ALL THE WICKEDNESS AND SIN TO WHICH HE HAS BEEN A PARTY I OBSERVED THAT SEVERAL GENTLEMEN WERE SHADING THEIR EYES EACH WITH ONE HAND AS IF THEY HAD JUST COME INTO CHURCH THIS DOES YOU CREDIT TWENTY EIGHT RETURNED THE QUESTIONER I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT OF YOU IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE SIR RETURNED MR LITTIMER SLIGHTLY LIFTING UP HIS EYEBROWS BUT NOT HIS EYES THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO FELL INTO DISSOLUTE COURSES THAT I ENDEAVOURED TO SAVE SIR BUT COULD NOT RESCUE I BEG THAT GENTLEMAN IF HE HAS IT IN HIS POWER TO INFORM THAT YOUNG WOMAN FROM ME THAT I FORGIVE HER HER BAD CONDUCT TOWARDS MYSELF AND THAT I CALL HER TO REPENTANCEIF HE WILL

MALEVOLENT HEAD FOR LEAVE TO WRITE AGAIN TO MOTHER IT SHALL CERTAINLY BE GRANTED SAID MR CREAKLE THANK YOU SIR I AM ANXIOUS ABOUT MOTHER I AM AFRAID SHE AINT SAFE SOMEBODY INCAUTIOUSLY ASKED WHAT FROM

BACK INTO HIS CELL AMIDST A LITTLE CHORUS OF APPROBATION AND BOTH TRADDLES AND I EXPERIENCED A GREAT RELIEF WHEN HE WAS LOCKED IN IT WAS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE IN THIS REPENTANCE THAT I WAS FAIN TO ASK WHAT THESE TWO MEN HAD DONE TO BE THERE AT ALL THAT APPEARED TO BE THE LAST THING ABOUT WHICH THEY HAD ANYTHING TO SAY I ADDRESSED MYSELF TO ONE OF THE TWO WARDERS WHO I SUSPECTED FROM CERTAIN LATENT INDICATIONS IN THEIR FACES KNEW PRETTY WELL WHAT ALL THIS STIR WAS WORTH DO YOU KNOW SAID I AS WE WALKED ALONG THE PASSAGE WHAT FELONY WAS NUMBER TWENTY SEVENS LAST FOLLY THE ANSWER WAS THAT IT WAS A BANK CASE A FRAUD ON THE BANK OF ENGLAND I ASKED YES SIR FRAUD FORGERY AND CONSPIRACY HE AND SOME OTHERS HE SET THE OTHERS ON IT WAS A DEEP PLOT FOR A LARGE SUM SENTENCE TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE TWENTY SEVEN WAS THE KNOWINGEST BIRD OF THE LOT AND HAD VERY NEARLY KEPT HIMSELF SAFE BUT NOT QUITE THE BANK WAS JUST ABLE TO PUT SALT UPON HIS TAILAND ONLY JUST DO YOU KNOW TWENTY EIGHTS OFFENCE TWENTY EIGHT RETURNED MY INFORMANT SPEAKING THROUGHOUT IN A LOW TONE AND LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER AS WE WALKED ALONG THE PASSAGE TO GUARD HIMSELF FROM BEING OVERHEARD IN SUCH AN UNLAWFUL REFERENCE TO THESE IMMACULATES BY CREAKLE AND THE REST TWENTY EIGHT ALSO TRANSPORTATION GOT A PLACE AND ROBBED A YOUNG MASTER OF A MATTER OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS IN MONEY AND VALUABLES THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY WERE GOING ABROAD I PARTICULARLY RECOLLECT HIS CASE FROM HIS BEING TOOK BY A DWARF A WHAT A LITTLE WOMAN I HAVE FORGOT HER NAME NOT MOWCHER THATS IT HE HAD ELUDED PURSUIT AND WAS GOING TO AMERICA IN A FLAXEN WIG AND WHISKERS AND SUCH A COMPLETE DISGUISE AS NEVER YOU SEE IN ALL YOUR BORN DAYS WHEN THE LITTLE WOMAN BEING IN SOUTHAMPTON MET HIM WALKING ALONG THE STREETPICKED HIM OUT WITH HER SHARP EYE IN A MOMENTRAN BETWIXT HIS LEGS TO UPSET HIMAND HELD ON TO HIM LIKE GRIM DEATH EXCELLENT MISS MOWCHER CRIED I YOUD HAVE SAID SO IF YOU HAD SEEN HER STANDING ON A CHAIR IN THE WITNESSBOX AT THE TRIAL AS I DID SAID MY FRIEND HE CUT HER FACE RIGHT OPEN AND POUNDED HER IN THE MOST BRUTAL MANNER WHEN SHE TOOK HIM BUT SHE NEVER LOOSED HER HOLD TILL HE WAS LOCKED UP SHE HELD SO TIGHT TO HIM IN FACT THAT THE OFFICERS WERE OBLIGED TO TAKE EM BOTH TOGETHER SHE GAVE HER EVIDENCE IN THE GAMEST WAY AND WAS HIGHLY COMPLIMENTED BY THE BENCH AND CHEERED RIGHT HOME TO HER LODGINGS SHE SAID IN COURT THAT SHED HAVE TOOK HIM SINGLEHANDED ON ACCOUNT OF WHAT SHE KNEW CONCERNING HIM IF HE HAD BEEN SAMSON AND ITS MY BELIEF SHE WOULD IT WAS MINE TOO AND I HIGHLY RESPECTED MISS MOWCHER FOR IT WE HAD NOW SEEN ALL THERE WAS TO SEE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN TO REPRESENT TO SUCH A MAN AS THE WORSHIPFUL MR CREAKLE THAT TWENTY SEVEN AND TWENTY EIGHT WERE PERFECTLY CONSISTENT AND UNCHANGED THAT EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE THEN THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN THAT THE HYPOCRITICAL KNAVES WERE JUST THE SUBJECTS TO MAKE THAT SORT OF PROFESSION IN SUCH A PLACE THAT THEY KNEW ITS MARKETVALUE AT LEAST AS WELL AS WE DID IN THE IMMEDIATE SERVICE IT WOULD DO THEM WHEN THEY WERE EXPATRIATED IN A WORD THAT IT WAS A ROTTEN HOLLOW PAINFULLY SUGGESTIVE PIECE OF BUSINESS ALTOGETHER WE LEFT THEM TO THEIR SYSTEM AND THEMSELVES AND WENT HOME WONDERING PERHAPS ITS A GOOD THING TRADDLES SAID I TO HAVE AN UNSOUND HOBBY RIDDEN HARD FOR ITS THE SOONER RIDDEN TO DEATH I HOPE SO REPLIED TRADDLES CHAPTER A LIGHT SHINES ON MY WAY THE YEAR CAME ROUND TO CHRISTMASTIME AND I HAD BEEN AT HOME ABOVE TWO MONTHS I HAD SEEN AGNES FREQUENTLY HOWEVER LOUD THE GENERAL VOICE MIGHT BE IN GIVING ME ENCOURAGEMENT AND HOWEVER FERVENT THE EMOTIONS AND ENDEAVOURS TO WHICH IT ROUSED ME I HEARD HER LIGHTEST WORD OF PRAISE AS I HEARD NOTHING ELSE AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK AND SOMETIMES OFTENER I RODE OVER THERE AND PASSED THE EVENING I USUALLY RODE BACK AT NIGHT FOR THE OLD UNHAPPY SENSE WAS ALWAYS HOVERING ABOUT ME NOWMOST SORROWFULLY WHEN I LEFT HERAND I WAS GLAD TO BE UP AND OUT RATHER THAN WANDERING OVER THE PAST IN WEARY WAKEFULNESS OR MISERABLE DREAMS I WORE AWAY THE LONGEST PART OF MANY WILD SAD NIGHTS IN THOSE RIDES REVIVING AS I WENT THE THOUGHTS THAT HAD OCCUPIED ME IN MY LONG ABSENCE OR IF I WERE TO SAY RATHER THAT I LISTENED TO THE ECHOES OF THOSE THOUGHTS I SHOULD BETTER EXPRESS THE TRUTH THEY SPOKE TO ME FROM AFAR OFF I HAD PUT THEM AT A DISTANCE AND ACCEPTED MY INEVITABLE PLACE WHEN I READ TO AGNES WHAT I WROTE WHEN I SAW HER LISTENING FACE MOVED HER TO SMILES OR TEARS AND HEARD HER CORDIAL VOICE SO EARNEST ON THE SHADOWY EVENTS OF THAT IMAGINATIVE WORLD IN WHICH I LIVED I THOUGHT WHAT A FATE MINE MIGHT HAVE BEENBUT ONLY THOUGHT SO AS I HAD THOUGHT AFTER I WAS MARRIED TO DORA WHAT I COULD HAVE WISHED MY WIFE TO BE MY DUTY TO AGNES WHO LOVED ME WITH A LOVE WHICH IF I DISQUIETED I WRONGED MOST SELFISHLY AND POORLY AND COULD NEVER RESTORE MY MATURED ASSURANCE THAT I WHO HAD WORKED OUT MY OWN DESTINY AND WON WHAT I HAD IMPETUOUSLY SET MY HEART ON HAD NO RIGHT TO MURMUR AND MUST BEAR COMPRISED WHAT I FELT AND WHAT I HAD LEARNED BUT I LOVED HER AND NOW IT EVEN BECAME SOME CONSOLATION TO ME VAGUELY TO CONCEIVE A DISTANT DAY WHEN I MIGHT BLAMELESSLY AVOW IT WHEN ALL THIS SHOULD BE OVER WHEN I COULD SAY AGNES SO IT WAS WHEN I CAME HOME AND NOW I AM OLD AND I NEVER HAVE LOVED SINCE SHE DID NOT ONCE SHOW ME ANY CHANGE IN HERSELF WHAT SHE ALWAYS HAD BEEN TO ME SHE STILL WAS WHOLLY UNALTERED BETWEEN MY AUNT AND ME THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING IN THIS CONNEXION SINCE THE NIGHT OF MY RETURN WHICH I CANNOT CALL A RESTRAINT OR AN AVOIDANCE OF THE SUBJECT SO MUCH AS AN IMPLIED UNDERSTANDING THAT WE THOUGHT OF IT TOGETHER BUT DID NOT SHAPE OUR THOUGHTS INTO WORDS WHEN ACCORDING TO OUR OLD CUSTOM WE SAT BEFORE THE FIRE AT NIGHT WE OFTEN FELL INTO THIS TRAIN AS NATURALLY AND AS CONSCIOUSLY TO EACH OTHER AS IF WE HAD UNRESERVEDLY SAID SO BUT WE PRESERVED AN UNBROKEN SILENCE I BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD READ OR PARTLY READ MY THOUGHTS THAT NIGHT AND THAT SHE FULLY COMPREHENDED WHY I GAVE MINE NO MORE DISTINCT

NEVER SITTING DOWN TO IT WITHOUT A BIT OF WAX CANDLE A YARDMEASURE IN A LITTLE HOUSE AND A WORKBOX WITH A PICTURE OF ST PAULS UPON THE LID THE CHEEKS AND ARMS OF PEGGOTTY SO HARD AND RED IN MY CHILDISH DAYS WHEN I WONDERED WHY THE BIRDS DIDNT PECK HER IN PREFERENCE TO APPLES ARE SHRIVELLED NOW AND HER EYES THAT USED TO DARKEN THEIR WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN HER FACE ARE FAINTER THOUGH THEY GLITTER STILL BUT HER ROUGH FOREFINGER WHICH I ONCE ASSOCIATED WITH A POCKET NUTMEGGRATER IS JUST THE SAME AND WHEN I SEE MY LEAST CHILD CATCHING AT IT AS IT TOTTERS FROM MY AUNT TO HER I THINK OF OUR LITTLE PARLOUR AT HOME WHEN I COULD SCARCELY WALK MY AUNTS OLD DISAPPOINTMENT IS SET RIGHT NOW SHE IS GODMOTHER TO A REAL LIVING BETSEY TROTWOOD AND DORA THE NEXT IN ORDER SAYS SHE SPOILS HER THERE IS SOMETHING BULKY IN PEGGOTTYS POCKET IT IS NOTHING SMALLER THAN THE CROCODILE BOOK WHICH IS IN RATHER A DILAPIDATED CONDITION BY THIS TIME WITH DIVERS OF THE LEAVES TORN AND STITCHED ACROSS BUT WHICH PEGGOTTY EXHIBITS TO THE CHILDREN AS A PRECIOUS RELIC I FIND IT VERY CURIOUS TO SEE MY OWN INFANT FACE LOOKING UP AT ME FROM THE CROCODILE STORIES AND TO BE REMINDED BY IT OF MY OLD ACQUAINTANCE BROOKS OF SHEFFIELD AMONG MY BOYS THIS SUMMER HOLIDAY TIME I SEE AN OLD MAN MAKING GIANT KITES AND GAZING AT THEM IN THE AIR WITH A DELIGHT FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO WORDS HE GREETS ME RAPTUROUSLY AND
