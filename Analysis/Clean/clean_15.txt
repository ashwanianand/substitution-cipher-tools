WORK IT IS THE HISTORY OF HIS MOST INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES OF HIS FRIENDSHIPS IDEALS RAPTURES BITTEREST DISAPPOINTMENTS AND SORROWS ABOVE IT ALL HOWEVER THERE SOARS TRANSFIGURING IT THE IMAGE OF HIS GREATEST HOPES AND REMOTEST AIMS MY BROTHER HAD THE FIGURE OF ZARATHUSTRA IN HIS MIND FROM HIS VERY EARLIEST YOUTH HE ONCE TOLD ME THAT EVEN AS A CHILD HE HAD DREAMT OF HIM AT DIFFERENT PERIODS IN HIS LIFE HE WOULD CALL THIS HAUNTER OF HIS DREAMS BY DIFFERENT NAMES BUT IN THE END HE DECLARES IN A NOTE ON THE SUBJECT I HAD TO DO A PERSIAN THE HONOUR OF IDENTIFYING HIM WITH THIS CREATURE OF MY FANCY PERSIANS WERE THE FIRST TO TAKE A BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF HISTORY EVERY SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS ACCORDING TO THEM WAS PRESIDED OVER BY A PROPHET AND EVERY PROPHET HAD HIS HAZARHIS DYNASTY OF A THOUSAND YEARS ALL ZARATHUSTRAS VIEWS AS ALSO HIS PERSONALITY WERE EARLY CONCEPTIONS OF MY BROTHERS MIND WHOEVER READS HIS POSTHUMOUSLY PUBLISHED WRITINGS FOR THE YEARS WITH CARE WILL CONSTANTLY MEET WITH PASSAGES SUGGESTIVE OF ZARATHUSTRAS THOUGHTS AND DOCTRINES FOR INSTANCE THE IDEAL OF THE SUPERMAN IS PUT FORTH QUITE CLEARLY IN ALL HIS WRITINGS DURING THE YEARS AND IN WE PHILOLOGISTS THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE OBSERVATIONS OCCUR HOW CAN ONE PRAISE AND GLORIFY A NATION AS A WHOLEEVEN AMONG THE GREEKS IT WAS THE INDIVIDUALS THAT COUNTED THE GREEKS ARE INTERESTING AND EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY REARED SUCH A VAST NUMBER OF GREAT INDIVIDUALS HOW WAS THIS POSSIBLE THE QUESTION IS ONE WHICH OUGHT TO BE STUDIED I AM INTERESTED ONLY IN THE RELATIONS OF A PEOPLE TO THE REARING OF THE INDIVIDUAL MAN AND AMONG THE GREEKS THE CONDITIONS WERE UNUSUALLY FAVOURABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL NOT BY ANY MEANS OWING TO THE GOODNESS OF THE PEOPLE BUT BECAUSE OF THE STRUGGLES OF THEIR EVIL INSTINCTS WITH THE HELP OF FAVOURABLE MEASURES GREAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE REARED WHO WOULD BE BOTH DIFFERENT FROM AND HIGHER THAN THOSE WHO HERETOFORE HAVE OWED THEIR EXISTENCE TO MERE CHANCE HERE WE MAY STILL BE HOPEFUL IN THE REARING OF EXCEPTIONAL MEN THE NOTION OF REARING THE SUPERMAN IS ONLY A NEW FORM OF AN IDEAL NIETZSCHE ALREADY HAD IN HIS YOUTH THAT THE OBJECT OF MANKIND SHOULD LIE IN ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS OR AS HE WRITES IN SCHOPENHAUER AS EDUCATOR MANKIND OUGHT CONSTANTLY TO BE STRIVING TO PRODUCE GREAT MENTHIS AND NOTHING ELSE IS ITS DUTY BUT THE IDEALS HE MOST REVERED IN THOSE DAYS ARE NO LONGER HELD TO BE THE HIGHEST TYPES OF MEN NO AROUND THIS FUTURE IDEAL OF A COMING HUMANITYTHE SUPERMANTHE POET SPREAD THE VEIL OF BECOMING WHO CAN TELL TO WHAT GLORIOUS HEIGHTS MAN CAN STILL ASCEND THAT IS WHY AFTER HAVING TESTED THE WORTH OF OUR NOBLEST IDEALTHAT OF THE SAVIOUR IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEW VALUATIONS THE POET CRIES WITH PASSIONATE EMPHASIS IN ZARATHUSTRA NEVER YET HATH THERE BEEN A SUPERMAN NAKED HAVE I SEEN BOTH OF THEM THE GREATEST AND THE SMALLEST MAN ALLTOOSIMILAR ARE THEY STILL TO EACH OTHER VERILY EVEN THE GREATEST FOUND IALLTOOHUMAN THE PHRASE THE REARING OF THE SUPERMAN HAS VERY OFTEN BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD BY THE WORD REARING IN THIS CASE IS MEANT THE ACT OF MODIFYING BY MEANS OF NEW AND HIGHER VALUESVALUES WHICH AS LAWS AND GUIDES OF CONDUCT AND OPINION ARE NOW TO RULE OVER MANKIND IN GENERAL THE DOCTRINE OF THE SUPERMAN CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER IDEAS OF THE AUTHORS SUCH ASTHE ORDER OF RANK THE WILL TO POWER AND THE TRANSVALUATION OF ALL VALUES HE ASSUMES THAT CHRISTIANITY AS A PRODUCT OF THE RESENTMENT OF THE BOTCHED AND THE WEAK HAS PUT IN BAN ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL STRONG PROUD AND POWERFUL IN FACT ALL THE QUALITIES RESULTING FROM STRENGTH AND THAT IN CONSEQUENCE ALL FORCES WHICH TEND TO PROMOTE OR ELEVATE LIFE HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY UNDERMINED NOW HOWEVER A NEW TABLE OF VALUATIONS MUST BE PLACED OVER MANKINDNAMELY THAT OF THE STRONG MIGHTY AND MAGNIFICENT MAN OVERFLOWING WITH LIFE AND ELEVATED TO HIS ZENITHTHE SUPERMAN WHO IS NOW PUT BEFORE US WITH OVERPOWERING PASSION AS THE AIM OF OUR LIFE HOPE AND WILL AND JUST AS THE OLD SYSTEM OF VALUING WHICH ONLY EXTOLLED THE QUALITIES FAVOURABLE TO THE WEAK THE SUFFERING AND THE OPPRESSED HAS SUCCEEDED IN PRODUCING A WEAK SUFFERING AND MODERN RACE SO THIS NEW AND REVERSED SYSTEM OF VALUING OUGHT TO REAR A HEALTHY STRONG LIVELY AND COURAGEOUS TYPE WHICH WOULD BE A GLORY TO LIFE ITSELF STATED BRIEFLY THE LEADING PRINCIPLE OF THIS NEW SYSTEM OF VALUING WOULD BE ALL THAT PROCEEDS FROM POWER IS GOOD ALL THAT SPRINGS FROM WEAKNESS IS BAD THIS TYPE MUST NOT BE REGARDED AS A FANCIFUL FIGURE IT IS NOT A NEBULOUS HOPE WHICH IS TO BE REALISED AT SOME INDEFINITELY REMOTE PERIOD THOUSANDS OF YEARS HENCE NOR IS IT A NEW SPECIES IN THE DARWINIAN SENSE OF WHICH WE CAN KNOW NOTHING AND WHICH IT WOULD THEREFORE BE SOMEWHAT ABSURD TO STRIVE AFTER BUT IT IS MEANT TO BE A POSSIBILITY WHICH MEN OF THE PRESENT COULD REALISE WITH ALL THEIR SPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL ENERGIES PROVIDED THEY ADOPTED THE NEW VALUES THE AUTHOR OF ZARATHUSTRA NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT EGREGIOUS EXAMPLE OF A TRANSVALUATION OF ALL VALUES THROUGH CHRISTIANITY WHEREBY THE WHOLE OF THE DEIFIED MODE OF LIFE AND THOUGHT OF THE GREEKS AS WELL AS STRONG ROMEDOM WAS ALMOST ANNIHILATED OR TRANSVALUED IN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME COULD NOT A REJUVENATED GRAECOROMAN SYSTEM OF VALUING ONCE IT HAD BEEN REFINED AND MADE MORE PROFOUND BY THE SCHOOLING WHICH TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF CHRISTIANITY HAD PROVIDED EFFECT ANOTHER SUCH REVOLUTION WITHIN A CALCULABLE PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THAT GLORIOUS TYPE OF MANHOOD SHALL FINALLY APPEAR WHICH IS TO BE OUR NEW FAITH AND HOPE AND IN THE CREATION OF WHICH ZARATHUSTRA EXHORTS US TO PARTICIPATE IN HIS PRIVATE NOTES ON THE SUBJECT THE AUTHOR USES THE EXPRESSION SUPERMAN ALWAYS IN THE SINGULAR BYTHEBYE AS SIGNIFYING THE MOST THOROUGHLY WELLCONSTITUTED TYPE AS OPPOSED TO MODERN MAN ABOVE ALL HOWEVER HE DESIGNATES ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE SUPERMAN IN ECCO HOMO HE IS CAREFUL TO ENLIGHTEN US CONCERNING THE PRECURSORS AND PREREQUISITES TO THE ADVENT OF THIS HIGHEST TYPE IN REFERRING TO A CERTAIN PASSAGE IN THE GAY SCIENCE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THIS TYPE WE MUST FIRST BE QUITE CLEAR IN REGARD TO THE LEADING PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION ON WHICH IT DEPENDS THIS CONDITION IS WHAT I CALL GREAT HEALTHINESS I KNOW NOT HOW TO EXPRESS MY MEANING MORE PLAINLY OR MORE PERSONALLY THAN I HAVE DONE ALREADY IN ONE OF THE LAST CHAPTERS APHORISM OF THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE GAYA SCIENZA WE THE NEW THE NAMELESS THE HARDTOUNDERSTANDIT SAYS THEREWE FIRSTLINGS OF A YET UNTRIED FUTUREWE REQUIRE FOR A NEW END ALSO A NEW MEANS NAMELY A NEW HEALTHINESS STRONGER SHARPER TOUGHER BOLDER AND MERRIER THAN ALL HEALTHINESS HITHERTO HE WHOSE SOUL LONGETH TO EXPERIENCE THE WHOLE RANGE OF HITHERTO RECOGNISED VALUES AND DESIRABILITIES AND TO CIRCUMNAVIGATE ALL THE COASTS OF THIS IDEAL MEDITERRANEAN SEA WHO FROM THE ADVENTURES OF HIS MOST PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WANTS TO KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO BE A CONQUEROR AND DISCOVERER OF THE IDEALAS LIKEWISE HOW IT IS WITH THE ARTIST THE SAINT THE LEGISLATOR THE SAGE THE SCHOLAR THE DEVOTEE THE PROPHET AND THE GODLY NONCONFORMIST OF THE OLD STYLEREQUIRES ONE THING ABOVE ALL FOR THAT PURPOSE GREAT HEALTHINESSSUCH HEALTHINESS AS ONE NOT ONLY POSSESSES BUT ALSO CONSTANTLY ACQUIRES AND MUST ACQUIRE BECAUSE ONE UNCEASINGLY SACRIFICES IT AGAIN AND MUST SACRIFICE ITAND NOW AFTER HAVING BEEN LONG ON THE WAY IN THIS FASHION WE ARGONAUTS OF THE IDEAL MORE COURAGEOUS PERHAPS THAN PRUDENT AND OFTEN ENOUGH SHIPWRECKED AND BROUGHT TO GRIEF NEVERTHELESS DANGEROUSLY HEALTHY ALWAYS HEALTHY AGAINIT WOULD SEEM AS IF IN RECOMPENSE FOR IT ALL THAT WE HAVE A STILL UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY BEFORE US THE BOUNDARIES OF WHICH NO ONE HAS YET SEEN A BEYOND TO ALL COUNTRIES AND CORNERS OF THE IDEAL KNOWN HITHERTO A WORLD SO OVERRICH IN THE BEAUTIFUL THE STRANGE THE QUESTIONABLE THE FRIGHTFUL AND THE DIVINE THAT OUR CURIOSITY AS WELL AS OUR THIRST FOR POSSESSION THEREOF HAVE GOT OUT OF HANDALAS THAT NOTHING WILL NOW ANY LONGER SATISFY US HOW COULD WE STILL BE CONTENT WITH THE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY AFTER SUCH OUTLOOKS AND WITH SUCH A CRAVING IN OUR CONSCIENCE AND CONSCIOUSNESS SAD ENOUGH BUT IT IS UNAVOIDABLE THAT WE SHOULD LOOK ON THE WORTHIEST AIMS AND HOPES OF THE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY WITH ILLCONCEALED AMUSEMENT AND PERHAPS SHOULD NO LONGER LOOK AT THEM ANOTHER IDEAL RUNS ON BEFORE US A STRANGE TEMPTING IDEAL FULL OF DANGER TO WHICH WE SHOULD NOT LIKE TO PERSUADE ANY ONE BECAUSE WE DO NOT SO READILY ACKNOWLEDGE ANY ONES RIGHT THERETO THE IDEAL OF A SPIRIT WHO PLAYS NAIVELY THAT IS TO SAY INVOLUNTARILY AND FROM OVERFLOWING ABUNDANCE AND POWER WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAS HITHERTO BEEN CALLED HOLY GOOD INTANGIBLE OR DIVINE TO WHOM THE LOFTIEST CONCEPTION WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE REASONABLY MADE THEIR MEASURE OF VALUE WOULD ALREADY PRACTICALLY IMPLY DANGER RUIN ABASEMENT OR AT LEAST RELAXATION BLINDNESS OR TEMPORARY SELFFORGETFULNESS THE IDEAL OF A HUMANLY SUPERHUMAN WELFARE AND BENEVOLENCE WHICH WILL OFTEN ENOUGH APPEAR INHUMAN FOR EXAMPLE WHEN PUT ALONGSIDE OF ALL PAST SERIOUSNESS ON EARTH AND ALONGSIDE OF ALL PAST SOLEMNITIES IN BEARING WORD TONE LOOK MORALITY AND PURSUIT AS THEIR TRUEST INVOLUNTARY PARODYAND WITH WHICH NEVERTHELESS PERHAPS THE GREAT SERIOUSNESS ONLY COMMENCES WHEN THE PROPER INTERROGATIVE MARK IS SET UP THE FATE OF THE SOUL CHANGES THE HOURHAND MOVES AND TRAGEDY BEGINS ALTHOUGH THE FIGURE OF ZARATHUSTRA AND A LARGE NUMBER OF THE LEADING THOUGHTS IN THIS WORK HAD APPEARED MUCH EARLIER IN THE DREAMS AND WRITINGS OF THE AUTHOR THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA DID NOT ACTUALLY COME INTO BEING UNTIL THE MONTH OF AUGUST IN SILS MARIA AND IT WAS THE IDEA OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS WHICH FINALLY INDUCED MY BROTHER TO SET FORTH HIS NEW VIEWS IN POETIC LANGUAGE IN REGARD TO HIS FIRST CONCEPTION OF THIS IDEA HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH ECCE HOMO WRITTEN IN THE AUTUMN OF CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA OF MY WORKNAMELY THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGSTHIS HIGHEST OF ALL POSSIBLE FORMULAE OF A YEASAYING PHILOSOPHY FIRST OCCURRED TO ME IN AUGUST I MADE A NOTE OF THE THOUGHT ON A SHEET OF PAPER WITH THE POSTSCRIPT FEET BEYOND MEN AND TIME THAT DAY I HAPPENED TO BE WANDERING THROUGH THE WOODS ALONGSIDE OF THE LAKE OF SILVAPLANA AND I HALTED BESIDE A HUGE PYRAMIDAL AND TOWERING ROCK NOT FAR FROM SURLEI IT WAS THEN THAT THE THOUGHT STRUCK ME LOOKING BACK NOW I FIND THAT EXACTLY TWO MONTHS PREVIOUS TO THIS INSPIRATION I HAD HAD AN OMEN OF ITS COMING IN THE FORM OF A SUDDEN AND DECISIVE ALTERATION IN MY TASTESMORE PARTICULARLY IN MUSIC IT WOULD EVEN BE POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER ALL ZARATHUSTRA AS A MUSICAL COMPOSITION AT ALL EVENTS A VERY NECESSARY CONDITION IN ITS PRODUCTION WAS A RENAISSANCE IN MYSELF OF THE ART OF HEARING IN A SMALL MOUNTAIN RESORT RECOARO NEAR VICENZA WHERE I SPENT THE SPRING OF I AND MY FRIEND AND MAESTRO PETER GASTALSO ONE WHO HAD BEEN BORN AGAINDISCOVERED THAT THE PHOENIX MUSIC THAT HOVERED OVER US WORE LIGHTER AND BRIGHTER PLUMES THAN IT HAD DONE THERETOFORE DURING THE MONTH OF AUGUST MY BROTHER RESOLVED TO REVEAL THE TEACHING OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN DITHYRAMBIC AND PSALMODIC FORM THROUGH THE MOUTH OF ZARATHUSTRA AMONG THE NOTES OF THIS PERIOD WE FOUND A PAGE ON WHICH IS WRITTEN THE FIRST DEFINITE PLAN OF THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA MIDDAY AND ETERNITY GUIDEPOSTS TO A NEW WAY OF LIVING BENEATH THIS IS WRITTEN ZARATHUSTRA BORN ON LAKE URMI LEFT HIS HOME IN HIS THIRTIETH YEAR WENT INTO THE PROVINCE OF ARIA AND DURING TEN YEARS OF SOLITUDE IN THE MOUNTAINS COMPOSED THE ZENDAVESTA THE SUN OF KNOWLEDGE STANDS ONCE MORE AT MIDDAY AND THE SERPENT OF ETERNITY LIES COILED IN ITS LIGHT IT IS YOUR TIME YE MIDDAY BRETHREN IN THAT SUMMER OF MY BROTHER AFTER MANY YEARS OF STEADILY DECLINING HEALTH BEGAN AT LAST TO RALLY AND IT IS TO THIS FIRST GUSH OF THE RECOVERY OF HIS ONCE SPLENDID BODILY CONDITION THAT WE OWE NOT ONLY THE GAY SCIENCE WHICH IN ITS MOOD MAY BE REGARDED AS A PRELUDE TO ZARATHUSTRA BUT ALSO ZARATHUSTRA ITSELF JUST AS HE WAS BEGINNING TO RECUPERATE HIS HEALTH HOWEVER AN UNKIND DESTINY BROUGHT HIM A NUMBER OF MOST PAINFUL PERSONAL EXPERIENCES HIS FRIENDS CAUSED HIM MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS WHICH WERE THE MORE BITTER TO HIM INASMUCH AS HE REGARDED FRIENDSHIP AS SUCH A SACRED INSTITUTION AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE REALISED THE WHOLE HORROR OF THAT LONELINESS TO WHICH PERHAPS ALL GREATNESS IS CONDEMNED BUT TO BE FORSAKEN IS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM DELIBERATELY CHOOSING BLESSED LONELINESS HOW HE LONGED IN THOSE DAYS FOR THE IDEAL FRIEND WHO WOULD THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND HIM TO WHOM HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY ALL AND WHOM HE IMAGINED HE HAD FOUND AT VARIOUS PERIODS IN HIS LIFE FROM HIS EARLIEST YOUTH ONWARDS NOW HOWEVER THAT THE WAY HE HAD CHOSEN GREW EVER MORE PERILOUS AND STEEP HE FOUND NOBODY WHO COULD FOLLOW HIM HE THEREFORE CREATED A PERFECT FRIEND FOR HIMSELF IN THE IDEAL FORM OF A MAJESTIC PHILOSOPHER AND MADE THIS CREATION THE PREACHER OF HIS GOSPEL TO THE WORLD WHETHER MY BROTHER WOULD EVER HAVE WRITTEN THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA ACCORDING TO THE FIRST PLAN SKETCHED IN THE SUMMER OF IF HE HAD NOT HAD THE DISAPPOINTMENTS ALREADY REFERRED TO IS NOW AN IDLE QUESTION BUT PERHAPS WHERE ZARATHUSTRA IS CONCERNED WE MAY ALSO SAY WITH MASTER ECKHARDT THE FLEETEST BEAST TO BEAR YOU TO PERFECTION IS SUFFERING MY BROTHER WRITES AS FOLLOWS ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRST PART OF ZARATHUSTRAIN THE WINTER OF I WAS LIVING ON THE CHARMING LITTLE GULF OF RAPALLO NOT FAR FROM GENOA AND BETWEEN CHIAVARI AND CAPE PORTO FINO MY HEALTH WAS NOT VERY GOOD THE WINTER WAS COLD AND EXCEPTIONALLY RAINY AND THE SMALL INN IN WHICH I LIVED WAS SO CLOSE TO THE WATER THAT AT NIGHT MY SLEEP WOULD BE DISTURBED IF THE SEA WERE HIGH THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SURELY THE VERY REVERSE OF FAVOURABLE AND YET IN SPITE OF IT ALL AND AS IF IN DEMONSTRATION OF MY BELIEF THAT EVERYTHING DECISIVE COMES TO LIFE IN SPITE OF EVERY OBSTACLE IT WAS PRECISELY DURING THIS WINTER AND IN THE MIDST OF THESE UNFAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MY ZARATHUSTRA ORIGINATED IN THE MORNING I USED TO START OUT IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION UP THE GLORIOUS ROAD TO ZOAGLI WHICH RISES ALOFT THROUGH A FOREST OF PINES AND GIVES ONE A VIEW FAR OUT INTO THE SEA IN THE AFTERNOON AS OFTEN AS MY HEALTH PERMITTED I WALKED ROUND THE WHOLE BAY FROM SANTA MARGHERITA TO BEYOND PORTO FINO THIS SPOT WAS ALL THE MORE INTERESTING TO ME INASMUCH AS IT WAS SO DEARLY LOVED BY THE EMPEROR FREDERICK III IN THE AUTUMN OF I CHANCED TO BE THERE AGAIN WHEN HE WAS REVISITING THIS SMALL FORGOTTEN WORLD OF HAPPINESS FOR THE LAST TIME IT WAS ON THESE TWO ROADS THAT ALL ZARATHUSTRA CAME TO ME ABOVE ALL ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF AS A TYPEI OUGHT RATHER TO SAY THAT IT WAS ON THESE WALKS THAT THESE IDEAS WAYLAID ME THE FIRST PART OF ZARATHUSTRA WAS WRITTEN IN ABOUT TEN DAYSTHAT IS TO SAY FROM THE BEGINNING TO ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY THE LAST LINES WERE WRITTEN PRECISELY IN THE HALLOWED HOUR WHEN RICHARD WAGNER GAVE UP THE GHOST IN VENICE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE TEN DAYS OCCUPIED IN COMPOSING THE FIRST PART OF THIS BOOK MY BROTHER OFTEN REFERRED TO THIS WINTER AS THE HARDEST AND SICKLIEST HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED HE DID NOT HOWEVER MEAN THEREBY THAT HIS FORMER DISORDERS WERE TROUBLING HIM BUT THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FROM A SEVERE ATTACK OF INFLUENZA WHICH HE HAD CAUGHT IN SANTA MARGHERITA AND WHICH TORMENTED HIM FOR SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN GENOA AS A MATTER OF FACT HOWEVER WHAT HE COMPLAINED OF MOST WAS HIS SPIRITUAL CONDITIONTHAT INDESCRIBABLE FORSAKENNESSTO WHICH HE GIVES SUCH HEARTRENDING EXPRESSION IN ZARATHUSTRA EVEN THE RECEPTION WHICH THE FIRST PART MET WITH AT THE HANDS OF FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WAS EXTREMELY DISHEARTENING FOR ALMOST ALL THOSE TO WHOM HE PRESENTED COPIES OF THE WORK MISUNDERSTOOD IT I FOUND NO ONE RIPE FOR MANY OF MY THOUGHTS THE CASE OF ZARATHUSTRA PROVES THAT ONE CAN SPEAK WITH THE UTMOST CLEARNESS AND YET NOT BE HEARD BY ANY ONE MY BROTHER WAS VERY MUCH DISCOURAGED BY THE FEEBLENESS OF THE RESPONSE HE WAS GIVEN AND AS HE WAS STRIVING JUST THEN TO GIVE UP THE PRACTICE OF TAKING HYDRATE OF CHLORALA DRUG HE HAD BEGUN TO TAKE WHILE ILL WITH INFLUENZATHE FOLLOWING SPRING SPENT IN ROME WAS A SOMEWHAT GLOOMY ONE FOR HIM HE WRITES ABOUT IT AS FOLLOWSI SPENT A MELANCHOLY SPRING IN ROME WHERE I ONLY JUST MANAGED TO LIVEAND THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER THIS CITY WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY UNSUITED TO THE POETAUTHOR OF ZARATHUSTRA AND FOR THE CHOICE OF WHICH I WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE MADE ME INORDINATELY MISERABLE I TRIED TO LEAVE IT I WANTED TO GO TO AQUILATHE OPPOSITE OF ROME IN EVERY RESPECT AND ACTUALLY FOUNDED IN A SPIRIT OF ENMITY TOWARDS THAT CITY JUST AS I ALSO SHALL FOUND A CITY SOME DAY AS A MEMENTO OF AN ATHEIST AND GENUINE ENEMY OF THE CHURCHA PERSON VERY CLOSELY RELATED TO METHE GREAT HOHENSTAUFEN THE EMPEROR FREDERICK II BUT FATE LAY BEHIND IT ALL I HAD TO RETURN AGAIN TO ROME IN THE END I WAS OBLIGED TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE PIAZZA BARBERINI AFTER I HAD EXERTED MYSELF IN VAIN TO FIND AN ANTICHRISTIAN QUARTER I FEAR THAT ON ONE OCCASION TO AVOID BAD SMELLS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I ACTUALLY INQUIRED AT THE PALAZZO DEL QUIRINALE WHETHER THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE A QUIET ROOM FOR A PHILOSOPHER IN A CHAMBER HIGH ABOVE THE PIAZZA JUST MENTIONED FROM WHICH ONE OBTAINED A GENERAL VIEW OF ROME AND COULD HEAR THE FOUNTAINS PLASHING FAR BELOW THE LONELIEST OF ALL SONGS WAS COMPOSEDTHE NIGHTSONG ABOUT THIS TIME I WAS OBSESSED BY AN UNSPEAKABLY SAD MELODY THE REFRAIN OF WHICH I RECOGNISED IN THE WORDS DEAD THROUGH IMMORTALITY WE REMAINED SOMEWHAT TOO LONG IN ROME THAT SPRING AND WHAT WITH THE EFFECT OF THE INCREASING HEAT AND THE DISCOURAGING CIRCUMSTANCES ALREADY DESCRIBED MY BROTHER RESOLVED NOT TO WRITE ANY MORE OR IN ANY CASE NOT TO PROCEED WITH ZARATHUSTRA ALTHOUGH I OFFERED TO RELIEVE HIM OF ALL TROUBLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROOFS AND THE PUBLISHER WHEN HOWEVER WE RETURNED TO SWITZERLAND TOWARDS THE END OF JUNE AND HE FOUND HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE FAMILIAR AND EXHILARATING AIR OF THE MOUNTAINS ALL HIS JOYOUS CREATIVE POWERS REVIVED AND IN A NOTE TO ME ANNOUNCING THE DISPATCH OF SOME MANUSCRIPT HE WROTE AS FOLLOWS I HAVE ENGAGED A PLACE HERE FOR THREE MONTHS FORSOOTH I AM THE GREATEST FOOL TO ALLOW MY COURAGE TO BE SAPPED FROM ME BY THE CLIMATE OF ITALY NOW AND AGAIN I AM TROUBLED BY THE THOUGHT WHAT NEXT MY FUTURE IS THE DARKEST THING IN THE WORLD TO ME BUT AS THERE STILL REMAINS A GREAT DEAL FOR ME TO DO I SUPPOSE I OUGHT RATHER TO THINK OF DOING THIS THAN OF MY FUTURE AND LEAVE THE REST TO THEE AND THE GODS THE SECOND PART OF ZARATHUSTRA WAS WRITTEN BETWEEN THE TH OF JUNE AND THE TH JULY THIS SUMMER FINDING MYSELF ONCE MORE IN THE SACRED PLACE WHERE THE FIRST THOUGHT OF ZARATHUSTRA FLASHED ACROSS MY MIND I CONCEIVED THE SECOND PART TEN DAYS SUFFICED NEITHER FOR THE SECOND THE FIRST NOR THE THIRD PART HAVE I REQUIRED A DAY LONGER HE OFTEN USED TO SPEAK OF THE ECSTATIC MOOD IN WHICH HE WROTE ZARATHUSTRA HOW IN HIS WALKS OVER HILL AND DALE THE IDEAS WOULD CROWD INTO HIS MIND AND HOW HE WOULD NOTE THEM DOWN HASTILY IN A NOTEBOOK FROM WHICH HE WOULD TRANSCRIBE THEM ON HIS RETURN SOMETIMES WORKING TILL MIDNIGHT HE SAYS IN A LETTER TO ME YOU CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE VEHEMENCE OF SUCH COMPOSITION AND IN ECCE HOMO AUTUMN HE DESCRIBES AS FOLLOWS WITH PASSIONATE ENTHUSIASM THE INCOMPARABLE MOOD IN WHICH HE CREATED ZARATHUSTRA HAS ANY ONE AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ANY DISTINCT NOTION OF WHAT POETS OF A STRONGER AGE UNDERSTOOD BY THE WORD INSPIRATION IF NOT I WILL DESCRIBE IT IF ONE HAD THE SMALLEST VESTIGE OF SUPERSTITION IN ONE IT WOULD HARDLY BE POSSIBLE TO SET ASIDE COMPLETELY THE IDEA THAT ONE IS THE MERE INCARNATION MOUTHPIECE OR MEDIUM OF AN ALMIGHTY POWER THE IDEA OF REVELATION IN THE SENSE THAT SOMETHING BECOMES SUDDENLY VISIBLE AND AUDIBLE WITH INDESCRIBABLE CERTAINTY AND ACCURACY WHICH PROFOUNDLY CONVULSES AND UPSETS ONEDESCRIBES SIMPLY THE MATTER OF FACT ONE HEARSONE DOES NOT SEEK ONE TAKESONE DOES NOT ASK WHO GIVES A THOUGHT SUDDENLY FLASHES UP LIKE LIGHTNING IT COMES WITH NECESSITY UNHESITATINGLYI HAVE NEVER HAD ANY CHOICE IN THE MATTER THERE IS AN ECSTASY SUCH THAT THE IMMENSE STRAIN OF IT IS SOMETIMES RELAXED BY A FLOOD OF TEARS ALONG WITH WHICH ONES STEPS EITHER RUSH OR INVOLUNTARILY LAG ALTERNATELY THERE IS THE FEELING THAT ONE IS COMPLETELY OUT OF HAND WITH THE VERY DISTINCT CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN ENDLESS NUMBER OF FINE THRILLS AND QUIVERINGS TO THE VERY TOESTHERE IS A DEPTH OF HAPPINESS IN WHICH THE PAINFULLEST AND GLOOMIEST DO NOT OPERATE AS ANTITHESES BUT AS CONDITIONED AS DEMANDED IN THE SENSE OF NECESSARY SHADES OF COLOUR IN SUCH AN OVERFLOW OF LIGHT THERE IS AN INSTINCT FOR RHYTHMIC RELATIONS WHICH EMBRACES WIDE AREAS OF FORMS LENGTH THE NEED OF A WIDEEMBRACING RHYTHM IS ALMOST THE MEASURE OF THE FORCE OF AN INSPIRATION A SORT OF COUNTERPART TO ITS PRESSURE AND TENSION EVERYTHING HAPPENS QUITE INVOLUNTARILY AS IF IN A TEMPESTUOUS OUTBURST OF FREEDOM OF ABSOLUTENESS OF POWER AND DIVINITY THE INVOLUNTARINESS OF THE FIGURES AND SIMILES IS THE MOST REMARKABLE THING ONE LOSES ALL PERCEPTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES THE FIGURE AND WHAT CONSTITUTES THE SIMILE EVERYTHING SEEMS TO PRESENT ITSELF AS THE READIEST THE CORRECTEST AND THE SIMPLEST MEANS OF EXPRESSION IT ACTUALLY SEEMS TO USE ONE OF ZARATHUSTRAS OWN PHRASES AS IF ALL THINGS CAME UNTO ONE AND WOULD FAIN BE SIMILES HERE DO ALL THINGS COME CARESSINGLY TO THY TALK AND FLATTER THEE FOR THEY WANT TO RIDE UPON THY BACK ON EVERY SIMILE DOST THOU HERE RIDE TO EVERY TRUTH HERE FLY OPEN UNTO THEE ALL BEINGS WORDS AND WORDCABINETS HERE ALL BEING WANTETH TO BECOME WORDS HERE ALL BECOMING WANTETH TO LEARN OF THEE HOW TO TALK THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE OF INSPIRATION I DO NOT DOUBT BUT THAT ONE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN ORDER TO FIND SOME ONE WHO COULD SAY TO ME IT IS MINE ALSO IN THE AUTUMN OF MY BROTHER LEFT THE ENGADINE FOR GERMANY AND STAYED THERE A FEW WEEKS IN THE FOLLOWING WINTER AFTER WANDERING SOMEWHAT ERRATICALLY THROUGH STRESA GENOA AND SPEZIA HE LANDED IN NICE WHERE THE CLIMATE SO HAPPILY PROMOTED HIS CREATIVE POWERS THAT HE WROTE THE THIRD PART OF ZARATHUSTRA IN THE WINTER BENEATH THE HALCYON SKY OF NICE WHICH THEN LOOKED DOWN UPON ME FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I FOUND THE THIRD ZARATHUSTRAAND CAME TO THE END OF MY TASK THE WHOLE HAVING OCCUPIED ME SCARCELY A YEAR MANY HIDDEN CORNERS AND HEIGHTS IN THE LANDSCAPES ROUND ABOUT NICE ARE HALLOWED TO ME BY UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS THAT DECISIVE CHAPTER ENTITLED OLD AND NEW TABLES WAS COMPOSED IN THE VERY DIFFICULT ASCENT FROM THE STATION TO EZATHAT WONDERFUL MOORISH VILLAGE IN THE ROCKS MY MOST CREATIVE MOMENTS WERE ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY UNUSUAL MUSCULAR ACTIVITY THE BODY IS INSPIRED LET US WAIVE THE QUESTION OF THE SOUL I MIGHT OFTEN HAVE BEEN SEEN DANCING IN THOSE DAYS WITHOUT A SUGGESTION OF FATIGUE I COULD THEN WALK FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS ON END AMONG THE HILLS I SLEPT WELL AND LAUGHED WELLI WAS PERFECTLY ROBUST AND PATIENT AS WE HAVE SEEN EACH OF THE THREE PARTS OF ZARATHUSTRA WAS WRITTEN AFTER A MORE OR LESS SHORT PERIOD OF PREPARATION IN ABOUT TEN DAYS THE COMPOSITION OF THE FOURTH PART ALONE WAS BROKEN BY OCCASIONAL INTERRUPTIONS THE FIRST NOTES RELATING TO THIS PART WERE WRITTEN WHILE HE AND I WERE STAYING TOGETHER IN ZURICH IN SEPTEMBER IN THE FOLLOWING NOVEMBER WHILE STAYING AT MENTONE HE BEGAN TO ELABORATE THESE NOTES AND AFTER A LONG PAUSE FINISHED THE MANUSCRIPT AT NICE BETWEEN THE END OF JANUARY AND THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY MY BROTHER THEN CALLED THIS PART THE FOURTH AND LAST BUT EVEN BEFORE AND SHORTLY AFTER IT HAD BEEN PRIVATELY PRINTED HE WROTE TO ME SAYING THAT HE STILL INTENDED WRITING A FIFTH AND SIXTH PART AND NOTES RELATING TO THESE PARTS ARE NOW IN MY POSSESSION THIS FOURTH PART THE ORIGINAL MS OF WHICH CONTAINS THIS NOTE ONLY FOR MY FRIENDS NOT FOR THE PUBLIC IS WRITTEN IN A PARTICULARLY PERSONAL SPIRIT AND THOSE FEW TO WHOM HE PRESENTED A COPY OF IT HE PLEDGED TO THE STRICTEST SECRECY CONCERNING ITS CONTENTS HE OFTEN THOUGHT OF MAKING THIS FOURTH PART PUBLIC ALSO BUT DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT CONSIDERABLY ALTERING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF IT AT ALL EVENTS HE RESOLVED TO DISTRIBUTE THIS MANUSCRIPT PRODUCTION OF WHICH ONLY FORTY COPIES WERE PRINTED ONLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAD PROVED THEMSELVES WORTHY OF IT AND IT SPEAKS ELOQUENTLY OF HIS UTTER LONELINESS AND NEED OF SYMPATHY IN THOSE DAYS THAT HE HAD OCCASION TO PRESENT ONLY SEVEN COPIES OF HIS BOOK ACCORDING TO THIS RESOLUTION ALREADY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY I HINTED AT THE REASONS WHICH LED MY BROTHER TO SELECT A PERSIAN AS THE INCARNATION OF HIS IDEAL OF THE MAJESTIC PHILOSOPHER HIS REASONS HOWEVER FOR CHOOSING ZARATHUSTRA OF ALL OTHERS TO BE HIS MOUTHPIECE HE GIVES US IN THE FOLLOWING WORDSPEOPLE HAVE NEVER ASKED ME AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE WHAT THE NAME ZARATHUSTRA PRECISELY MEANS IN MY MOUTH IN THE MOUTH OF THE FIRST IMMORALIST FOR WHAT DISTINGUISHES THAT PHILOSOPHER FROM ALL OTHERS IN THE PAST IS THE VERY FACT THAT HE WAS EXACTLY THE REVERSE OF AN IMMORALIST ZARATHUSTRA WAS THE FIRST TO SEE IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL THE ESSENTIAL WHEEL IN THE WORKING OF THINGS THE TRANSLATION OF MORALITY INTO THE METAPHYSICAL AS FORCE CAUSE END IN ITSELF WAS HIS WORK BUT THE VERY QUESTION SUGGESTS ITS OWN ANSWER ZARATHUSTRA CREATED THE MOST PORTENTOUS ERROR MORALITY CONSEQUENTLY HE SHOULD ALSO BE THE FIRST TO PERCEIVE THAT ERROR NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE HAS HAD LONGER AND GREATER EXPERIENCE OF THE SUBJECT THAN ANY OTHER THINKERALL HISTORY IS THE EXPERIMENTAL REFUTATION OF THE THEORY OF THE SOCALLED MORAL ORDER OF THINGSTHE MORE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT ZARATHUSTRA WAS MORE TRUTHFUL THAN ANY OTHER THINKER IN HIS TEACHING ALONE DO WE MEET WITH TRUTHFULNESS UPHELD AS THE HIGHEST VIRTUEIE THE REVERSE OF THE COWARDICE OF THE IDEALIST WHO FLEES FROM REALITY ZARATHUSTRA HAD MORE COURAGE IN HIS BODY THAN ANY OTHER THINKER BEFORE OR AFTER HIM TO TELL THE TRUTH AND TO AIM STRAIGHT THAT IS THE FIRST PERSIAN VIRTUE AM I UNDERSTOOD THE OVERCOMING OF MORALITY THROUGH ITSELFTHROUGH TRUTHFULNESS THE OVERCOMING OF THE MORALIST THROUGH HIS OPPOSITETHROUGH ME THAT IS WHAT THE NAME ZARATHUSTRA MEANS IN MY MOUTH ELIZABETH FORSTERNIETZSCHE NIETZSCHE ARCHIVES WEIMAR DECEMBER THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA FIRST PART ZARATHUSTRAS DISCOURSES ZARATHUSTRAS PROLOGUE WHEN ZARATHUSTRA WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD HE LEFT HIS HOME AND THE LAKE OF HIS HOME AND WENT INTO THE MOUNTAINS THERE HE ENJOYED HIS SPIRIT AND SOLITUDE AND FOR TEN YEARS DID NOT WEARY OF IT BUT AT LAST HIS HEART CHANGEDAND RISING ONE MORNING WITH THE ROSY DAWN HE WENT BEFORE THE SUN AND SPAKE THUS UNTO IT THOU GREAT STAR WHAT WOULD BE THY HAPPINESS IF THOU HADST NOT THOSE FOR WHOM THOU SHINEST FOR TEN YEARS HAST THOU CLIMBED HITHER UNTO

ZARATHUSTRAS DOWNGOING ZARATHUSTRA WENT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ALONE NO ONE MEETING HIM WHEN HE ENTERED THE FOREST HOWEVER THERE SUDDENLY STOOD BEFORE HIM AN OLD MAN WHO HAD LEFT HIS HOLY COT TO SEEK ROOTS

LOADBEARING SPIRIT THAT I MAY TAKE IT UPON ME AND REJOICE IN MY STRENGTH IS IT NOT THIS TO HUMILIATE ONESELF IN ORDER TO MORTIFY ONES PRIDE TO EXHIBIT ONES FOLLY IN ORDER TO MOCK AT ONES WISDOM OR IS IT THIS TO DESERT OUR CAUSE WHEN IT CELEBRATETH ITS TRIUMPH TO ASCEND HIGH MOUNTAINS TO TEMPT THE TEMPTER OR IS IT THIS TO FEED ON THE ACORNS AND GRASS OF KNOWLEDGE AND FOR THE SAKE OF TRUTH TO SUFFER HUNGER OF SOUL OR IS IT THIS TO BE SICK AND DISMISS COMFORTERS AND MAKE FRIENDS OF THE DEAF WHO NEVER HEAR THY REQUESTS OR IS IT THIS TO GO INTO FOUL WATER WHEN IT IS THE WATER OF TRUTH AND NOT DISCLAIM COLD FROGS AND HOT TOADS OR IS IT THIS TO LOVE THOSE WHO DESPISE US AND GIVE ONES HAND TO THE PHANTOM WHEN IT IS GOING TO FRIGHTEN US ALL THESE HEAVIEST THINGS THE LOADBEARING SPIRIT TAKETH UPON ITSELF AND LIKE THE CAMEL WHICH WHEN LADEN HASTENETH INTO THE WILDERNESS SO HASTENETH THE SPIRIT INTO ITS WILDERNESS BUT IN THE LONELIEST WILDERNESS HAPPENETH THE SECOND METAMORPHOSIS HERE THE

OUT OF THE POETS THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA XL GREAT EVENTS THERE IS AN ISLE IN THE SEANOT FAR FROM THE HAPPY ISLES OF ZARATHUSTRAON WHICH A VOLCANO EVER SMOKETH OF WHICH ISLE THE PEOPLE AND ESPECIALLY THE OLD WOMEN AMONGST THEM SAY THAT IT IS PLACED AS A ROCK BEFORE THE GATE OF THE NETHERWORLD BUT THAT THROUGH THE VOLCANO ITSELF THE NARROW WAY LEADETH DOWNWARDS WHICH CONDUCTETH TO THIS GATE NOW ABOUT THE TIME THAT ZARATHUSTRA SOJOURNED ON THE HAPPY ISLES IT HAPPENED THAT A SHIP ANCHORED AT THE ISLE ON WHICH STANDETH THE SMOKING MOUNTAIN AND THE CREW WENT ASHORE TO SHOOT RABBITS ABOUT THE NOONTIDE HOUR HOWEVER WHEN THE CAPTAIN AND HIS MEN WERE TOGETHER AGAIN THEY SAW SUDDENLY A MAN COMING TOWARDS THEM THROUGH THE AIR AND A VOICE SAID DISTINCTLY IT IS TIME IT IS THE HIGHEST TIME BUT WHEN THE FIGURE WAS NEAREST TO THEM IT FLEW PAST QUICKLY HOWEVER LIKE A SHADOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOLCANO THEN DID THEY RECOGNISE WITH THE GREATEST SURPRISE THAT IT WAS ZARATHUSTRA FOR THEY HAD ALL SEEN HIM BEFORE EXCEPT THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF AND THEY LOVED HIM AS THE PEOPLE LOVE IN SUCH WISE THAT LOVE AND AWE WERE COMBINED IN EQUAL DEGREE BEHOLD SAID THE OLD HELMSMAN THERE GOETH ZARATHUSTRA TO HELL ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT THESE SAILORS LANDED ON THE FIREISLE THERE WAS A RUMOUR THAT ZARATHUSTRA HAD DISAPPEARED AND WHEN HIS FRIENDS WERE ASKED ABOUT IT THEY SAID THAT HE HAD GONE ON BOARD A SHIP BY NIGHT WITHOUT SAYING WHITHER HE WAS GOING THUS THERE AROSE SOME UNEASINESS AFTER THREE DAYS HOWEVER THERE CAME THE STORY OF THE SHIPS CREW IN ADDITION TO THIS UNEASINESSAND THEN DID ALL THE PEOPLE SAY THAT THE DEVIL HAD TAKEN ZARATHUSTRA HIS DISCIPLES LAUGHED SURE ENOUGH AT THIS TALK AND ONE OF THEM SAID EVEN SOONER WOULD I BELIEVE THAT ZARATHUSTRA HATH TAKEN THE DEVIL BUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEARTS THEY WERE ALL FULL OF ANXIETY AND LONGING SO THEIR JOY WAS GREAT WHEN ON THE FIFTH DAY ZARATHUSTRA APPEARED AMONGST THEM AND THIS IS THE ACCOUNT OF ZARATHUSTRAS INTERVIEW WITH THE

OTHERS THEN THRONGED AROUND ZARATHUSTRA GRASPED HIM BY THE HANDS AND TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM TO LEAVE HIS BED AND HIS SADNESS AND RETURN UNTO THEM ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER SAT UPRIGHT ON HIS COUCH WITH AN ABSENT LOOK LIKE ONE RETURNING FROM LONG FOREIGN SOJOURN DID HE LOOK ON HIS DISCIPLES AND EXAMINED THEIR FEATURES BUT STILL HE KNEW THEM NOT WHEN HOWEVER THEY RAISED HIM AND SET HIM UPON HIS FEET BEHOLD ALL ON A SUDDEN HIS EYE CHANGED HE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED STROKED HIS BEARD AND SAID WITH A STRONG VOICE WELL THIS HATH JUST ITS TIME BUT SEE TO IT MY DISCIPLES THAT WE HAVE A

SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA THEN DID HE GAZE LONG INTO THE FACE OF THE DISCIPLE WHO HAD BEEN THE DREAMINTERPRETER AND SHOOK HIS HEAD XLII REDEMPTION WHEN ZARATHUSTRA WENT ONE DAY OVER THE GREAT BRIDGE THEN DID THE CRIPPLES AND BEGGARS SURROUND HIM AND A HUNCHBACK SPAKE THUS UNTO HIM BEHOLD ZARATHUSTRA EVEN THE PEOPLE LEARN FROM THEE AND ACQUIRE FAITH IN THY TEACHING BUT FOR THEM TO BELIEVE FULLY IN THEE ONE THING IS STILL NEEDFULTHOU MUST FIRST OF ALL CONVINCE US CRIPPLES HERE HAST THOU NOW A FINE SELECTION AND VERILY AN OPPORTUNITY WITH MORE THAN ONE FORELOCK THE BLIND CANST THOU HEAL AND MAKE THE LAME RUN AND FROM HIM WHO HATH TOO MUCH BEHIND COULDST THOU WELL ALSO TAKE AWAY A LITTLETHAT I THINK WOULD BE THE RIGHT METHOD TO MAKE THE CRIPPLES BELIEVE IN ZARATHUSTRA ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER ANSWERED THUS UNTO HIM WHO SO SPAKE WHEN ONE TAKETH HIS HUMP FROM THE HUNCHBACK THEN DOTH ONE TAKE FROM HIM HIS SPIRITSO DO THE PEOPLE TEACH AND WHEN ONE GIVETH THE BLIND MAN EYES THEN DOTH HE SEE TOO MANY BAD THINGS ON THE EARTH SO THAT HE CURSETH HIM WHO HEALED HIM HE HOWEVER WHO MAKETH THE LAME MAN RUN INFLICTETH UPON HIM THE GREATEST INJURY FOR HARDLY CAN HE RUN WHEN HIS VICES RUN AWAY WITH HIMSO DO THE PEOPLE TEACH CONCERNING CRIPPLES AND WHY SHOULD NOT ZARATHUSTRA ALSO LEARN FROM THE PEOPLE WHEN THE PEOPLE LEARN FROM ZARATHUSTRA IT IS HOWEVER THE SMALLEST THING UNTO ME SINCE I HAVE BEEN AMONGST MEN TO SEE ONE PERSON LACKING AN EYE ANOTHER AN EAR AND A THIRD A LEG AND THAT OTHERS HAVE LOST THE TONGUE OR THE NOSE OR THE HEAD I SEE AND HAVE SEEN WORSE THINGS AND DIVERS THINGS SO HIDEOUS THAT I SHOULD NEITHER LIKE TO SPEAK OF ALL MATTERS NOR EVEN KEEP SILENT ABOUT SOME OF THEM NAMELY MEN WHO LACK EVERYTHING EXCEPT THAT THEY HAVE TOO MUCH OF ONE THINGMEN WHO ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A BIG EYE OR A BIG MOUTH OR A BIG BELLY OR SOMETHING ELSE BIGREVERSED CRIPPLES I CALL SUCH MEN AND WHEN I CAME OUT OF MY SOLITUDE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME PASSED OVER THIS BRIDGE THEN I COULD NOT TRUST MINE EYES BUT LOOKED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SAID AT LAST THAT IS AN EAR AN EAR AS BIG AS A MAN I LOOKED STILL MORE ATTENTIVELYAND ACTUALLY THERE DID MOVE UNDER THE EAR SOMETHING THAT WAS PITIABLY SMALL AND POOR AND SLIM AND IN TRUTH THIS IMMENSE EAR WAS PERCHED ON A SMALL THIN STALKTHE STALK HOWEVER WAS A MAN A PERSON PUTTING A GLASS TO HIS EYES COULD EVEN RECOGNISE FURTHER A SMALL ENVIOUS COUNTENANCE AND ALSO THAT A BLOATED SOULLET DANGLED AT THE STALK THE PEOPLE TOLD ME HOWEVER THAT THE BIG EAR WAS NOT ONLY A MAN BUT A GREAT MAN A GENIUS BUT I NEVER BELIEVED IN THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SPAKE OF GREAT MENAND I HOLD TO MY BELIEF THAT IT WAS A REVERSED CRIPPLE WHO HAD TOO LITTLE OF EVERYTHING AND TOO MUCH OF ONE THING WHEN ZARATHUSTRA HAD SPOKEN THUS UNTO THE HUNCHBACK AND UNTO THOSE OF WHOM THE HUNCHBACK WAS THE MOUTHPIECE AND ADVOCATE THEN DID HE TURN TO HIS DISCIPLES IN PROFOUND DEJECTION AND SAID VERILY MY FRIENDS I WALK AMONGST MEN AS AMONGST THE FRAGMENTS AND LIMBS OF HUMAN BEINGS THIS IS THE TERRIBLE THING TO MINE EYE THAT I FIND MAN BROKEN UP AND SCATTERED ABOUT AS ON A BATTLE AND BUTCHERGROUND AND WHEN MINE EYE FLEETH FROM THE PRESENT TO THE BYGONE IT FINDETH EVER THE SAME FRAGMENTS AND LIMBS AND FEARFUL CHANCESBUT NO MEN THE PRESENT AND THE BYGONE UPON EARTHAH MY FRIENDSTHAT IS MY MOST UNBEARABLE TROUBLE AND I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO LIVE IF I WERE NOT A SEER OF WHAT IS TO COME A SEER A PURPOSER A CREATOR A FUTURE ITSELF AND A BRIDGE TO THE FUTUREAND ALAS ALSO AS IT WERE A CRIPPLE ON THIS BRIDGE ALL THAT IS ZARATHUSTRA AND YE ALSO ASKED YOURSELVES OFTEN WHO IS ZARATHUSTRA TO US WHAT SHALL HE BE CALLED BY US AND LIKE ME DID YE GIVE YOURSELVES QUESTIONS FOR ANSWERS IS HE A PROMISER OR A FULFILLER A CONQUEROR OR AN INHERITOR A HARVEST OR A PLOUGHSHARE A PHYSICIAN OR A HEALED ONE IS HE A POET OR A GENUINE ONE AN EMANCIPATOR OR A SUBJUGATOR A GOOD ONE OR AN EVIL ONE I WALK AMONGST MEN AS THE FRAGMENTS OF THE FUTURE THAT FUTURE WHICH I CONTEMPLATE AND IT IS ALL MY POETISATION AND ASPIRATION TO COMPOSE AND COLLECT INTO UNITY WHAT IS FRAGMENT AND RIDDLE AND FEARFUL CHANCE AND HOW COULD I ENDURE TO BE A MAN IF MAN WERE NOT ALSO THE COMPOSER AND RIDDLEREADER AND REDEEMER OF CHANCE TO REDEEM WHAT IS PAST AND TO TRANSFORM EVERY IT WAS INTO THUS WOULD I HAVE ITTHAT ONLY DO I CALL REDEMPTION WILLSO IS THE EMANCIPATOR AND JOYBRINGER CALLED THUS HAVE I TAUGHT YOU MY FRIENDS BUT NOW LEARN THIS LIKEWISE THE WILL ITSELF IS STILL A PRISONER WILLING EMANCIPATETH BUT WHAT IS THAT CALLED WHICH STILL PUTTETH THE EMANCIPATOR IN CHAINS IT WAS THUS IS THE WILLS

TAKE PLACE WHO HATH TAUGHT IT ALSO TO WILL BACKWARDS BUT AT THIS POINT IN HIS DISCOURSE IT CHANCED THAT ZARATHUSTRA SUDDENLY PAUSED AND LOOKED LIKE A PERSON IN THE GREATEST ALARM WITH TERROR IN HIS EYES DID HE GAZE ON HIS DISCIPLES HIS GLANCES PIERCED AS WITH ARROWS THEIR THOUGHTS AND ARREARTHOUGHTS BUT AFTER A BRIEF SPACE HE AGAIN LAUGHED AND SAID SOOTHEDLY IT IS DIFFICULT TO LIVE AMONGST MEN BECAUSE SILENCE IS SO DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY FOR A BABBLER THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA THE HUNCHBACK HOWEVER HAD LISTENED TO THE CONVERSATION AND HAD COVERED HIS FACE DURING THE TIME BUT WHEN HE HEARD ZARATHUSTRA LAUGH HE LOOKED UP WITH CURIOSITY AND SAID SLOWLY BUT WHY DOTH ZARATHUSTRA SPEAK OTHERWISE UNTO US THAN UNTO HIS DISCIPLES ZARATHUSTRA ANSWERED WHAT IS THERE TO BE WONDERED AT WITH HUNCHBACKS ONE MAY WELL SPEAK IN A HUNCHBACKED WAY VERY GOOD SAID THE HUNCHBACK AND WITH PUPILS ONE MAY WELL TELL TALES OUT OF SCHOOL BUT WHY DOTH ZARATHUSTRA SPEAK OTHERWISE UNTO HIS PUPILSTHAN UNTO

WHEN I FOUND HIS COTBUT TWO WOLVES FOUND I THEREIN WHICH HOWLED ON ACCOUNT OF HIS DEATHFOR ALL ANIMALS LOVED HIM THEN DID I HASTE AWAY HAD I THUS COME IN VAIN INTO THESE FORESTS AND MOUNTAINS THEN DID MY HEART DETERMINE THAT I SHOULD SEEK ANOTHER THE MOST PIOUS OF ALL THOSE WHO BELIEVE NOT IN GOD MY HEART DETERMINED THAT I SHOULD SEEK ZARATHUSTRA THUS SPAKE THE HOARY MAN AND GAZED WITH KEEN EYES AT HIM WHO STOOD BEFORE HIM ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER SEIZED THE HAND OF THE OLD POPE AND REGARDED IT A LONG WHILE WITH ADMIRATION LO THOU VENERABLE ONE SAID HE THEN WHAT A FINE AND LONG HAND THAT IS THE HAND

EVERYTHING AND MANY A THING EVEN WHICH A MASTER HIDETH FROM HIMSELF HE WAS A HIDDEN GOD FULL OF SECRECY VERILY HE DID NOT COME BY HIS SON OTHERWISE THAN BY SECRET WAYS AT THE DOOR OF HIS FAITH STANDETH ADULTERY WHOEVER EXTOLLETH HIM AS A GOD OF LOVE DOTH NOT THINK HIGHLY ENOUGH OF LOVE ITSELF DID NOT THAT GOD WANT ALSO TO BE JUDGE BUT THE LOVING ONE LOVETH IRRESPECTIVE OF REWARD AND REQUITAL WHEN HE WAS YOUNG THAT GOD OUT OF THE ORIENT THEN WAS HE HARSH AND REVENGEFUL AND BUILT HIMSELF A HELL FOR THE DELIGHT OF HIS FAVOURITES AT LAST HOWEVER HE BECAME OLD AND SOFT AND MELLOW AND PITIFUL MORE LIKE A GRANDFATHER THAN A FATHER BUT MOST LIKE A TOTTERING OLD GRANDMOTHER THERE DID HE SIT SHRIVELLED IN HIS CHIMNEYCORNER FRETTING ON ACCOUNT OF HIS WEAK LEGS WORLDWEARY WILLWEARY AND ONE DAY HE SUFFOCATED OF HIS ALLTOOGREAT PITY THOU OLD POPE SAID HERE ZARATHUSTRA INTERPOSING HAST THOU SEEN THAT WITH THINE EYES IT COULD WELL HAVE HAPPENED IN THAT WAY IN THAT WAY AND ALSO OTHERWISE

ETERNITY LXXX THE SIGN IN THE MORNING HOWEVER AFTER THIS NIGHT ZARATHUSTRA JUMPED UP FROM HIS COUCH AND HAVING GIRDED HIS LOINS HE CAME OUT OF HIS CAVE GLOWING AND STRONG LIKE A MORNING SUN COMING OUT OF GLOOMY MOUNTAINS THOU GREAT STAR SPAKE HE AS HE HAD SPOKEN ONCE BEFORE THOU DEEP EYE OF HAPPINESS WHAT WOULD BE ALL THY HAPPINESS IF THOU HADST NOT THOSE FOR WHOM THOU SHINEST AND IF THEY REMAINED IN THEIR CHAMBERS WHILST THOU ART ALREADY AWAKE AND COMEST AND BESTOWEST AND DISTRIBUTEST HOW WOULD THY PROUD MODESTY UPBRAID FOR IT WELL THEY STILL SLEEP THESE HIGHER MEN WHILST I AM AWAKE THEY ARE NOT MY PROPER COMPANIONS NOT FOR THEM DO I WAIT HERE IN MY MOUNTAINS AT MY WORK I WANT TO BE AT MY DAY BUT THEY UNDERSTAND NOT WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF MY MORNING MY STEPIS NOT FOR THEM THE AWAKENINGCALL THEY STILL SLEEP IN MY CAVE THEIR DREAM STILL DRINKETH AT MY DRUNKEN SONGS THE AUDIENT EAR FOR METHE OBEDIENT EAR IS YET LACKING IN THEIR LIMBS THIS HAD ZARATHUSTRA SPOKEN TO HIS HEART WHEN THE SUN AROSE THEN LOOKED HE INQUIRINGLY ALOFT FOR HE HEARD ABOVE HIM THE SHARP CALL OF HIS EAGLE WELL CALLED HE UPWARDS THUS IS IT PLEASING AND PROPER TO ME MINE ANIMALS ARE AWAKE FOR I AM AWAKE MINE EAGLE IS AWAKE AND LIKE ME HONOURETH THE SUN WITH EAGLETALONS DOTH IT GRASP AT THE NEW LIGHT YE ARE MY PROPER ANIMALS I LOVE YOU BUT STILL DO I LACK MY PROPER MEN THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA THEN HOWEVER IT HAPPENED THAT ALL ON A SUDDEN HE BECAME AWARE THAT HE WAS FLOCKED AROUND AND FLUTTERED AROUND AS IF BY INNUMERABLE BIRDSTHE WHIZZING OF SO MANY WINGS HOWEVER AND THE CROWDING AROUND HIS HEAD WAS SO GREAT THAT HE SHUT HIS EYES AND VERILY THERE CAME DOWN UPON HIM AS IT WERE A CLOUD LIKE A CLOUD OF ARROWS WHICH POURETH UPON A NEW ENEMY BUT BEHOLD HERE IT WAS A CLOUD OF LOVE AND SHOWERED UPON A NEW FRIEND WHAT HAPPENETH UNTO ME THOUGHT ZARATHUSTRA IN HIS ASTONISHED HEART AND SLOWLY SEATED HIMSELF ON THE BIG STONE WHICH LAY CLOSE TO THE EXIT FROM HIS CAVE BUT WHILE HE GRASPED ABOUT WITH HIS HANDS AROUND HIM ABOVE HIM AND BELOW HIM AND REPELLED THE TENDER BIRDS BEHOLD THERE THEN HAPPENED TO HIM SOMETHING STILL STRANGER FOR HE GRASPED THEREBY UNAWARES INTO A MASS OF THICK WARM SHAGGY HAIR AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER THERE SOUNDED BEFORE HIM A ROARA LONG SOFT LIONROAR THE SIGN COMETH SAID ZARATHUSTRA AND A CHANGE CAME OVER HIS HEART AND IN TRUTH WHEN IT TURNED CLEAR BEFORE HIM THERE LAY A YELLOW POWERFUL ANIMAL AT HIS FEET RESTING ITS HEAD ON HIS KNEEUNWILLING TO LEAVE HIM OUT OF LOVE AND DOING LIKE A DOG WHICH AGAIN FINDETH ITS OLD MASTER THE DOVES HOWEVER WERE NO LESS EAGER WITH THEIR LOVE THAN THE LION AND WHENEVER A DOVE WHISKED OVER ITS NOSE THE LION SHOOK ITS HEAD AND WONDERED AND LAUGHED WHEN ALL THIS WENT ON ZARATHUSTRA SPAKE ONLY A WORD MY CHILDREN ARE NIGH MY CHILDREN THEN HE BECAME QUITE MUTE HIS HEART HOWEVER WAS LOOSED AND FROM HIS EYES THERE DROPPED DOWN TEARS AND FELL UPON HIS HANDS AND HE TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE OF ANYTHING BUT SAT THERE MOTIONLESS WITHOUT REPELLING THE ANIMALS FURTHER THEN FLEW THE DOVES TO AND FRO AND PERCHED ON HIS SHOULDER AND CARESSED HIS WHITE HAIR AND DID NOT TIRE OF THEIR TENDERNESS AND JOYOUSNESS THE STRONG LION HOWEVER LICKED ALWAYS THE TEARS THAT FELL ON ZARATHUSTRAS HANDS AND ROARED AND GROWLED SHYLY THUS DID THESE ANIMALS DO ALL THIS WENT ON FOR A LONG TIME OR A SHORT TIME FOR PROPERLY SPEAKING THERE IS NO TIME ON EARTH FOR SUCH THINGS MEANWHILE HOWEVER THE HIGHER MEN HAD AWAKENED IN ZARATHUSTRAS CAVE AND MARSHALLED THEMSELVES FOR A PROCESSION TO GO TO MEET ZARATHUSTRA AND GIVE HIM THEIR MORNING GREETING FOR THEY HAD FOUND WHEN THEY AWAKENED THAT HE NO LONGER TARRIED WITH THEM WHEN HOWEVER THEY REACHED THE DOOR OF THE CAVE AND THE NOISE OF THEIR STEPS HAD PRECEDED THEM THE LION STARTED VIOLENTLY IT TURNED AWAY ALL AT ONCE FROM ZARATHUSTRA AND ROARING WILDLY SPRANG TOWARDS THE CAVE THE HIGHER MEN HOWEVER WHEN THEY HEARD THE LION ROARING CRIED ALL ALOUD AS WITH ONE VOICE FLED BACK AND VANISHED IN AN INSTANT ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF HOWEVER STUNNED AND STRANGE ROSE FROM HIS SEAT LOOKED AROUND HIM STOOD THERE ASTONISHED INQUIRED OF HIS HEART BETHOUGHT HIMSELF AND REMAINED ALONE WHAT DID I HEAR SAID HE AT LAST SLOWLY WHAT HAPPENED UNTO ME JUST NOW BUT SOON THERE CAME TO HIM HIS RECOLLECTION AND HE TOOK IN AT A GLANCE ALL THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN YESTERDAY AND TODAY HERE IS INDEED THE STONE SAID HE AND STROKED HIS BEARD ON IT SAT I YESTERMORN AND HERE CAME THE SOOTHSAYER UNTO ME AND HERE HEARD I FIRST THE CRY WHICH I HEARD JUST NOW THE GREAT CRY OF DISTRESS O YE HIGHER MEN YOUR DISTRESS WAS IT THAT THE OLD SOOTHSAYER FORETOLD TO ME YESTERMORN UNTO YOUR DISTRESS DID HE WANT TO SEDUCE AND TEMPT ME O ZARATHUSTRA SAID HE TO ME I COME TO SEDUCE THEE TO THY LAST SIN TO MY LAST SIN CRIED ZARATHUSTRA AND LAUGHED ANGRILY AT HIS OWN WORDS WHAT HATH BEEN RESERVED FOR ME AS MY LAST SIN AND ONCE MORE ZARATHUSTRA BECAME ABSORBED IN HIMSELF AND SAT DOWN AGAIN ON THE BIG STONE AND MEDITATED SUDDENLY HE SPRANG UP FELLOWSUFFERING FELLOWSUFFERING WITH THE HIGHER MEN HE CRIED OUT AND HIS COUNTENANCE CHANGED INTO BRASS WELL THATHATH HAD ITS TIME MY SUFFERING AND MY FELLOWSUFFERINGWHAT MATTER ABOUT THEM DO I THEN STRIVE AFTER HAPPINESS I STRIVE AFTER MY WORK WELL THE LION HATH COME MY CHILDREN ARE NIGH ZARATHUSTRA HATH GROWN RIPE MINE HOUR HATH COME THIS IS MY MORNING MY DAY BEGINNETH ARISE NOW ARISE THOU GREAT NOONTIDE THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND LEFT HIS CAVE GLOWING AND STRONG LIKE A MORNING SUN COMING OUT OF GLOOMY MOUNTAINS APPENDIX NOTES ON THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA BY ANTHONY M LUDOVICI I HAVE HAD SOME OPPORTUNITIES OF STUDYING THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH NIETZSCHE IS READ IN GERMANY FRANCE AND ENGLAND AND I HAVE FOUND THAT IN EACH OF THESE COUNTRIES STUDENTS OF HIS PHILOSOPHY AS IF ACTUATED BY PRECISELY SIMILAR MOTIVES AND DESIRES AND MISLED BY THE SAME MISTAKEN TACTICS ON THE PART OF MOST PUBLISHERS ALL PROCEED IN THE SAME HAPPYGOLUCKY STYLE WHEN TAKING HIM UP THEY HAVE HAD IT SAID TO THEM THAT HE WROTE WITHOUT ANY SYSTEM AND THEY VERY NATURALLY CONCLUDE THAT IT DOES NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST WHETHER THEY BEGIN WITH HIS FIRST THIRD OR LAST BOOK PROVIDED THEY CAN OBTAIN A FEW VAGUE IDEAS AS TO WHAT HIS LEADING AND MOST SENSATIONAL PRINCIPLES WERE NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT THE BOOK WITH THE MOST MYSTERIOUS STARTLING OR SUGGESTIVE TITLE WILL ALWAYS STAND THE BEST CHANCE OF BEING PURCHASED BY THOSE WHO HAVE NO OTHER CRITERIA TO GUIDE THEM IN THEIR CHOICE THAN THE ASPECT OF A TITLEPAGE AND THIS EXPLAINS WHY THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE FIRST AND OFTEN THE ONLY ONE OF NIETZSCHES BOOKS THAT FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF THE UNINITIATED THE TITLE SUGGESTS ALL KINDS OF MYSTERIES A GLANCE AT THE CHAPTERHEADINGS QUICKLY CONFIRMS THE SUSPICIONS ALREADY AROUSED AND THE SUBTITLE A BOOK FOR ALL AND NONE GENERALLY SUCCEEDS IN DISSIPATING THE LAST DOUBTS THE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER MAY ENTERTAIN CONCERNING HIS FITNESS FOR THE BOOK OR ITS FITNESS FOR HIM AND WHAT HAPPENS THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA IS TAKEN HOME THE READER WHO PERCHANCE MAY KNOW NO MORE CONCERNING NIETZSCHE THAN A MAGAZINE ARTICLE HAS TOLD HIM TRIES TO READ IT AND UNDERSTANDING LESS THAN HALF HE READS PROBABLY NEVER GETS FURTHER THAN THE SECOND OR THIRD PARTAND THEN ONLY TO FEEL CONVINCED THAT NIETZSCHE HIMSELF WAS RATHER HAZY AS TO WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SUCH CHAPTERS AS THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR IN THE HAPPY ISLES THE GRAVESONG IMMACULATE PERCEPTION THE STILLEST HOUR THE SEVEN SEALS AND MANY OTHERS ARE ALMOST UTTERLY DEVOID OF MEANING TO ALL THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW SOMETHING OF NIETZSCHES LIFE HIS AIMS AND HIS FRIENDSHIPS AS A MATTER OF FACT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA THOUGH IT IS UNQUESTIONABLY NIETZSCHES OPUS MAGNUM IS BY NO MEANS THE FIRST OF NIETZSCHES WORKS THAT THE BEGINNER OUGHT TO UNDERTAKE TO READ THE AUTHOR HIMSELF REFERS TO IT AS THE DEEPEST WORK EVER OFFERED TO THE GERMAN PUBLIC AND ELSEWHERE SPEAKS OF HIS OTHER WRITINGS AS BEING NECESSARY FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT BUT WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED THAT IN ZARATHUSTRA WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE HISTORY OF HIS MOST INTIMATE EXPERIENCES FRIENDSHIPS FEUDS DISAPPOINTMENTS TRIUMPHS AND THE LIKE BUT THAT THE VERY FORM IN WHICH THEY ARE NARRATED IS ONE WHICH TENDS RATHER TO OBSCURE THAN TO THROW LIGHT UPON THEM THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH MEET THE READER WHO STARTS QUITE UNPREPARED WILL BE SEEN TO BE REALLY FORMIDABLE ZARATHUSTRA THENTHIS SHADOWY ALLEGORICAL PERSONALITY SPEAKING IN ALLEGORIES AND PARABLES AND AT TIMES NOT EVEN REFRAINING FROM RELATING HIS OWN DREAMSIS A FIGURE WE CAN UNDERSTAND BUT VERY IMPERFECTLY IF WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF HIS CREATOR AND COUNTERPART FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE AND IT WERE THEREFORE WELL PREVIOUS TO OUR STUDY OF THE MORE ABSTRUSE PARTS OF THIS BOOK IF WE WERE TO TURN TO SOME AUTHORITATIVE BOOK ON NIETZSCHES LIFE AND WORKS AND TO READ ALL THAT IS THERE SAID ON THE SUBJECT THOSE WHO CAN READ GERMAN WILL FIND AN EXCELLENT GUIDE IN THIS RESPECT IN FRAU FOERSTERNIETZSCHES EXHAUSTIVE AND HIGHLY INTERESTING BIOGRAPHY OF HER BROTHER DAS LEBEN FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHES PUBLISHED BY NAUMANN WHILE THE WORKS OF DEUSSEN RAOUL RICHTER AND BARONESS ISABELLE VON UNGERSTERNBERG WILL BE FOUND TO THROW USEFUL AND NECESSARY LIGHT UPON MANY QUESTIONS WHICH IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR A SISTER TO TOUCH UPON IN REGARD TO THE ACTUAL PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS EXPOUNDED IN THIS WORK THERE IS AN EXCELLENT WAY OF CLEARING UP ANY DIFFICULTIES THEY MAY PRESENT AND THAT IS BY AN APPEAL TO NIETZSCHES OTHER WORKS AGAIN AND AGAIN OF COURSE HE WILL BE FOUND TO EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CLEARLY THAT ALL REFERENCE TO HIS OTHER WRITINGS MAY BE DISPENSED WITH BUT WHERE THIS IS NOT THE CASE THE ADVICE HE HIMSELF GIVES IS AFTER ALL THE BEST TO BE FOLLOWED HERE VIZTO REGARD SUCH WORKS AS JOYFUL SCIENCE BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS THE ANTICHRIST THE WILL TO POWER ETC ETC AS THE NECESSARY PREPARATION FOR THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA THESE DIRECTIONS THOUGH THEY ARE BY NO MEANS SIMPLE TO CARRY OUT SEEM AT LEAST TO POSSESS THE QUALITY OF DEFINITENESS AND STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS FOLLOW THEM AND ALL WILL BE CLEAR I SEEM TO IMPLY BUT I REGRET TO SAY THAT THIS IS NOT REALLY THE CASE FOR MY EXPERIENCE TELLS ME THAT EVEN AFTER THE ABOVE DIRECTIONS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ZEAL THE STUDENT WILL STILL HALT IN PERPLEXITY BEFORE CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE BOOK BEFORE US AND WONDER WHAT THEY MEAN NOW IT IS WITH THE VIEW OF GIVING A LITTLE ADDITIONAL HELP TO ALL THOSE WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN THIS POSITION THAT I PROCEED TO PUT FORTH MY OWN PERSONAL INTERPRETATION OF THE MORE ABSTRUSE PASSAGES IN THIS WORK IN OFFERING THIS LITTLE COMMENTARY TO THE NIETZSCHE STUDENT I SHOULD LIKE IT TO BE UNDERSTOOD THAT I MAKE NO CLAIM AS TO ITS INFALLIBILITY OR INDISPENSABILITY IT REPRESENTS BUT AN ATTEMPT ON MY PARTA VERY FEEBLE ONE PERHAPSTO GIVE THE READER WHAT LITTLE HELP I CAN IN SURMOUNTING DIFFICULTIES WHICH A LONG STUDY OF NIETZSCHES LIFE AND WORKS HAS ENABLED ME PARTIALLY I HOPE TO OVERCOME PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AS WELL TO START OUT WITH A BROAD AND RAPID SKETCH OF NIETZSCHE AS A WRITER ON MORALS EVOLUTION AND SOCIOLOGY SO THAT THE READER MAY BE PREPARED TO PICK OUT FOR HIMSELF SO TO SPEAK ALL PASSAGES IN THIS WORK BEARING IN ANY WAY UPON NIETZSCHES VIEWS IN THOSE THREE IMPORTANT BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE A NIETZSCHE AND MORALITY IN MORALITY NIETZSCHE STARTS OUT BY ADOPTING THE POSITION OF THE RELATIVIST HE SAYS THERE ARE NO ABSOLUTE VALUES GOOD AND EVIL THESE ARE MERE MEANS ADOPTED BY ALL IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE POWER TO MAINTAIN THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD OR TO BECOME SUPREME IT IS THE LIONS GOOD TO DEVOUR AN ANTELOPE IT IS THE DEADLEAF BUTTERFLYS GOOD TO TELL A FOE A FALSEHOOD FOR WHEN THE DEADLEAF BUTTERFLY IS IN DANGER IT CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF A TWIG AND WHAT IT SAYS TO ITS FOE IS PRACTICALLY THIS I AM NOT A BUTTERFLY I AM A DEAD LEAF AND CAN BE OF NO USE TO THEE THIS IS A LIE WHICH IS GOOD TO THE BUTTERFLY FOR IT PRESERVES IT IN NATURE EVERY SPECIES OF ORGANIC BEING INSTINCTIVELY ADOPTS AND PRACTISES THOSE ACTS WHICH MOST CONDUCE TO THE PREVALENCE OR SUPREMACY OF ITS KIND ONCE THE MOST FAVOURABLE ORDER OF CONDUCT IS FOUND PROVED EFFICIENT AND ESTABLISHED IT BECOMES THE RULING MORALITY OF THE SPECIES THAT ADOPTS IT AND BEARS THEM ALONG TO VICTORY ALL SPECIES MUST NOT AND CANNOT VALUE ALIKE FOR WHAT IS THE LIONS GOOD IS THE ANTELOPES EVIL AND VICE VERSA CONCEPTS OF GOOD AND EVIL ARE THEREFORE IN THEIR ORIGIN MERELY A MEANS TO AN END THEY ARE EXPEDIENTS FOR ACQUIRING POWER APPLYING THIS PRINCIPLE TO MANKIND NIETZSCHE ATTACKED CHRISTIAN MORAL VALUES HE DECLARED THEM TO BE LIKE ALL OTHER MORALS MERELY AN EXPEDIENT FOR PROTECTING A CERTAIN TYPE OF MAN IN THE CASE OF CHRISTIANITY THIS TYPE WAS ACCORDING TO NIETZSCHE A LOW ONE CONFLICTING MORAL CODES HAVE BEEN NO MORE THAN THE CONFLICTING WEAPONS OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF MEN FOR IN MANKIND THERE IS A CONTINUAL WAR BETWEEN THE POWERFUL THE NOBLE THE STRONG AND THE WELLCONSTITUTED ON THE ONE SIDE AND THE IMPOTENT THE MEAN THE WEAK AND THE ILLCONSTITUTED ON THE OTHER THE WAR IS A WAR OF MORAL PRINCIPLES THE MORALITY OF THE POWERFUL CLASS NIETZSCHE CALLS NOBLE OR MASTERMORALITY THAT OF THE WEAK AND SUBORDINATE CLASS HE CALLS SLAVEMORALITY IN THE FIRST MORALITY IT IS THE EAGLE WHICH LOOKING DOWN UPON A BROWSING LAMB CONTENDS THAT EATING LAMB IS GOOD IN THE SECOND THE SLAVEMORALITY IT IS THE LAMB WHICH LOOKING UP FROM THE SWARD BLEATS DISSENTINGLY EATING LAMB IS EVIL B THE MASTER AND SLAVEMORALITY COMPARED THE FIRST MORALITY IS ACTIVE CREATIVE DIONYSIAN THE SECOND IS PASSIVE DEFENSIVETO IT BELONGS THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE WHERE ATTEMPTS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE TO RECONCILE THE TWO MORALITIES THEY MAY BE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWSALL IS GOOD IN THE NOBLE MORALITY WHICH PROCEEDS FROM STRENGTH POWER HEALTH WELLCONSTITUTEDNESS HAPPINESS AND AWFULNESS FOR THE MOTIVE FORCE BEHIND THE PEOPLE PRACTISING IT IS THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER THE ANTITHESIS GOOD AND BAD TO THIS FIRST CLASS MEANS THE SAME AS NOBLE AND DESPICABLE BAD IN THE MASTERMORALITY MUST BE APPLIED TO THE COWARD TO ALL ACTS THAT SPRING FROM WEAKNESS TO THE MAN WITH AN EYE TO THE MAIN CHANCE WHO WOULD FORSAKE EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO LIVE WITH THE SECOND THE SLAVEMORALITY THE CASE IS DIFFERENT THERE INASMUCH AS THE COMMUNITY IS AN OPPRESSED SUFFERING UNEMANCIPATED AND WEARY ONE ALL THAT WILL BE HELD TO BE GOOD WHICH ALLEVIATES THE STATE OF SUFFERING PITY THE OBLIGING HAND THE WARM HEART PATIENCE INDUSTRY AND HUMILITYTHESE ARE UNQUESTIONABLY THE QUALITIES WE SHALL HERE FIND FLOODED WITH THE LIGHT OF APPROVAL AND ADMIRATION BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST USEFUL QUALITIES THEY MAKE LIFE ENDURABLE THEY ARE OF ASSISTANCE IN THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE WHICH IS THE MOTIVE FORCE BEHIND THE PEOPLE PRACTISING THIS MORALITY TO THIS CLASS ALL THAT IS AWFUL IS BAD IN FACT IT IS THE EVIL PAR EXCELLENCE STRENGTH HEALTH SUPERABUNDANCE OF ANIMAL SPIRITS AND POWER ARE REGARDED WITH HATE SUSPICION AND FEAR BY THE SUBORDINATE CLASS NOW NIETZSCHE BELIEVED THAT THE FIRST OR THE NOBLEMORALITY CONDUCED TO AN ASCENT IN THE LINE OF LIFE BECAUSE IT WAS CREATIVE AND ACTIVE ON THE OTHER HAND HE BELIEVED THAT THE SECOND OR SLAVEMORALITY WHERE IT BECAME PARAMOUNT LED TO DEGENERATION BECAUSE IT WAS PASSIVE AND DEFENSIVE WANTING MERELY TO KEEP THOSE WHO PRACTISED IT ALIVE HENCE HIS EARNEST ADVOCACY OF NOBLEMORALITY C NIETZSCHE AND EVOLUTION NIETZSCHE AS AN EVOLUTIONIST I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO DEFINE AND DISCUSS IN THE COURSE OF THESE NOTES SEE NOTES ON CHAPTER LVI PAR AND ON CHAPTER LVII FOR THE PRESENT LET IT SUFFICE FOR US TO KNOW THAT HE ACCEPTED THE DEVELOPMENT HYPOTHESIS AS AN EXPLANATION OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES BUT HE DID NOT HALT WHERE MOST NATURALISTS HAVE HALTED HE BY NO MEANS REGARDED MAN AS THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE BEING WHICH EVOLUTION COULD ARRIVE AT FOR THOUGH HIS PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT MAY HAVE REACHED ITS LIMIT THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH HIS MENTAL OR SPIRITUAL ATTRIBUTES IF THE PROCESS BE A FACT IF THINGS HAVE BECOME WHAT THEY ARE THEN HE CONTENDS WE MAY DESCRIBE NO LIMIT TO MANS ASPIRATIONS IF HE STRUGGLED UP FROM BARBARISM AND STILL MORE REMOTELY FROM THE LOWER PRIMATES HIS IDEAL SHOULD BE TO SURPASS MAN HIMSELF AND REACH SUPERMAN SEE ESPECIALLY THE PROLOGUE D NIETZSCHE AND SOCIOLOGY NIETZSCHE AS A SOCIOLOGIST AIMS AT AN ARISTOCRATIC ARRANGEMENT OF SOCIETY HE WOULD HAVE US REAR AN IDEAL RACE HONEST AND TRUTHFUL IN INTELLECTUAL MATTERS HE COULD NOT EVEN THINK THAT MEN ARE EQUAL WITH THESE PREACHERS OF EQUALITY WILL I NOT BE MIXED UP AND CONFOUNDED FOR THUS SPEAKETH JUSTICE UNTO ME MEN ARE NOT EQUAL HE SEES PRECISELY IN THIS INEQUALITY A PURPOSE TO BE SERVED A CONDITION TO BE EXPLOITED EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HE WRITES IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETYAND SO WILL IT ALWAYS BEA SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS THOSE WHO ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTERESTED TO DESIRE TO READ HIS OWN DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE SOCIETY HE WOULD FAIN ESTABLISH WILL FIND AN EXCELLENT PASSAGE IN APHORISM OF THE ANTICHRIST PART I THE PROLOGUE IN PART I INCLUDING THE PROLOGUE NO VERY GREAT DIFFICULTIES WILL APPEAR ZARATHUSTRAS HABIT OF DESIGNATING A WHOLE CLASS OF MEN OR A WHOLE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT BY A SINGLE FITTING NICKNAME MAY PERHAPS LEAD TO A LITTLE CONFUSION AT FIRST BUT AS A RULE WHEN THE GENERAL DRIFT OF HIS ARGUMENTS IS GRASPED IT REQUIRES BUT A SLIGHT EFFORT OF THE IMAGINATION TO DISCOVER WHOM HE IS REFERRING TO IN THE NINTH PARAGRAPH OF THE PROLOGUE FOR INSTANCE IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT HERDSMEN IN THE VERSE HERDSMEN I SAY ETC ETC STANDS FOR ALL THOSE TODAY WHO ARE THE ADVOCATES OF GREGARIOUSNESSOF THE ANTHILL AND WHEN OUR AUTHOR SAYS A ROBBER SHALL ZARATHUSTRA BE CALLED BY THE HERDSMEN IT IS CLEAR THAT THESE WORDS MAY BE TAKEN ALMOST LITERALLY FROM ONE WHOSE IDEAL WAS THE REARING OF A HIGHER ARISTOCRACY AGAIN THE GOOD AND JUST THROUGHOUT THE BOOK IS THE EXPRESSION USED IN REFERRING TO THE SELFRIGHTEOUS OF MODERN TIMESTHOSE WHO ARE QUITE SURE THAT THEY KNOW ALL THAT IS TO BE KNOWN CONCERNING GOOD AND EVIL AND ARE SATISFIED THAT THE VALUES THEIR LITTLE WORLD OF TRADITION HAS HANDED DOWN TO THEM ARE DESTINED TO RULE MANKIND AS LONG AS IT LASTS IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THE PROLOGUE VERSE ZARATHUSTRA GIVES US A FORETASTE OF HIS TEACHING CONCERNING THE BIG AND THE LITTLE SAGACITIES EXPOUNDED SUBSEQUENTLY HE SAYS HE WOULD HE WERE AS WISE AS HIS SERPENT THIS DESIRE WILL BE FOUND EXPLAINED IN THE DISCOURSE ENTITLED THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY WHICH I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO REFER TO LATER THE DISCOURSES CHAPTER I THE THREE METAMORPHOSES THIS OPENING DISCOURSE IS A PARABLE IN WHICH ZARATHUSTRA DISCLOSES THE MENTAL DEVELOPMENT OF ALL CREATORS OF NEW VALUES IT IS THE STORY OF A LIFE WHICH REACHES ITS CONSUMMATION IN ATTAINING TO A SECOND INGENUOUSNESS OR IN RETURNING TO CHILDHOOD NIETZSCHE THE SUPPOSED ANARCHIST HERE PLAINLY DISCLAIMS ALL RELATIONSHIP WHATEVER TO ANARCHY FOR HE SHOWS US THAT ONLY BY BEARING THE BURDENS OF THE EXISTING LAW AND SUBMITTING TO IT PATIENTLY AS THE CAMEL SUBMITS TO BEING LADEN DOES THE FREE SPIRIT ACQUIRE THAT ASCENDANCY OVER TRADITION WHICH ENABLES HIM TO MEET AND MASTER THE DRAGON THOU SHALTTHE DRAGON WITH THE VALUES OF A THOUSAND YEARS GLITTERING ON ITS SCALES THERE ARE TWO LESSONS IN THIS DISCOURSE FIRST THAT IN ORDER TO CREATE ONE MUST BE AS A LITTLE CHILD SECONDLY THAT IT IS ONLY THROUGH EXISTING LAW AND ORDER THAT ONE ATTAINS TO THAT HEIGHT FROM WHICH NEW LAW AND NEW ORDER MAY BE PROMULGATED CHAPTER II THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE ALMOST THE WHOLE OF THIS IS QUITE COMPREHENSIBLE IT IS A DISCOURSE AGAINST ALL THOSE WHO CONFOUND VIRTUE WITH TAMENESS AND SMUG EASE AND WHO REGARD AS VIRTUOUS ONLY THAT WHICH PROMOTES SECURITY AND TENDS TO DEEPEN SLEEP CHAPTER IV THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY HERE ZARATHUSTRA GIVES NAMES TO THE INTELLECT AND THE INSTINCTS HE CALLS THE ONE THE LITTLE SAGACITY AND THE LATTER THE BIG SAGACITY SCHOPENHAUERS TEACHING CONCERNING THE INTELLECT IS FULLY ENDORSED HERE AN INSTRUMENT OF THY BODY IS ALSO THY LITTLE SAGACITY MY BROTHER WHICH THOU CALLEST SPIRIT SAYS ZARATHUSTRA FROM BEGINNING TO END IT IS A WARNING TO THOSE WHO WOULD THINK TOO LIGHTLY OF THE INSTINCTS AND UNDULY EXALT THE INTELLECT AND ITS DERIVATIVES REASON AND UNDERSTANDING CHAPTER IX THE PREACHERS OF DEATH THIS IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE THE EVIL EYE AND ARE PESSIMISTS BY VIRTUE OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONS CHAPTER XV THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS IN THIS DISCOURSE ZARATHUSTRA OPENS HIS EXPOSITION OF THE DOCTRINE OF RELATIVITY IN MORALITY AND DECLARES ALL MORALITY TO BE A MERE MEANS TO POWER NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT VERSES AND REFER TO THE GREEKS THE PERSIANS THE JEWS AND THE GERMANS RESPECTIVELY IN THE PENULTIMATE VERSE HE MAKES KNOWN HIS DISCOVERY CONCERNING THE ROOT OF MODERN NIHILISM AND INDIFFERENCEIE THAT MODERN MAN HAS NO GOAL NO AIM NO IDEALS SEE NOTE A CHAPTER XVIII OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN NIETZSCHES VIEWS ON WOMEN HAVE EITHER TO BE LOVED AT FIRST SIGHT OR THEY BECOME PERHAPS THE GREATEST OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF THOSE WHO OTHERWISE WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCEPT HIS PHILOSOPHY WOMEN ESPECIALLY OF COURSE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO DISLIKE THEM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN RUMOURED THAT HIS VIEWS ARE UNFRIENDLY TO THEMSELVES NOW TO MY MIND ALL THIS IS PURE MISUNDERSTANDING AND ERROR GERMAN PHILOSOPHERS THANKS TO SCHOPENHAUER HAVE EARNED RATHER A BAD NAME FOR THEIR VIEWS ON WOMEN IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ONE OF THEM TO WRITE A LINE ON THE SUBJECT HOWEVER KINDLY HE MAY DO SO WITHOUT BEING SUSPECTED OF WISHING TO OPEN A CRUSADE AGAINST THE FAIR SEX DESPITE THE FACT THEREFORE THAT ALL NIETZSCHES VIEWS IN THIS RESPECT WERE DICTATED TO HIM BY THE PROFOUNDEST LOVE DESPITE ZARATHUSTRAS RESERVATION IN THIS DISCOURSE THAT WITH WOMEN NOTHING THAT CAN BE SAID IS IMPOSSIBLE AND IN THE FACE OF OTHER OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY NIETZSCHE IS UNIVERSALLY REPORTED TO HAVE MIS SON PIED DANS LE PLAT WHERE THE FEMALE SEX IS CONCERNED AND WHAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINE WHICH HAS GIVEN RISE TO SO MUCH BITTERNESS AND AVERSIONMERELY THIS THAT THE SEXES ARE AT BOTTOM ANTAGONISTICTHAT IS TO SAY AS DIFFERENT AS BLUE IS FROM YELLOW AND THAT THE BEST POSSIBLE MEANS OF REARING ANYTHING APPROACHING A DESIRABLE RACE IS TO PRESERVE AND TO FOSTER THIS PROFOUND HOSTILITY WHAT NIETZSCHE STRIVES TO COMBAT AND TO OVERTHROW IS THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC TENDENCY WHICH IS SLOWLY LABOURING TO LEVEL ALL THINGSEVEN THE SEXES HIS QUARREL IS NOT WITH WOMENWHAT INDEED COULD BE MORE UNDIGNIFIEDIT IS WITH THOSE WHO WOULD DESTROY THE NATURAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SEXES BY MODIFYING EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THEM MORE ALIKE THE HUMAN WORLD IS JUST AS DEPENDENT UPON WOMENS POWERS AS UPON MENS IT IS WOMENS STRONGEST AND MOST VALUABLE INSTINCTS WHICH HELP TO DETERMINE WHO ARE TO BE THE FATHERS OF THE NEXT GENERATION BY DESTROYING THESE PARTICULAR INSTINCTS THAT IS TO SAY BY ATTEMPTING TO MASCULINISE WOMAN AND TO FEMINISE MEN WE JEOPARDISE THE FUTURE OF OUR PEOPLE THE GENERAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT OF MODERN TIMES IN ITS FRANTIC STRUGGLE TO MITIGATE ALL DIFFERENCES IS NOW INVADING EVEN THE WORLD OF SEX IT IS AGAINST THIS MOVEMENT THAT NIETZSCHE RAISES HIS VOICE HE WOULD HAVE WOMAN BECOME EVER MORE WOMAN AND MAN BECOME EVER MORE MAN ONLY THUS AND HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY RIGHT CAN THEIR COMBINED INSTINCTS LEAD TO THE EXCELLENCE OF HUMANITY REGARDED IN THIS LIGHT ALL HIS VIEWS ON WOMAN APPEAR NOT ONLY NECESSARY BUT JUST SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVI PAR IT IS INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THAT THE LAST LINE OF THE DISCOURSE WHICH HAS SO FREQUENTLY BEEN USED BY WOMEN AS A WEAPON AGAINST NIETZSCHES VIEWS CONCERNING THEM WAS SUGGESTED TO NIETZSCHE BY A WOMAN SEE DAS LEBEN F NIETZSCHES CHAPTER XXI VOLUNTARY DEATH IN REGARD TO THIS DISCOURSE I SHOULD ONLY LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT NIETZSCHE HAD A PARTICULAR AVERSION TO THE WORD SUICIDESELFMURDER HE DISLIKED THE EVIL IT SUGGESTED AND IN RECHRISTENING THE ACT VOLUNTARY DEATH IE THE DEATH THAT COMES FROM NO OTHER HAND THAN ONES OWN HE WAS DESIROUS OF ELEVATING IT TO THE POSITION IT HELD IN CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY SEE APHORISM IN THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS CHAPTER XXII THE BESTOWING VIRTUE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY IS BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN THIS DISCOURSE HIS TEACHING AS IS WELL KNOWN PLACES THE ARISTOTELIAN MAN OF SPIRIT ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN THE NATURAL DIVISIONS OF MAN THE MAN WITH OVERFLOWING STRENGTH BOTH OF MIND AND BODY WHO MUST DISCHARGE THIS STRENGTH OR PERISH IS THE NIETZSCHEAN IDEAL TO SUCH A MAN GIVING FROM HIS OVERFLOW BECOMES A NECESSITY BESTOWING DEVELOPS INTO A MEANS OF EXISTENCE AND THIS IS THE ONLY GIVING THE ONLY CHARITY THAT NIETZSCHE RECOGNISES IN PARAGRAPH OF THE DISCOURSE WE READ ZARATHUSTRAS HEALTHY EXHORTATION TO HIS DISCIPLES TO BECOME INDEPENDENT THINKERS AND TO FIND THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY LEARN ANY MORE FROM HIM SEE NOTES ON CHAPTERS LVI PAR AND LXXIII PARS PART II CHAPTER XXIII THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR NIETZSCHE TELLS US HERE IN A POETICAL FORM HOW DEEPLY GRIEVED HE WAS BY THE MANIFOLD MISINTERPRETATIONS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS WHICH WERE BECOMING RIFE CONCERNING HIS PUBLICATIONS HE DOES NOT RECOGNISE HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR OF PUBLIC OPINION AND RECOILS TERRIFIED FROM THE DISTORTED REFLECTION OF HIS FEATURES IN VERSE HE GIVES US A HINT WHICH IT WERE WELL NOT TO PASS OVER TOO LIGHTLY FOR IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS WRITTEN IN HE FINDS IT NECESSARY TO REFER TO THE MATTER AGAIN AND WITH GREATER PRECISION THE POINT IS THIS THAT A CREATOR OF NEW VALUES MEETS WITH HIS SUREST AND STRONGEST OBSTACLES IN THE VERY SPIRIT OF THE LANGUAGE WHICH IS AT HIS DISPOSAL WORDS LIKE ALL OTHER MANIFESTATIONS OF AN EVOLVING RACE ARE STAMPED WITH THE VALUES THAT HAVE LONG BEEN PARAMOUNT IN THAT RACE NOW THE ORIGINAL THINKER WHO FINDS HIMSELF COMPELLED TO USE THE CURRENT SPEECH OF HIS COUNTRY IN ORDER TO IMPART NEW AND HITHERTO UNTRIED VIEWS TO HIS FELLOWS IMPOSES A TASK UPON THE NATURAL MEANS OF COMMUNICATION WHICH IT IS TOTALLY UNFITTED TO PERFORMHENCE THE OBSCURITIES AND PROLIXITIES WHICH ARE SO FREQUENTLY MET WITH IN THE WRITINGS OF ORIGINAL THINKERS IN THE DAWN OF DAY NIETZSCHE ACTUALLY CAUTIONS YOUNG WRITERS AGAINST THE DANGER OF ALLOWING THEIR THOUGHTS TO BE MOULDED BY THE WORDS AT THEIR DISPOSAL CHAPTER XXIV IN THE HAPPY ISLES WHILE WRITING THIS NIETZSCHE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN THINKING OF THE ISLAND OF ISCHIA WHICH WAS ULTIMATELY DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE HIS TEACHING HERE IS QUITE CLEAR HE WAS AMONG THE FIRST THINKERS OF EUROPE TO OVERCOME THE PESSIMISM WHICH GODLESSNESS GENERALLY BRINGS IN ITS WAKE HE POINTS TO CREATING AS THE SUREST SALVATION FROM THE SUFFERING WHICH IS A CONCOMITANT OF ALL HIGHER LIFE WHAT WOULD THERE BE TO CREATE HE ASKS IF THERE WEREGODS HIS IDEAL THE SUPERMAN LENDS HIM THE CHEERFULNESS NECESSARY TO THE OVERCOMING OF THAT DESPAIR USUALLY ATTENDANT UPON GODLESSNESS AND UPON THE APPARENT AIMLESSNESS OF A WORLD WITHOUT A GOD CHAPTER XXIX THE TARANTULAS THE TARANTULAS ARE THE SOCIALISTS AND DEMOCRATS THIS DISCOURSE OFFERS US AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR MENTAL ATTITUDE NIETZSCHE REFUSES TO BE CONFOUNDED WITH THOSE RESENTFUL AND REVENGEFUL ONES WHO CONDEMN SOCIETY FROM BELOW AND WHOSE CRITICISM IS ONLY SUPPRESSED ENVY THERE ARE THOSE WHO PREACH MY DOCTRINE OF LIFE HE SAYS OF THE NIETZSCHEAN SOCIALISTS AND ARE AT THE SAME TIME PREACHERS OF EQUALITY AND TARANTULAS SEE NOTES ON CHAPTER XL AND CHAPTER LI CHAPTER XXX THE FAMOUS WISE ONES THIS REFERS TO ALL THOSE PHILOSOPHERS HITHERTO WHO HAVE RUN IN THE HARNESS OF ESTABLISHED VALUES AND HAVE NOT RISKED THEIR REPUTATION WITH THE PEOPLE IN PURSUIT OF TRUTH THE PHILOSOPHER HOWEVER AS NIETZSCHE UNDERSTOOD HIM IS A MAN WHO CREATES NEW VALUES AND THUS LEADS MANKIND IN A NEW DIRECTION CHAPTER XXXIII THE GRAVESONG HERE ZARATHUSTRA SINGS ABOUT THE IDEALS AND FRIENDSHIPS OF HIS YOUTH VERSES TO UNDOUBTEDLY REFER TO RICHARD WAGNER SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LXV CHAPTER XXXIV SELFSURPASSING IN THIS DISCOURSE WE GET THE BEST EXPOSITION IN THE WHOLE BOOK OF NIETZSCHES DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER I GO INTO THIS QUESTION THOROUGHLY IN THE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII NIETZSCHE WAS NOT AN ICONOCLAST FROM CHOICE THOSE WHO HASTILY CLASS HIM WITH THE ANARCHISTS OR THE PROGRESSIVISTS OF THE LAST CENTURY FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE HIGH ESTEEM IN WHICH HE ALWAYS HELD BOTH LAW AND DISCIPLINE IN VERSE OF THIS MOST DECISIVE DISCOURSE HE TRULY EXPLAINS HIS POSITION WHEN HE SAYS HE WHO HATH TO BE A CREATOR IN GOOD AND EVILVERILY HE HATH FIRST TO BE A DESTROYER AND BREAK VALUES IN PIECES THIS TEACHING IN REGARD TO SELFCONTROL IS EVIDENCE ENOUGH OF HIS REVERENCE FOR LAW CHAPTER XXXV THE SUBLIME ONES THESE BELONG TO A TYPE WHICH NIETZSCHE DID NOT ALTOGETHER DISLIKE BUT WHICH HE WOULD FAIN HAVE RENDERED MORE SUBTLE AND PLASTIC IT IS THE TYPE THAT TAKES LIFE AND ITSELF TOO SERIOUSLY THAT NEVER SURMOUNTS THE CAMELSTAGE MENTIONED IN THE FIRST DISCOURSE AND THAT IS OBDURATELY SUBLIME AND EARNEST TO BE ABLE TO SMILE WHILE SPEAKING OF LOFTY THINGS AND NOT TO BE OPPRESSED BY THEM IS THE SECRET OF REAL GREATNESS HE WHOSE HAND TREMBLES WHEN IT LAYS HOLD OF A BEAUTIFUL THING HAS THE QUALITY OF REVERENCE WITHOUT THE ARTISTS UNEMBARRASSED FRIENDSHIP WITH THE BEAUTIFUL HENCE THE MISTAKES WHICH HAVE ARISEN IN REGARD TO CONFOUNDING NIETZSCHE WITH HIS EXTREME OPPOSITES THE ANARCHISTS AND AGITATORS FOR WHAT THEY DARE TO TOUCH AND BREAK WITH THE IMPUDENCE AND IRREVERENCE OF THE UNAPPRECIATIVE HE SEEMS LIKEWISE TO TOUCH AND BREAKBUT WITH OTHER FINGERSWITH THE FINGERS OF THE LOVING AND UNEMBARRASSED ARTIST WHO IS ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE BEAUTIFUL AND WHO FEELS ABLE TO CREATE IT AND TO ENHANCE IT WITH HIS TOUCH THE QUESTION OF TASTE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART IN NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY AND VERSES OF THIS DISCOURSE EXACTLY STATE NIETZSCHES ULTIMATE VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT IN THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY HE ACTUALLY CRIESNEITHER A GOOD NOR A BAD TASTE BUT MY TASTE OF WHICH I HAVE NO LONGER EITHER SHAME OR SECRECY CHAPTER XXXVI THE LAND OF CULTURE THIS IS A POETICAL EPITOME OF SOME OF THE SCATHING CRITICISM OF SCHOLARS WHICH APPEARS IN THE FIRST OF THE THOUGHTS OUT OF SEASONTHE POLEMICAL PAMPHLET WRITTEN IN AGAINST DAVID STRAUSS AND HIS SCHOOL HE REPROACHES HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES WITH BEING STERILE AND SHOWS THEM THAT THEIR STERILITY IS THE RESULT OF THEIR NOT BELIEVING IN ANYTHING HE WHO HAD TO CREATE HAD ALWAYS HIS PRESAGING DREAMS AND ASTRAL PREMONITIONSAND BELIEVED IN BELIEVING SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LXXVII IN THE LAST TWO VERSES HE REVEALS THE NATURE OF HIS ALTRUISM HOW FAR IT DIFFERS FROM THAT OF CHRISTIANITY WE HAVE ALREADY READ IN THE DISCOURSE NEIGHBOURLOVE BUT HERE HE TELLS US DEFINITELY THE NATURE OF HIS LOVE TO MANKIND HE EXPLAINS WHY HE WAS COMPELLED TO ASSAIL THE CHRISTIAN VALUES OF PITY AND EXCESSIVE LOVE OF THE NEIGHBOUR NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE SLAVEVALUES AND THEREFORE TEND TO PROMOTE DEGENERATION SEE NOTE B BUT BECAUSE HE COULD ONLY LOVE HIS CHILDRENS LAND THE UNDISCOVERED LAND IN A REMOTE SEA BECAUSE HE WOULD FAIN RETRIEVE THE ERRORS OF HIS FATHERS IN HIS CHILDREN CHAPTER XXXVII IMMACULATE PERCEPTION AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF NIETZSCHES INTERPRETATION OF LIFE IS DISCLOSED IN THIS DISCOURSE AS BUCKLE SUGGESTS IN HIS INFLUENCE OF WOMEN ON THE PROGRESS OF KNOWLEDGE THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT OF THE INVESTIGATOR IS BOTH HELPED AND SUPPLEMENTED BY THE LATTERS EMOTIONS AND PERSONALITY AND THE DIVORCE OF ALL EMOTIONALISM AND INDIVIDUAL TEMPERAMENT FROM SCIENCE IS A FATAL STEP TOWARDS STERILITY ZARATHUSTRA ABJURES ALL THOSE WHO WOULD FAIN TURN AN IMPERSONAL EYE UPON NATURE AND CONTEMPLATE HER PHENOMENA WITH THAT PURE OBJECTIVITY TO WHICH THE SCIENTIFIC IDEALISTS OF TODAY WOULD SO MUCH LIKE TO ATTAIN HE ACCUSES SUCH IDEALISTS OF HYPOCRISY AND GUILE HE SAYS THEY LACK INNOCENCE IN THEIR DESIRES AND THEREFORE SLANDER ALL DESIRING CHAPTER XXXVIII SCHOLARS THIS IS A RECORD OF NIETZSCHES FINAL BREACH WITH HIS FORMER COLLEAGUESTHE SCHOLARS OF GERMANY ALREADY AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY NUMBERS OF GERMAN PHILOLOGISTS AND PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHERS HAD DENOUNCED HIM AS ONE WHO HAD STRAYED TOO FAR FROM THEIR FLOCK AND HIS LECTURES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BALE WERE DESERTED IN CONSEQUENCE BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL WHEN HE FINALLY SEVERED ALL CONNECTION WITH UNIVERSITY WORK THAT HE MAY BE SAID TO HAVE ATTAINED TO THE FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE WHICH STAMP THIS DISCOURSE CHAPTER XXXIX POETS PEOPLE HAVE SOMETIMES SAID THAT NIETZSCHE HAD NO SENSE OF HUMOUR I HAVE NO INTENTION OF DEFENDING HIM HERE AGAINST SUCH FOOLISH CRITICS I SHOULD ONLY LIKE TO POINT OUT TO THE READER THAT WE HAVE HIM HERE AT HIS BEST POKING FUN AT HIMSELF AND AT HIS FELLOWPOETS SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LXIII PARS CHAPTER XL GREAT EVENTS HERE WE SEEM TO HAVE A PUZZLE ZARATHUSTRA HIMSELF WHILE RELATING HIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE FIREDOG TO HIS DISCIPLES FAILS TO GET THEM INTERESTED IN HIS NARRATIVE AND WE ALSO MAY BE ONLY TOO READY TO TURN OVER THESE PAGES UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE LITTLE MORE THAN A MERE PHANTASY OR POETICAL FLIGHT ZARATHUSTRAS INTERVIEW WITH THE FIREDOG IS HOWEVER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN IT WE FIND NIETZSCHE FACE TO FACE WITH THE CREATURE HE MOST SINCERELY LOATHESTHE SPIRIT OF REVOLUTION AND WE OBTAIN FRESH HINTS CONCERNING HIS HATRED OF THE ANARCHIST AND REBEL FREEDOM YE ALL ROAR MOST EAGERLY HE SAYS TO THE FIREDOG BUT I HAVE UNLEARNED THE BELIEF IN GREAT EVENTS WHEN THERE IS MUCH ROARING AND SMOKE ABOUT THEM NOT AROUND THE INVENTORS OF NEW NOISE BUT AROUND THE INVENTORS OF NEW VALUES DOTH THE WORLD REVOLVE INAUDIBLY IT REVOLVETH CHAPTER XLI THE SOOTHSAYER THIS REFERS OF COURSE TO SCHOPENHAUER NIETZSCHE AS IS WELL KNOWN WAS AT ONE TIME AN ARDENT FOLLOWER OF SCHOPENHAUER HE OVERCAME PESSIMISM BY DISCOVERING AN OBJECT IN EXISTENCE HE SAW THE POSSIBILITY OF RAISING SOCIETY TO A HIGHER LEVEL AND PREACHED THE PROFOUNDEST OPTIMISM IN CONSEQUENCE CHAPTER XLII REDEMPTION ZARATHUSTRA HERE ADDRESSES CRIPPLES HE TELLS THEM OF OTHER CRIPPLESTHE GREAT MEN IN THIS WORLD WHO HAVE ONE ORGAN OR FACULTY INORDINATELY DEVELOPED AT THE COST OF THEIR OTHER FACULTIES THIS IS DOUBTLESS A REFERENCE TO A FACT WHICH IS TOO OFTEN NOTICEABLE IN THE CASE OF SO MANY OF THE WORLDS GIANTS IN ART SCIENCE OR RELIGION IN VERSE WE ARE TOLD WHAT NIETZSCHE CALLED REDEMPTIONTHAT IS TO SAY THE ABILITY TO SAY OF ALL THAT IS PAST THUS WOULD I HAVE IT THE IN ABILITY TO SAY THIS AND THE RESENTMENT WHICH RESULTS THEREFROM HE REGARDS AS THE SOURCE OF ALL OUR FEELINGS OF REVENGE AND ALL OUR DESIRES TO PUNISHPUNISHMENT MEANING TO HIM MERELY A EUPHEMISM FOR THE WORD REVENGE INVENTED IN ORDER TO STILL OUR CONSCIENCES HE WHO CAN BE PROUD OF HIS ENEMIES WHO CAN BE GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR THE OBSTACLES THEY HAVE PUT IN HIS WAY HE WHO CAN REGARD HIS WORST CALAMITY AS BUT THE EXTRA STRAIN ON THE BOW OF HIS LIFE WHICH IS TO SEND THE ARROW OF HIS LONGING EVEN FURTHER THAN HE COULD HAVE HOPEDTHIS MAN KNOWS NO REVENGE NEITHER DOES HE KNOW DESPAIR HE TRULY HAS FOUND REDEMPTION AND CAN TURN ON THE WORST IN HIS LIFE AND EVEN IN HIMSELF AND CALL IT HIS BEST SEE NOTES ON CHAPTER LVII CHAPTER XLIII MANLY PRUDENCE THIS DISCOURSE IS VERY IMPORTANT IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL WE HEAR OFTEN ENOUGH THAT THE SELECT AND SUPERIOR MAN MUST WEAR A MASK AND HERE WE FIND THIS INJUNCTION EXPLAINED AND HE WHO WOULD NOT LANGUISH AMONGST MEN MUST LEARN TO DRINK OUT OF ALL GLASSES AND HE WHO WOULD KEEP CLEAN AMONGST MEN MUST KNOW HOW TO WASH HIMSELF EVEN WITH DIRTY WATER THIS I VENTURE TO SUGGEST REQUIRES SOME EXPLANATION AT A TIME WHEN INDIVIDUALITY IS SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWN MOST TELLINGLY BY PUTTING BOOTS ON ONES HANDS AND GLOVES ON ONES FEET IT IS SOMEWHAT REFRESHING TO COME ACROSS A TRUE INDIVIDUALIST WHO FEELS THE CHASM BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS SO DEEPLY THAT HE MUST PERFORCE ADAPT HIMSELF TO THEM OUTWARDLY AT LEAST IN ALL RESPECTS SO THAT THE INNER DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE OVERLOOKED NIETZSCHE PRACTICALLY TELLS US HERE THAT IT IS NOT HE WHO INTENTIONALLY WEARS ECCENTRIC CLOTHES OR DOES ECCENTRIC THINGS WHO IS TRULY THE INDIVIDUALIST THE PROFOUND MAN WHO IS BY NATURE DIFFERENTIATED FROM HIS FELLOWS FEELS THIS DIFFERENCE TOO KEENLY TO CALL ATTENTION TO IT BY ANY OUTWARD SHOW HE IS SHAMEFAST AND BASHFUL WITH THOSE WHO SURROUND HIM AND WISHES NOT TO BE DISCOVERED BY THEM JUST AS ONE INSTINCTIVELY AVOIDS ALL LAVISH DISPLAY OF COMFORT OR WEALTH IN THE PRESENCE OF A POOR FRIEND CHAPTER XLIV THE STILLEST HOUR THIS SEEMS TO ME TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT STRUGGLE WHICH MUST HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN NIETZSCHES SOUL BEFORE HE FINALLY RESOLVED TO MAKE KNOWN THE MORE ESOTERIC PORTIONS OF HIS TEACHING OUR DEEPEST FEELINGS CRAVE SILENCE THERE IS A CERTAIN SELFRESPECT IN THE SERIOUS MAN WHICH MAKES HIM HOLD HIS PROFOUNDEST FEELINGS SACRED BEFORE THEY ARE UTTERED THEY ARE FULL OF THE MODESTY OF A VIRGIN AND OFTEN THE OLDEST SAGE WILL BLUSH LIKE A GIRL WHEN THIS VIRGINITY IS VIOLATED BY AN INDISCRETION WHICH FORCES HIM TO REVEAL HIS DEEPEST THOUGHTS PART III THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THE FOUR PARTS IF IT CONTAINED ONLY THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA AND THE OLD AND NEW TABLES I SHOULD STILL BE OF THIS OPINION FOR IN THE FORMER OF THESE DISCOURSES WE MEET WITH WHAT NIETZSCHE REGARDED AS THE CROWNING DOCTRINE OF HIS PHILOSOPHY AND IN THE OLD AND NEW TABLES WE HAVE A VALUABLE EPITOME OF PRACTICALLY ALL HIS LEADING PRINCIPLES CHAPTER XLVI THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA IS PERHAPS AN EXAMPLE OF NIETZSCHE IN HIS MOST OBSCURE VEIN WE MUST KNOW HOW PERSISTENTLY HE INVEIGHED AGAINST THE OPPRESSING AND DEPRESSING INFLUENCE OF MANS SENSE OF GUILT AND CONSCIOUSNESS OF SIN IN ORDER FULLY TO GRASP THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS DISCOURSE SLOWLY BUT SURELY HE THOUGHT THE VALUES OF CHRISTIANITY AND JUDAIC TRADITIONS HAD DONE THEIR WORK IN THE MINDS OF MEN WHAT WERE ONCE BUT EXPEDIENTS DEVISED FOR THE DISCIPLINE OF A CERTAIN PORTION OF HUMANITY HAD NOW PASSED INTO MANS BLOOD AND HAD BECOME INSTINCTS THIS OPPRESSIVE AND PARALYSING SENSE OF GUILT AND OF SIN IS WHAT NIETZSCHE REFERS TO WHEN HE SPEAKS OF THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY THIS CREATURE HALFDWARF HALFMOLE WHOM HE BEARS WITH HIM A CERTAIN DISTANCE ON HIS CLIMB AND FINALLY DEFIES AND WHOM HE CALLS HIS DEVIL AND ARCHENEMY IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE HEAVY MILLSTONE GUILTY CONSCIENCE TOGETHER WITH THE CONCEPT OF SIN WHICH AT PRESENT HANGS ROUND THE NECK OF MEN TO RISE ABOVE ITTO SOARIS THE MOST DIFFICULT OF ALL THINGS TODAY NIETZSCHE IS ABLE TO THINK CHEERFULLY AND OPTIMISTICALLY OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LIFE IN THIS WORLD RECURRING AGAIN AND AGAIN WHEN HE HAS ONCE CAST THE DWARF FROM HIS SHOULDERS AND HE ANNOUNCES HIS DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL TO HIS ARCHENEMY AND IN DEFIANCE OF HIM THAT THERE IS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR NIETZSCHES HYPOTHESIS OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS GREAT AND SMALL NOBODY WHO HAS READ THE LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT WILL DOUBT FOR AN INSTANT BUT IT REMAINS A VERY DARING CONJECTURE NOTWITHSTANDING AND EVEN IN ITS ULTIMATE EFFECT AS A DOGMA ON THE MINDS OF MEN I VENTURE TO DOUBT WHETHER NIETZSCHE EVER PROPERLY ESTIMATED ITS WORTH SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII WHAT FOLLOWS IS CLEAR ENOUGH ZARATHUSTRA SEES A YOUNG SHEPHERD STRUGGLING ON THE GROUND WITH A SNAKE HOLDING FAST TO THE BACK OF HIS THROAT THE SAGE ASSUMING THAT THE SNAKE MUST HAVE CRAWLED INTO THE YOUNG MANS MOUTH WHILE HE LAY SLEEPING RUNS TO HIS HELP AND PULLS AT THE LOATHSOME REPTILE WITH ALL HIS MIGHT BUT IN VAIN AT LAST IN DESPAIR ZARATHUSTRA APPEALS TO THE YOUNG MANS WILL KNOWING FULL WELL WHAT A GHASTLY OPERATION HE IS RECOMMENDING HE NEVERTHELESS CRIES BITE BITE ITS HEAD OFF BITE AS THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF THE DIFFICULTY THE YOUNG SHEPHERD BITES AND FAR AWAY HE SPITS THE SNAKES HEAD WHEREUPON HE RISES NO LONGER SHEPHERD NO LONGER MANA TRANSFIGURED BEING A LIGHTSURROUNDED BEING THAT LAUGHED NEVER ON EARTH LAUGHED A MAN AS HE LAUGHED IN THIS PARABLE THE YOUNG SHEPHERD IS OBVIOUSLY THE MAN OF TODAY THE SNAKE THAT CHOKES HIM REPRESENTS THE STULTIFYING AND PARALYSING SOCIAL VALUES THAT THREATEN TO SHATTER HUMANITY AND THE ADVICE BITE BITE IS BUT NIETZSCHES EXASPERATED CRY TO MANKIND TO ALTER THEIR VALUES BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE CHAPTER XLVII INVOLUNTARY BLISS THIS LIKE THE WANDERER IS ONE OF THE MANY INTROSPECTIVE PASSAGES IN THE WORK AND IS FULL OF INNUENDOS AND HINTS AS TO THE NIETZSCHEAN OUTLOOK ON LIFE CHAPTER XLVIII BEFORE SUNRISE HERE WE HAVE A RECORD OF ZARATHUSTRAS AVOWAL OF OPTIMISM AS ALSO THE IMPORTANT STATEMENT CONCERNING CHANCE OR ACCIDENT VERSE THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY WILL NOT REQUIRE TO BE TOLD WHAT AN IMPORTANT ROLE HIS DOCTRINE OF CHANCE PLAYS IN HIS TEACHING THE GIANT CHANCE HAS HITHERTO PLAYED WITH THE PUPPET MANTHIS IS THE FACT HE CANNOT CONTEMPLATE WITH EQUANIMITY MAN SHALL NOW EXPLOIT CHANCE HE SAYS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND MAKE IT FALL ON ITS KNEES BEFORE HIM SEE VERSE IN ON THE OLIVE MOUNT AND VERSES IN THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE CHAPTER XLIX THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE THIS REQUIRES SCARCELY ANY COMMENT IT IS A SATIRE ON MODERN MAN AND HIS BELITTLING VIRTUES IN VERSES AND OF THE SECOND PART OF THE DISCOURSE WE ARE REMINDED OF NIETZSCHES POWERFUL INDICTMENT OF THE GREAT OF TODAY IN THE ANTICHRIST APHORISM AT PRESENT NOBODY HAS ANY LONGER THE COURAGE FOR SEPARATE RIGHTS FOR RIGHTS OF DOMINATION FOR A FEELING OF REVERENCE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS EQUALSFOR PATHOS OF DISTANCEOUR POLITICS ARE MORBID FROM THIS WANT OF COURAGETHE ARISTOCRACY OF CHARACTER HAS BEEN UNDERMINED MOST CRAFTILY BY THE LIE OF THE EQUALITY OF SOULS AND IF THE BELIEF IN THE PRIVILEGE OF THE MANY MAKES REVOLUTIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THEM IT IS CHRISTIANITY LET US NOT DOUBT IT IT IS CHRISTIAN VALUATIONS WHICH TRANSLATE EVERY REVOLUTION MERELY INTO BLOOD AND CRIME SEE ALSO BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL PAGES NIETZSCHE THOUGHT IT WAS A BAD SIGN OF THE TIMES THAT EVEN RULERS HAVE LOST THE COURAGE OF THEIR POSITIONS AND THAT A MAN OF FREDERICK THE GREATS POWER AND DISTINGUISHED GIFTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY ICH BIN DER ERSTE DIENER DES STAATES I AM THE FIRST SERVANT OF THE STATE TO THIS UTTERANCE OF THE GREAT SOVEREIGN VERSE UNDOUBTEDLY REFERS COWARDICE AND MEDIOCRITY ARE THE NAMES WITH WHICH HE LABELS MODERN NOTIONS OF VIRTUE AND MODERATION IN PART III WE GET THE SENTIMENTS OF THE DISCOURSE IN THE HAPPY ISLES BUT PERHAPS IN STRONGER TERMS ONCE AGAIN WE FIND NIETZSCHE THOROUGHLY AT EASE IF NOT CHEERFUL AS AN ATHEIST AND SPEAKING WITH VERTIGINOUS DARING OF MAKING CHANCE GO ON ITS KNEES TO HIM IN VERSE ZARATHUSTRA MAKES YET ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT DEFINING HIS ENTIRELY ANTIANARCHICAL ATTITUDE AND UNLESS SUCH PASSAGES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY OVERLOOKED OR DELIBERATELY IGNORED HITHERTO BY THOSE WHO WILL PERSIST IN LAYING ANARCHY AT HIS DOOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE EVER BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FOUL POLITICAL PARTY THE LAST VERSE INTRODUCES THE EXPRESSION THE GREAT NOONTIDE IN THE POEM TO BE FOUND AT THE END OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL WE MEET WITH THE EXPRESSION AGAIN AND WE SHALL FIND IT OCCURRING TIME AND AGAIN IN NIETZSCHES WORKS IT WILL BE FOUND FULLY ELUCIDATED IN THE FIFTH PART OF THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS BUT FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT REFER TO THIS BOOK IT WERE WELL TO POINT OUT THAT NIETZSCHE CALLED THE PRESENT PERIODOUR PERIODTHE NOON OF MANS HISTORY DAWN IS BEHIND US THE CHILDHOOD OF MANKIND IS OVER NOW WE KNOW THERE IS NOW NO LONGER ANY EXCUSE FOR MISTAKES WHICH WILL TEND TO BOTCH AND DISFIGURE THE TYPE MAN WITH RESPECT TO WHAT IS PAST HE SAYS I HAVE LIKE ALL DISCERNING ONES GREAT TOLERATION THAT IS TO SAY GENEROUS SELFCONTROLBUT MY FEELING CHANGES SUDDENLY AND BREAKS OUT AS SOON AS I ENTER THE MODERN PERIOD OUR PERIOD OUR AGE KNOWS SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LXX CHAPTER LI ON PASSINGBY HERE WE FIND NIETZSCHE CONFRONTED WITH HIS EXTREME OPPOSITE WITH HIM THEREFORE FOR WHOM HE IS MOST FREQUENTLY MISTAKEN BY THE UNWARY ZARATHUSTRAS APE HE IS CALLED IN THE DISCOURSE HE IS ONE OF THOSE AT WHOSE HANDS NIETZSCHE HAD TO SUFFER MOST DURING HIS LIFETIME AND AT WHOSE HANDS HIS PHILOSOPHY HAS SUFFERED MOST SINCE HIS DEATH IN THIS RESPECT IT MAY SEEM A LITTLE TRIVIAL TO SPEAK OF EXTREMES MEETING BUT IT IS WONDERFULLY APT MANY HAVE ADOPTED NIETZSCHES MANNERISMS AND WORDCOINAGES WHO HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH HIM BEYOND THE IDEAS AND BUSINESS THEY PLAGIARISED BUT THE SUPERFICIAL OBSERVER AND A LARGE PORTION OF THE PUBLIC NOT KNOWING OF THESE THINGSNOT KNOWING PERHAPS THAT THERE ARE ICONOCLASTS WHO DESTROY OUT OF LOVE AND ARE THEREFORE CREATORS AND THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO DESTROY OUT OF RESENTMENT AND REVENGEFULNESS AND WHO ARE THEREFORE REVOLUTIONISTS AND ANARCHISTSARE PRONE TO CONFOUND THE TWO TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE NOBLER TYPE IF WE NOW READ WHAT THE FOOL SAYS TO ZARATHUSTRA AND NOTE THE TRICKS OF SPEECH HE HAS BORROWED FROM HIM IF WE CAREFULLY FOLLOW THE ATTITUDE HE ASSUMES WE SHALL UNDERSTAND WHY ZARATHUSTRA FINALLY INTERRUPTS HIM STOP THIS AT ONCE ZARATHUSTRA CRIES LONG HAVE THY SPEECH AND THY SPECIES DISGUSTED MEOUT OF LOVE ALONE SHALL MY CONTEMPT AND MY WARNING BIRD TAKE WING BUT NOT OUT OF THE SWAMP IT WERE WELL IF THIS DISCOURSE WERE TAKEN TO HEART BY ALL THOSE WHO ARE TOO READY TO ASSOCIATE NIETZSCHE WITH LESSER AND NOISER MENWITH MOUNTEBANKS AND MUMMERS CHAPTER LII THE APOSTATES IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS APPLIES TO ALL THOSE BREATHLESS AND HASTY TASTERS OF EVERYTHING WHO PLUNGE TOO RASHLY INTO THE SEA OF INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND HERESY AND WHO HAVING MISCALCULATED THEIR STRENGTH FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THEIR HEAD ABOVE WATER A LITTLE OLDER A LITTLE COLDER SAYS NIETZSCHE THEY SOON CLAMBER BACK TO THE CONVENTIONS OF THE AGE THEY INTENDED REFORMING THE FRENCH THEN SAY LE DIABLE SE FAIT HERMITE BUT THESE MEN AS A RULE HAVE NEVER BEEN DEVILS NEITHER DO THEY BECOME ANGELS FOR IN ORDER TO BE REALLY GOOD OR EVIL SOME STRENGTH AND DEEP BREATHING IS REQUIRED THOSE WHO ARE MORE INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING ORTHODOXY THAN IN BEING OVER NICE CONCERNING THE KIND OF SUPPORT THEY GIVE IT OFTEN REFER TO THESE PEOPLE AS EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF THE TRUE FAITH CHAPTER LIII THE RETURN HOME THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A CLASS OF WRITING WHICH MAY BE PASSED OVER TOO LIGHTLY BY THOSE WHOM POETASTERS HAVE MADE DISTRUSTFUL OF POETRY FROM FIRST TO LAST IT IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE AS AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOTE THE INEVITABLE SUPERFICIALITY OF THE RABBLE IS CONTRASTED WITH THE PEACEFUL AND PROFOUND DEPTHS OF THE ANCHORITE HERE WE FIRST GET A DIRECT HINT CONCERNING NIETZSCHES FUNDAMENTAL PASSIONTHE MAIN FORCE BEHIND ALL HIS NEW VALUES AND SCATHING CRITICISM OF EXISTING VALUES IN VERSE WE ARE TOLD THAT PITY WAS HIS GREATEST DANGER THE BROAD ALTRUISM OF THE LAWGIVER THINKING OVER VAST ERAS OF TIME WAS CONTINUALLY BEING PITTED BY NIETZSCHE IN HIMSELF AGAINST THAT TRANSIENT AND MEANER SYMPATHY FOR THE NEIGHBOUR WHICH HE MORE PERHAPS THAN ANY OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HAD SUFFERED FROM BUT WHICH HE WAS CERTAIN INVOLVED ENORMOUS DANGERS NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT ALSO TO THE NEXT AND SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS SEE NOTE B WHERE PITY IS MENTIONED AMONG THE DEGENERATE VIRTUES LATER IN THE BOOK WE SHALL SEE HOW HIS PROFOUND COMPASSION LEADS HIM INTO TEMPTATION AND HOW FRANTICALLY HE STRUGGLES AGAINST IT IN VERSES AND HE TELLS US TO WHAT EXTENT HE HAD TO MODIFY HIMSELF IN ORDER TO BE ENDURED BY HIS FELLOWS WHOM HE LOVED SEE ALSO VERSE IN MANLY PRUDENCE NIETZSCHES GREAT LOVE FOR HIS FELLOWS WHICH HE CONFESSES IN THE PROLOGUE AND WHICH IS AT THE ROOT OF ALL HIS TEACHING SEEMS RATHER TO ELUDE THE DISCERNING POWERS OF THE AVERAGE PHILANTHROPIST AND MODERN MAN HE CANNOT SEE THE WOOD FOR THE TREES A PHILANTHROPY THAT SACRIFICES THE MINORITY OF THE PRESENTDAY FOR THE MAJORITY CONSTITUTING POSTERITY COMPLETELY EVADES HIS MENTAL GRASP AND NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE IT DECLARES CHRISTIAN VALUES TO BE A DANGER TO THE FUTURE OF OUR KIND IS THEREFORE SHELVED AS BRUTAL COLD AND HARD SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER XXXVI NIETZSCHE TRIED TO BE ALL THINGS TO ALL MEN HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY FOND OF HIS FELLOWS FOR THAT IN THE RETURN HOME HE DESCRIBES HOW HE ULTIMATELY RETURNS TO LONELINESS IN ORDER TO RECOVER FROM THE EFFECTS OF HIS EXPERIMENT CHAPTER LIV THE THREE EVIL THINGS NIETZSCHE IS HERE COMPLETELY IN HIS ELEMENT THREE THINGS HITHERTO BESTCURSED AND MOST CALUMNIATED ON EARTH ARE BROUGHT FORWARD TO BE WEIGHED VOLUPTUOUSNESS THIRST OF POWER AND SELFISHNESSTHE THREE FORCES IN HUMANITY WHICH CHRISTIANITY HAS DONE MOST TO GARBLE AND BESMIRCHNIETZSCHE ENDEAVOURS TO REINSTATE IN THEIR FORMER PLACES OF HONOUR VOLUPTUOUSNESS OR SENSUAL PLEASURE IS A DANGEROUS THING TO DISCUSS NOWADAYS IF WE MENTION IT WITH FAVOUR WE MAY BE REGARDED HOWEVER UNJUSTLY AS THE ADVOCATE OF SAVAGES SATYRS AND PURE SENSUALITY IF WE CONDEMN IT WE EITHER GO OVER TO THE PURITANS OR WE JOIN THOSE WHO ARE WONT TO COME TO TABLE WITH NO EDGE TO THEIR APPETITES AND WHO THEREFORE GRUMBLE AT ALL GOOD FARE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE VALUE OF HEALTHY INNOCENT VOLUPTUOUSNESS LIKE THE VALUE OF HEALTH ITSELF MUST HAVE BEEN GREATLY DISCOUNTED BY ALL THOSE WHO RESENTING THEIR INABILITY TO PARTAKE OF THIS WORLDS GOODS CRIED LIKE ST PAUL I WOULD THAT ALL MEN WERE EVEN AS I MYSELF NOW NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY MIGHT BE CALLED AN ATTEMPT AT GIVING BACK TO HEALTHY AND NORMAL MEN INNOCENCE AND A CLEAN CONSCIENCE IN THEIR DESIRESNOT TO APPLAUD THE VULGAR SENSUALISTS WHO RESPOND TO EVERY STIMULUS AND WHOSE PASSIONS ARE OUT OF HAND NOT TO TELL THE MEAN SELFISH INDIVIDUAL WHOSE SELFISHNESS IS A POLLUTION SEE APHORISM TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS THAT HE IS RIGHT NOR TO ASSURE THE WEAK THE SICK AND THE CRIPPLED THAT THE THIRST OF POWER WHICH THEY GRATIFY BY EXPLOITING THE HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER INDIVIDUALS IS JUSTIFIEDBUT TO SAVE THE CLEAN HEALTHY MAN FROM THE VALUES OF THOSE AROUND HIM WHO LOOK AT EVERYTHING THROUGH THE MUD THAT IS IN THEIR OWN BODIESTO GIVE HIM AND HIM ALONE A CLEAN CONSCIENCE IN HIS MANHOOD AND THE DESIRES OF HIS MANHOOD DO I COUNSEL YOU TO SLAY YOUR INSTINCTS I COUNSEL TO INNOCENCE IN YOUR INSTINCTS IN VERSE OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH AS IN VERSE I OF PARAGRAPH IN THE OLD AND NEW TABLES NIETZSCHE GIVES US A REASON FOR HIS OCCASIONAL OBSCURITY SEE ALSO VERSES TO OF POETS AS I HAVE ALREADY POINTED OUT HIS PHILOSOPHY IS QUITE ESOTERIC IT CAN SERVE NO PURPOSE WITH THE ORDINARY MEDIOCRE TYPE OF MAN I PERSONALLY CAN NO LONGER HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT NIETZSCHES ONLY OBJECT IN THAT PART OF HIS PHILOSOPHY WHERE HE BIDS HIS FRIENDS STAND BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL WITH HIM WAS TO SAVE HIGHER MEN WHOSE GROWTH AND SCOPE MIGHT BE LIMITED BY THE TOO STRICT OBSERVANCE OF MODERN VALUES FROM FOUNDERING ON THE ROCKS OF A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THEIR OWN GENIUS AND TRADITIONAL CONVENTIONS THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY IN WHICH THE GREAT MAN CAN ACHIEVE GREATNESS IS BY MEANS OF EXCEPTIONAL FREEDOMTHE FREEDOM WHICH ASSISTS HIM IN EXPERIENCING HIMSELF VERSES TO AFFORD AN EXCELLENT SUPPLEMENT TO NIETZSCHES DESCRIPTION OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE NOBLE TYPE TOWARDS THE SLAVES IN APHORISM OF THE WORK BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL SEE ALSO NOTE B CHAPTER LV THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER XLVI IN PART II OF THIS DISCOURSE WE MEET WITH A DOCTRINE NOT TOUCHED UPON HITHERTO SAVE INDIRECTLYI REFER TO THE DOCTRINE OF SELFLOVE WE SHOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS PERFECTLY BEFORE PROCEEDING FOR IT IS PRECISELY VIEWS OF THIS SORT WHICH AFTER HAVING BEEN CUT OUT OF THE ORIGINAL CONTEXT ARE REPEATED FAR AND WIDE AS INTERNAL EVIDENCE PROVING THE GENERAL UNSOUNDNESS OF NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY ALREADY IN THE LAST OF THE THOUGHTS OUT OF SEASON NIETZSCHE SPEAKS AS FOLLOWS ABOUT MODERN MEN THESE MODERN CREATURES WISH RATHER TO BE HUNTED DOWN WOUNDED AND TORN TO SHREDS THAN TO LIVE ALONE WITH THEMSELVES IN SOLITARY CALM ALONE WITH ONESELFTHIS THOUGHT TERRIFIES THE MODERN SOUL IT IS HIS ONE ANXIETY HIS ONE GHASTLY FEAR ENGLISH EDITION PAGE IN HIS FEVERISH SCURRY TO FIND ENTERTAINMENT AND DIVERSION WHETHER IN A NOVEL A NEWSPAPER OR A PLAY THE MODERN MAN CONDEMNS HIS OWN AGE UTTERLY FOR HE SHOWS THAT IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS HE DESPISES HIMSELF ONE CANNOT CHANGE A CONDITION OF THIS SORT IN A DAY TO BECOME ENDURABLE TO ONESELF AN INNER TRANSFORMATION IS NECESSARY TOO LONG HAVE WE LOST OURSELVES IN OUR FRIENDS AND ENTERTAINMENTS TO BE ABLE TO FIND OURSELVES SO SOON AT ANOTHERS BIDDING AND VERILY IT IS NO COMMANDMENT FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW TO LEARN TO LOVE ONESELF RATHER IS IT OF ALL ARTS THE FINEST SUBTLEST LAST AND PATIENTEST IN THE LAST VERSE NIETZSCHE CHALLENGES US TO SHOW THAT OUR WAY IS THE RIGHT WAY IN HIS TEACHING HE DOES NOT COERCE US NOR DOES HE OVERPERSUADE HE SIMPLY SAYS I AM A LAW ONLY FOR MINE OWN I AM NOT A LAW FOR ALL THISIS NOW MY WAYWHERE IS YOURS CHAPTER LVI OLD AND NEW TABLES PAR NIETZSCHE HIMSELF DECLARES THIS TO BE THE MOST DECISIVE PORTION OF THE WHOLE OF THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA IT IS A SORT OF EPITOME OF HIS LEADING DOCTRINES IN VERSE OF THE SECOND PARAGRAPH WE LEARN HOW HE HIMSELF WOULD FAIN HAVE ABANDONED THE POETICAL METHOD OF EXPRESSION HAD HE NOT KNOWN ONLY TOO WELL THAT THE ONLY CHANCE A NEW DOCTRINE HAS OF SURVIVING NOWADAYS DEPENDS UPON ITS BEING GIVEN TO THE WORLD IN SOME KIND OF ARTFORM JUST AS PROPHETS CENTURIES AGO OFTEN HAD TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE MASK OF MADNESS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE HATRED OF THOSE WHO DID NOT AND COULD NOT SEE AS THEY DID SO TODAY THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE AMONG OPINIONS AND VALUES IS SO GREAT THAT AN ARTFORM IS PRACTICALLY THE ONLY GARB IN WHICH A NEW PHILOSOPHY CAN DARE TO INTRODUCE ITSELF TO US PARS AND MANY OF THE PARAGRAPHS WILL BE FOUND TO BE MERELY REMINISCENT OF FORMER DISCOURSES FOR INSTANCE PAR RECALLS REDEMPTION THE LAST VERSE OF PAR IS IMPORTANT FREEDOM WHICH AS I HAVE POINTED OUT BEFORE NIETZSCHE CONSIDERED A DANGEROUS ACQUISITION IN INEXPERIENCED OR UNWORTHY HANDS HERE RECEIVES ITS DEATHBLOW AS A GENERAL DESIDERATUM IN THE FIRST PART WE READ UNDER THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE THAT FREEDOM AS AN END IN ITSELF DOES NOT CONCERN ZARATHUSTRA AT ALL HE SAYS THERE FREE FROM WHAT WHAT DOTH THAT MATTER TO ZARATHUSTRA CLEARLY HOWEVER SHALL THINE EYE ANSWER ME FREE FOR WHAT AND IN THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE AH THAT YE UNDERSTOOD MY WORD DO EVER WHAT YE WILLBUT FIRST BE SUCH AS CAN WILL PAR HERE WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE KIND OF ALTRUISM NIETZSCHE EXACTED FROM HIGHER MEN IT IS REALLY A COMMENT UPON THE BESTOWING VIRTUE SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER XXII PAR THIS REFERS OF COURSE TO THE RECEPTION PIONEERS OF NIETZSCHES STAMP MEET WITH AT THE HANDS OF THEIR CONTEMPORARIES PAR NIETZSCHE TEACHES THAT NOTHING IS STABLENOT EVEN VALUESNOT EVEN THE CONCEPTS GOOD AND EVIL HE LIKENS LIFE UNTO A STREAM BUT FOOTBRIDGES AND RAILINGS SPAN THE STREAM AND THEY SEEM TO STAND FIRM MANY WILL BE REMINDED OF GOOD AND EVIL WHEN THEY LOOK UPON THESE STRUCTURES FOR THUS THESE SAME VALUES STAND OVER THE STREAM OF LIFE AND LIFE FLOWS ON BENEATH THEM AND LEAVES THEM STANDING WHEN HOWEVER WINTER COMES AND THE STREAM GETS FROZEN MANY INQUIRE SHOULD NOT EVERYTHINGSTAND STILL FUNDAMENTALLY EVERYTHING STANDETH STILL BUT SOON THE SPRING COMETH AND WITH IT THE THAWWIND IT BREAKS THE ICE AND THE ICE BREAKS DOWN THE FOOTBRIDGES AND RAILINGS WHEREUPON EVERYTHING IS SWEPT AWAY THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS ACCORDING TO NIETZSCHE HAS NOW BEEN REACHED OH MY BRETHREN IS NOT EVERYTHING AT PRESENT IN FLUX HAVE NOT ALL RAILINGS AND FOOTBRIDGES FALLEN INTO THE WATER WHO WOULD STILL HOLD ON TO GOOD AND EVIL PAR THIS IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THE FIRST THREE VERSES OF PAR PAR SO FAR THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT PARAGRAPH IT IS A PROTEST AGAINST READING A MORAL ORDER OF THINGS IN LIFE LIFE IS SOMETHING ESSENTIALLY IMMORAL NIETZSCHE TELLS US IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY EVEN TO CALL LIFE ACTIVITY OR TO DEFINE IT FURTHER AS THE CONTINUOUS ADJUSTMENT OF INTERNAL RELATIONS TO EXTERNAL RELATIONS AS SPENCER HAS IT NIETZSCHE CHARACTERISES AS A DEMOCRATIC IDIOSYNCRACY HE SAYS TO DEFINE IT IN THIS WAY IS TO MISTAKE THE TRUE NATURE AND FUNCTION OF LIFE WHICH IS WILL TO POWERLIFE IS ESSENTIALLY APPROPRIATION INJURY CONQUEST OF THE STRANGE AND WEAK SUPPRESSION SEVERITY OBTRUSION OF ITS OWN FORMS INCORPORATION AND AT LEAST PUTTING IT MILDEST EXPLOITATION ADAPTATION IS MERELY A SECONDARY ACTIVITY A MERE REACTIVITY SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII PARS THESE DEAL WITH NIETZSCHES PRINCIPLE OF THE DESIRABILITY OF REARING A SELECT RACE THE BIOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL GROUNDS FOR HIS INSISTENCE UPON THIS PRINCIPLE ARE OF COURSE MANIFOLD GOBINEAU IN HIS GREAT WORK LINEGALITE DES RACES HUMAINES LAYS STRONG EMPHASIS UPON THE EVILS WHICH ARISE FROM PROMISCUOUS AND INTERSOCIAL MARRIAGES HE ALONE WOULD SUFFICE TO CARRY NIETZSCHES POINT AGAINST ALL THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THE OTHER CONDITIONS TO THE CONDITIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE SAVED ROME WHICH HAVE MAINTAINED THE STRENGTH OF THE JEWISH RACE AND WHICH ARE STRICTLY MAINTAINED BY EVERY BREEDER OF ANIMALS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD DARWIN IN HIS REMARKS RELATIVE TO THE DEGENERATION OF CULTIVATED TYPES OF ANIMALS THROUGH THE ACTION OF PROMISCUOUS BREEDING BRINGS GOBINEAU SUPPORT FROM THE REALM OF BIOLOGY THE LAST TWO VERSES OF PAR WERE DISCUSSED IN THE NOTES ON CHAPTERS XXXVI AND LIII PAR THIS LIKE THE FIRST PART OF THE SOOTHSAYER IS OBVIOUSLY A REFERENCE TO THE SCHOPENHAUERIAN PESSIMISM PARS THESE ARE SUPPLEMENTARY TO THE DISCOURSE BACKWORLDSMEN PAR WE MUST BE CAREFUL TO SEPARATE THIS PARAGRAPH IN SENSE FROM THE PREVIOUS FOUR PARAGRAPHS NIETZSCHE IS STILL DEALING WITH PESSIMISM HERE BUT IT IS THE PESSIMISM OF THE HEROTHE MAN MOST SUSCEPTIBLE OF ALL TO DESPERATE VIEWS OF LIFE OWING TO THE OBSTACLES THAT ARE ARRAYED AGAINST HIM IN A WORLD WHERE MEN OF HIS KIND ARE VERY RARE AND ARE CONTINUALLY BEING SACRIFICED IT WAS TO SAVE THIS MAN THAT NIETZSCHE WROTE HEROISM FOILED THWARTED AND WRECKED HOPING AND FIGHTING UNTIL THE LAST IS AT LENGTH OVERTAKEN BY DESPAIR AND RENOUNCES ALL STRUGGLE FOR SLEEP THIS IS NOT THE NATURAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL PESSIMISM WHICH PROCEEDS FROM AN UNHEALTHY BODYTHE DYSPEPTICS LACK OF APPETITE IT IS RATHER THE DESPERATION OF THE NETTED LION THAT ULTIMATELY STOPS ALL MOVEMENT BECAUSE THE MORE IT MOVES THE MORE INVOLVED IT BECOMES PAR ALL THAT INCREASES POWER IS GOOD ALL THAT SPRINGS FROM WEAKNESS IS BAD THE WEAK AND ILLCONSTITUTED SHALL PERISH FIRST PRINCIPLE OF OUR CHARITY AND ONE SHALL ALSO HELP THEM THERETO NIETZSCHE PARTLY DIVINED THE KIND OF RECEPTION MORAL VALUES OF THIS STAMP WOULD MEET WITH AT THE HANDS OF THE EFFEMINATE MANHOOD OF EUROPE HERE WE SEE THAT HE HAD ANTICIPATED THE MOST LIKELY FORM THEIR CRITICISM WOULD TAKE SEE ALSO THE LAST TWO VERSES OF PAR PAR THE FIRST TEN VERSES HERE ARE REMINISCENT OF WAR AND WARRIORS AND OF THE FLIES IN THE MARKETPLACE VERSES AND HOWEVER ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THERE IS A STRONG ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF THE SHARP DIFFERENTIATION OF CASTES AND OF RACES AND EVEN OF SEXES SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER XVIII RUNNING ALL THROUGH NIETZSCHES WRITINGS BUT SHARP DIFFERENTIATION ALSO IMPLIES ANTAGONISM IN SOME FORM OR OTHERHENCE NIETZSCHES FEARS FOR MODERN MEN WHAT MODERN MEN DESIRE ABOVE ALL IS PEACE AND THE CESSATION OF PAIN BUT NEITHER GREAT RACES NOR GREAT CASTES HAVE EVER BEEN BUILT UP IN THIS WAY WHO STILL WANTETH TO RULE ZARATHUSTRA ASKS IN THE PROLOGUE WHO STILL WANTETH TO OBEY BOTH ARE TOO BURDENSOME THIS IS RAPIDLY BECOMING EVERYBODYS ATTITUDE TODAY THE TAME MORAL READING OF THE FACE OF NATURE TOGETHER WITH SUCH DEMOCRATIC INTERPRETATIONS OF LIFE AS THOSE SUGGESTED BY HERBERT SPENCER ARE SIGNS OF A PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION WHICH IS THE REVERSE OF THAT BOUNDING AND IRRESPONSIBLE HEALTHINESS IN WHICH HARDER AND MORE TRAGIC VALUES RULE PAR THIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH CHILD AND MARRIAGE IN THE FIFTH VERSE WE SHALL RECOGNISE OUR OLD FRIEND MARRIAGE ON THE TENYEARS SYSTEM WHICH GEORGE MEREDITH SUGGESTED SOME YEARS AGO THIS HOWEVER MUST NOT BE TAKEN TOO LITERALLY I DO NOT THINK NIETZSCHES PROFOUNDEST VIEWS ON MARRIAGE WERE EVER INTENDED TO BE GIVEN OVER TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL AT LEAST NOT FOR THE PRESENT THEY APPEAR IN THE BIOGRAPHY BY HIS SISTER AND ALTHOUGH THEIR WISDOM IS UNQUESTIONABLE THE NATURE OF THE REFORMS HE SUGGESTS RENDER IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO BECOME POPULAR JUST NOW PARS SEE NOTE ON THE PROLOGUE PAR NIETZSCHE WAS NOT AN ICONOCLAST FROM PREDILECTION NO BITTERNESS OR EMPTY HATE DICTATED HIS VITUPERATIONS AGAINST EXISTING VALUES AND AGAINST THE DOGMAS OF HIS PARENTS AND FOREFATHERS HE KNEW TOO WELL WHAT THESE THINGS MEANT TO THE MILLIONS WHO PROFESS THEM TO APPROACH THE TASK OF UPROOTING THEM WITH LEVITY OR EVEN WITH HASTE HE SAW WHAT MODERN ANARCHISTS AND REVOLUTIONISTS DO NOT SEENAMELY THAT MAN IS IN DANGER OF ACTUAL DESTRUCTION WHEN HIS CUSTOMS AND VALUES ARE BROKEN I NEED HARDLY POINT OUT THEREFORE HOW DEEPLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF THE RESPONSIBILITY HE THREW UPON OUR SHOULDERS WHEN HE INVITED US TO RECONSIDER OUR POSITION THE LINES IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE EVIDENCE ENOUGH OF HIS EARNESTNESS CHAPTER LVII THE CONVALESCENT WE MEET WITH SEVERAL PUZZLES HERE ZARATHUSTRA CALLS HIMSELF THE ADVOCATE OF THE CIRCLE THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE OF ALL THINGS AND HE CALLS THIS DOCTRINE HIS ABYSMAL THOUGHT IN THE LAST VERSE OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH HOWEVER AFTER HAILING HIS DEEPEST THOUGHT HE CRIES DISGUST DISGUST DISGUST WE KNOW NIETZSCHES IDEAL MAN WAS THAT WORLDAPPROVING EXUBERANT AND VIVACIOUS CREATURE WHO HAS NOT ONLY LEARNT TO COMPROMISE AND ARRANGE WITH THAT WHICH WAS AND IS BUT WISHES TO HAVE IT AGAIN AS IT WAS AND IS FOR ALL ETERNITY INSATIABLY CALLING OUT DA CAPO NOT ONLY TO HIMSELF BUT TO THE WHOLE PIECE AND PLAY SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER XLII BUT IF ONE ASK ONESELF WHAT THE CONDITIONS TO SUCH AN ATTITUDE ARE ONE WILL REALISE IMMEDIATELY HOW UTTERLY DIFFERENT NIETZSCHE WAS FROM HIS IDEAL THE MAN WHO INSATIABLY CRIES DA CAPO TO HIMSELF AND TO THE WHOLE OF HIS MISEENSCENE MUST BE IN A POSITION TO DESIRE EVERY INCIDENT IN HIS LIFE TO BE REPEATED NOT ONCE BUT AGAIN AND AGAIN ETERNALLY NOW NIETZSCHES LIFE HAD BEEN TOO FULL OF DISAPPOINTMENTS ILLNESS UNSUCCESSFUL STRUGGLES AND SNUBS TO ALLOW OF HIS THINKING OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE WITHOUT LOATHINGHENCE PROBABLY THE WORDS OF THE LAST VERSE IN VERSES AND WE HAVE NIETZSCHE DECLARING HIMSELF AN EVOLUTIONIST IN THE BROADEST SENSETHAT IS TO SAY THAT HE BELIEVES IN THE DEVELOPMENT HYPOTHESIS AS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS BY WHICH SPECIES HAVE ORIGINATED NOW TO UNDERSTAND HIS POSITION CORRECTLY WE MUST SHOW HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE TWO GREATEST OF MODERN EVOLUTIONISTSDARWIN AND SPENCER AS A PHILOSOPHER HOWEVER NIETZSCHE DOES NOT STAND OR FALL BY HIS OBJECTIONS TO THE DARWINIAN OR SPENCERIAN COSMOGONY HE NEVER LAID CLAIM TO A VERY PROFOUND KNOWLEDGE OF BIOLOGY AND HIS CRITICISM IS FAR MORE VALUABLE AS THE ATTITUDE OF A FRESH MIND THAN AS THAT OF A SPECIALIST TOWARDS THE QUESTION MOREOVER IN HIS OBJECTIONS MANY DIFFICULTIES ARE RAISED WHICH ARE NOT SETTLED BY AN APPEAL TO EITHER OF THE MEN ABOVE MENTIONED WE HAVE GIVEN NIETZSCHES DEFINITION OF LIFE IN THE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVI PAR STILL THERE REMAINS A HOPE THAT DARWIN AND NIETZSCHE MAY SOME DAY BECOME RECONCILED BY A NEW DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESSES BY WHICH VARIETIES OCCUR THE APPEARANCE OF VARIETIES AMONG ANIMALS AND OF SPORTING PLANTS IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM IS STILL SHROUDED IN MYSTERY AND THE QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS NOT PRECISELY THE GROUND ON WHICH DARWIN AND NIETZSCHE WILL MEET IS AN INTERESTING ONE THE FORMER SAYS IN HIS ORIGIN OF SPECIES CONCERNING THE CAUSES OF VARIABILITY THERE ARE TWO FACTORS NAMELY THE NATURE OF THE ORGANISM AND THE NATURE OF THE CONDITIONS THE FORMER SEEMS TO BE MUCH THE MORE IMPORTANT THE ITALICS ARE MINE FOR NEARLY SIMILAR VARIATIONS SOMETIMES ARISE UNDER AS FAR AS WE CAN JUDGE DISSIMILAR CONDITIONS AND ON THE OTHER HAND DISSIMILAR VARIATIONS ARISE UNDER CONDITIONS WHICH APPEAR TO BE NEARLY UNIFORM NIETZSCHE RECOGNISING THIS SAME TRUTH WOULD ASCRIBE PRACTICALLY ALL THE IMPORTANCE TO THE HIGHEST FUNCTIONARIES IN THE ORGANISM IN WHICH THE LIFEWILL APPEARS AS AN ACTIVE AND FORMATIVE PRINCIPLE AND EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CASES WHERE PASSIVE ORGANISMS ALONE ARE CONCERNED WOULD NOT GIVE SUCH A PROMINENT PLACE TO THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT ADAPTATION ACCORDING TO HIM IS MERELY A SECONDARY ACTIVITY A MERE REACTIVITY AND HE IS THEREFORE QUITE OPPOSED TO SPENCERS DEFINITION LIFE IS THE CONTINUOUS ADJUSTMENT OF INTERNAL RELATIONS TO EXTERNAL RELATIONS AGAIN IN THE MOTIVE FORCE BEHIND ANIMAL AND PLANT LIFE NIETZSCHE DISAGREES WITH DARWIN HE TRANSFORMS THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCETHE PASSIVE AND INVOLUNTARY CONDITIONINTO THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER WHICH IS ACTIVE AND CREATIVE AND MUCH MORE IN HARMONY WITH DARWINS OWN VIEW GIVEN ABOVE CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ORGANISM ITSELF THE CHANGE IS ONE OF SUCH FARREACHING IMPORTANCE THAT WE CANNOT DISPOSE OF IT IN A BREATH AS A MERE PLAY UPON WORDS MUCH IS RECKONED HIGHER THAN LIFE ITSELF BY THE LIVING ONE NIETZSCHE SAYS THAT TO SPEAK OF THE ACTIVITY OF LIFE AS A STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IS TO STATE THE CASE INADEQUATELY HE WARNS US NOT TO CONFOUND MALTHUS WITH NATURE THERE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ORGANIC BEINGS ON THIS EARTH WANT WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BRING THIS STRUGGLE ABOUT IS NOT SO COMMON AS IS SUPPOSED SOME OTHER FORCE MUST BE OPERATIVE THE WILL TO POWER IS THIS FORCE THE INSTINCT OF SELFPRESERVATION IS ONLY ONE OF THE INDIRECT AND MOST FREQUENT RESULTS THEREOF A CERTAIN LACK OF ACUMEN IN PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONS AND THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN ENGLAND AT THE TIME DARWIN WROTE MAY BOTH ACCORDING TO NIETZSCHE HAVE INDUCED THE RENOWNED NATURALIST TO DESCRIBE THE FORCES OF NATURE AS HE DID IN HIS ORIGIN OF SPECIES IN VERSES AND OF THE SECOND PORTION OF THIS DISCOURSE WE MEET WITH A DOCTRINE WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT SEEMS TO BE MERELY LE MANOIR A LENVERS INDEED ONE ENGLISH CRITIC HAS ACTUALLY SAID OF NIETZSCHE THAT THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA IS NO MORE THAN A COMPENDIUM OF MODERN VIEWS AND MAXIMS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN EXAMINING THESE HETERODOX PRONOUNCEMENTS A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY HOWEVER WE MAY POSSIBLY PERCEIVE THEIR TRUTH REGARDING GOOD AND EVIL AS PURELY RELATIVE VALUES IT STANDS TO REASON THAT WHAT MAY BE BAD OR EVIL IN A GIVEN MAN RELATIVE TO A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENT MAY ACTUALLY BE GOOD IF NOT HIGHLY VIRTUOUS IN HIM RELATIVE TO A CERTAIN OTHER ENVIRONMENT IF THIS HYPOTHETICAL MAN REPRESENT THE ASCENDING LINE OF LIFETHAT IS TO SAY IF HE PROMISE ALL THAT WHICH IS HIGHEST IN A GRAECOROMAN SENSE THEN IT IS LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE CONDEMNED AS WICKED IF INTRODUCED INTO THE SOCIETY OF MEN REPRESENTING THE OPPOSITE AND DESCENDING LINE OF LIFE BY DEPRIVING A MAN OF HIS WICKEDNESSMORE PARTICULARLY NOWADAYS THEREFORE ONE MAY UNWITTINGLY BE DOING VIOLENCE TO THE GREATEST IN HIM IT MAY BE AN OUTRAGE AGAINST HIS WHOLENESS JUST AS THE LOPPINGOFF OF A LEG WOULD BE FORTUNATELY THE NATURAL SOCALLED WICKEDNESS OF HIGHER MEN HAS IN A CERTAIN MEASURE BEEN ABLE TO RESIST THIS LOPPING PROCESS WHICH SUCCESSIVE SLAVEMORALITIES HAVE PRACTISED BUT SIGNS ARE NOT WANTING WHICH SHOW THAT THE NOBLEST WICKEDNESS IS FAST VANISHING FROM SOCIETYTHE WICKEDNESS OF COURAGE AND DETERMINATIONAND THAT NIETZSCHE HAD GOOD REASONS FOR CRYING AH THAT MANS BADDEST IS SO VERY SMALL AH THAT HIS BEST IS SO VERY SMALL WHAT IS GOOD TO BE BRAVE IS GOOD IT IS THE GOOD WAR WHICH HALLOWETH EVERY CAUSE SEE ALSO PAR HIGHER MAN CHAPTER LX THE SEVEN SEALS THIS IS A FINAL PAEAN WHICH ZARATHUSTRA SINGS TO ETERNITY AND THE MARRIAGERING OF RINGS THE RING OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE PART IV IN MY OPINION THIS PART IS NIETZSCHES OPEN AVOWAL THAT ALL HIS PHILOSOPHY TOGETHER WITH ALL HIS HOPES ENTHUSIASTIC OUTBURSTS BLASPHEMIES PROLIXITIES AND OBSCURITIES WERE MERELY SO MANY GIFTS LAID AT THE FEET OF HIGHER MEN HE HAD NO DESIRE TO SAVE THE WORLD WHAT HE WISHED TO DETERMINE WAS WHO IS TO BE MASTER OF THE WORLD THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT THING HE CAME TO SAVE HIGHER MENTO GIVE THEM THAT FREEDOM BY WHICH ALONE THEY CAN DEVELOP AND REACH THEIR ZENITH SEE NOTE ON CHAPTER LIV END IT HAS BEEN ARGUED AND WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE THAT NO SUCH PHILOSOPHY IS REQUIRED BY HIGHER MEN THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT HIGHER MEN BY VIRTUE OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONS ALWAYS DO STAND BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL AND NEVER ALLOW ANYTHING TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THEIR COMPLETE GROWTH NIETZSCHE HOWEVER WAS EVIDENTLY NOT SO CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE ARGUED THAT WE ONLY SEE THE SUCCESSFUL CASES BEING A GREAT MAN HIMSELF HE WAS WELL AWARE OF THE DANGERS THREATENING GREATNESS IN OUR AGE IN BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL HE WRITES THERE ARE FEW PAINS SO GRIEVOUS AS TO HAVE SEEN DIVINED OR EXPERIENCED HOW AN EXCEPTIONAL MAN HAS MISSED HIS WAY AND DETERIORATED HE KNEW FROM HIS PAINFULLEST RECOLLECTIONS ON WHAT WRETCHED OBSTACLES PROMISING DEVELOPMENTS OF THE HIGHEST RANK HAVE HITHERTO USUALLY GONE TO PIECES BROKEN DOWN SUNK AND BECOME CONTEMPTIBLE NOW IN PART IV WE SHALL FIND THAT HIS STRONGEST TEMPTATION TO DESCEND TO THE FEELING OF PITY FOR HIS CONTEMPORARIES IS THE CRY FOR HELP WHICH HE HEARS FROM THE LIPS OF THE HIGHER MEN EXPOSED TO THE DREADFUL DANGER OF THEIR MODERN ENVIRONMENT CHAPTER LXI THE HONEY SACRIFICE IN THE FOURTEENTH VERSE OF THIS DISCOURSE NIETZSCHE DEFINES THE SOLEMN DUTY HE IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF BECOME WHAT THOU ART SURELY THE CRITICISM WHICH HAS BEEN DIRECTED AGAINST THIS MAXIM MUST ALL FALL TO THE GROUND WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT NIETZSCHES TEACHING WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE OTHER THAN AN ESOTERIC ONE I AM A LAW ONLY FOR MINE OWN HE SAYS EMPHATICALLY I AM NOT A LAW FOR ALL IT IS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE TO HUMANITY THAT ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ATTAIN TO THEIR FULL DEVELOPMENT FOR ONLY BY MEANS OF ITS HEROES CAN THE HUMAN RACE BE LED FORWARD STEP BY STEP TO HIGHER AND YET HIGHER LEVELS BECOME WHAT THOU ART APPLIED TO ALL OF COURSE BECOMES A VICIOUS MAXIM IT IS TO BE HOPED HOWEVER THAT WE MAY LEARN IN TIME THAT THE SAME ACTION PERFORMED BY A GIVEN NUMBER OF MEN LOSES ITS IDENTITY PRECISELY THAT SAME NUMBER OF TIMESQUOD LICET JOVI NON LICET BOVI AT THE LAST EIGHT VERSES MANY READERS MAY BE TEMPTED TO LAUGH IN ENGLAND WE ALMOST ALWAYS LAUGH WHEN A MAN TAKES HIMSELF SERIOUSLY AT ANYTHING SAVE SPORT AND THERE IS OF COURSE NO REASON WHY THE READER SHOULD NOT BE HILARIOUSA CERTAIN GREATNESS IS REQUISITE BOTH IN ORDER TO BE SUBLIME AND TO HAVE REVERENCE FOR THE SUBLIME NIETZSCHE EARNESTLY BELIEVED THAT THE ZARATHUSTRAKINGDOMHIS DYNASTY OF A THOUSAND YEARSWOULD ONE DAY COME IF HE HAD NOT BELIEVED IT SO EARNESTLY IF EVERY ARTIST IN FACT HAD NOT BELIEVED SO EARNESTLY IN HIS HAZAR WHETHER OF TEN FIFTEEN A HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND YEARS WE SHOULD HAVE LOST ALL OUR HIGHER MEN THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME PESSIMISTS SUICIDES OR MERCHANTS IF THE MINOR POET AND PHILOSOPHER HAS MADE US SHY OF THE PROPHETIC SERIOUSNESS WHICH CHARACTERIZED AN ISAIAH OR A JEREMIAH IT IS SURELY OUR LOSS AND THE MINOR POETS GAIN CHAPTER LXII THE CRY OF DISTRESS WE NOW MEET WITH ZARATHUSTRA IN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HE IS CONFRONTED WITH SCHOPENHAUER AND TEMPTED BY THE OLD SOOTHSAYER TO COMMIT THE SIN OF PITY I HAVE COME THAT I MAY SEDUCE THEE TO THY LAST SIN SAYS THE SOOTHSAYER TO ZARATHUSTRA IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT IN SCHOPENHAUERS ETHICS PITY IS ELEVATED TO THE HIGHEST PLACE AMONG THE VIRTUES AND VERY CONSISTENTLY TOO SEEING THAT THE WELTANSCHAUUNG IS A PESSIMISTIC ONE SCHOPENHAUER APPEALS TO NIETZSCHES DEEPEST AND STRONGEST SENTIMENTHIS SYMPATHY FOR HIGHER MEN WHY DOST THOU CONCEAL THYSELF HE CRIES IT IS THE HIGHER MAN THAT CALLETH FOR THEE ZARATHUSTRA IS ALMOST OVERCOME BY THE SOOTHSAYERS PLEADING AS HE HAD BEEN ONCE ALREADY IN THE PAST BUT HE RESISTS HIM STEP BY STEP AT LENGTH HE CAN WITHSTAND HIM NO LONGER AND ON THE PLEA THAT THE HIGHER MAN IS ON HIS GROUND AND THEREFORE UNDER HIS PROTECTION ZARATHUSTRA DEPARTS IN SEARCH OF HIM LEAVING SCHOPENHAUERA HIGHER MAN IN NIETZSCHES OPINIONIN THE CAVE AS A GUEST CHAPTER LXIII TALK WITH THE KINGS ON HIS WAY ZARATHUSTRA MEETS TWO MORE HIGHER MEN OF HIS TIME TWO KINGS CROSS HIS PATH THEY ARE ABOVE THE AVERAGE MODERN TYPE FOR THEIR INSTINCTS TELL THEM WHAT REAL RULING IS AND THEY DESPISE THE MOCKERY WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO CALL REIGNING WE ARE NOT THE FIRST MEN THEY SAY AND HAVE NEVERTHELESS TO STAND FOR THEM OF THIS IMPOSTURE HAVE WE AT LAST BECOME WEARY AND DISGUSTED IT IS THE KINGS WHO TELL ZARATHUSTRA THERE IS NO SORER MISFORTUNE IN ALL HUMAN DESTINY THAN WHEN THE MIGHTY OF THE EARTH ARE NOT ALSO THE FIRST MEN THERE EVERYTHING BECOMETH FALSE AND DISTORTED AND MONSTROUS THE KINGS ARE ALSO ASKED BY ZARATHUSTRA TO ACCEPT THE SHELTER OF HIS CAVE WHEREUPON HE PROCEEDS ON HIS WAY CHAPTER LXIV THE LEECH AMONG THE HIGHER MEN WHOM ZARATHUSTRA WISHES TO SAVE IS ALSO THE SCIENTIFIC SPECIALISTTHE MAN WHO HONESTLY AND SCRUPULOUSLY PURSUES HIS INVESTIGATIONS AS DARWIN DID IN ONE DEPARTMENT OF KNOWLEDGE I LOVE HIM WHO LIVETH IN ORDER TO KNOW AND SEEKETH TO KNOW IN ORDER THAT THE SUPERMAN MAY HEREAFTER LIVE THUS SEEKETH HE HIS OWN DOWNGOING THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE HE IS CALLED IN THIS DISCOURSE ZARATHUSTRA STEPS ON HIM UNAWARES AND THE SLAVE OF SCIENCE BLEEDING FROM THE VIOLENCE HE HAS DONE TO HIMSELF BY HIS SELFIMPOSED TASK SPEAKS PROUDLY OF HIS LITTLE SPHERE OF KNOWLEDGEHIS LITTLE HANDS BREADTH OF GROUND ON ZARATHUSTRAS TERRITORY PHILOSOPHY WHERE MINE HONESTY CEASETH SAYS THE TRUE SCIENTIFIC SPECIALIST THERE AM I BLIND AND WANT ALSO TO BE BLIND WHERE I WANT TO KNOW HOWEVER THERE WANT I ALSO TO BE HONESTNAMELY SEVERE RIGOROUS RESTRICTED CRUEL AND INEXORABLE ZARATHUSTRA GREATLY RESPECTING THIS MAN INVITES HIM TOO TO THE CAVE AND THEN VANISHES IN ANSWER TO ANOTHER CRY FOR HELP CHAPTER LXV THE MAGICIAN THE MAGICIAN IS OF COURSE AN ARTIST AND NIETZSCHES INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF PERHAPS THE GREATEST ARTIST OF HIS AGE RENDERED THE SELECTION OF WAGNER AS THE TYPE IN THIS DISCOURSE ALMOST INEVITABLE MOST READERS WILL BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE FACTS RELATING TO NIETZSCHES AND WAGNERS FRIENDSHIP AND ULTIMATE SEPARATION AS A BOY AND A YOUTH NIETZSCHE HAD SHOWN SUCH A REMARKABLE GIFT FOR MUSIC THAT IT HAD BEEN A QUESTION AT ONE TIME WHETHER HE SHOULD NOT PERHAPS GIVE UP EVERYTHING ELSE IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THIS GIFT BUT HE BECAME A SCHOLAR NOTWITHSTANDING ALTHOUGH HE NEVER ENTIRELY GAVE UP COMPOSING AND PLAYING THE PIANO WHILE STILL IN HIS TEENS HE BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH WAGNERS MUSIC AND GREW PASSIONATELY FOND OF IT LONG BEFORE HE MET WAGNER HE MUST HAVE IDEALISED HIM IN HIS MIND TO AN EXTENT WHICH ONLY A PROFOUNDLY ARTISTIC NATURE COULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF NIETZSCHE ALWAYS HAD HIGH IDEALS FOR HUMANITY IF ONE WERE ASKED WHETHER THROUGHOUT HIS MANY CHANGES THERE WAS YET ONE AIM ONE DIRECTION AND ONE HOPE TO WHICH HE HELD FAST ONE WOULD BE FORCED TO REPLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND DECLARE THAT AIM DIRECTION AND HOPE TO HAVE BEEN THE ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN NOW WHEN NIETZSCHE MET WAGNER HE WAS ACTUALLY CASTING ABOUT FOR AN INCARNATION OF HIS DREAMS FOR THE GERMAN PEOPLE AND WE HAVE ONLY TO REMEMBER HIS YOUTH HE WAS TWENTYONE WHEN HE WAS INTRODUCED TO WAGNER HIS LOVE OF WAGNERS MUSIC AND THE UNDOUBTED POWER OF THE GREAT MUSICIANS PERSONALITY IN ORDER TO REALISE HOW VERY UNCRITICAL HIS ATTITUDE MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST FLOOD OF HIS ENTHUSIASM AGAIN WHEN THE FRIENDSHIP RIPENED WE CANNOT WELL IMAGINE NIETZSCHE THE YOUNGER MAN BEING ANYTHING LESS THAN INTOXICATED BY HIS SENIORS ATTENTION AND LOVE AND WE ARE THEREFORE NOT SURPRISED TO FIND HIM PRESSING WAGNER FORWARD AS THE GREAT REFORMER AND SAVIOUR OF MANKIND WAGNER IN BAYREUTH ENGLISH EDITION GIVES US THE BEST PROOF OF NIETZSCHES INFATUATION AND ALTHOUGH SIGNS ARE NOT WANTING IN THIS ESSAY WHICH SHOW HOW CLEARLY AND EVEN CRUELLY HE WAS SUBCONSCIOUSLY TAKING STOCK OF HIS FRIENDEVEN THEN THE WORK IS A RECORD OF WHAT GREAT LOVE AND ADMIRATION CAN DO IN THE WAY OF ENDOWING THE OBJECT OF ONES AFFECTION WITH ALL THE QUALITIES AND IDEALS THAT A FERTILE IMAGINATION CAN CONCEIVE WHEN THE BLOW CAME IT WAS THEREFORE ALL THE MORE SEVERE NIETZSCHE AT LENGTH REALISED THAT THE FRIEND OF HIS FANCY AND THE REAL RICHARD WAGNERTHE COMPOSER OF PARSIFALWERE NOT ONE THE FACT DAWNED UPON HIM SLOWLY DISAPPOINTMENT UPON DISAPPOINTMENT REVELATION AFTER REVELATION ULTIMATELY BROUGHT IT HOME TO HIM AND THOUGH HIS BEST INSTINCTS WERE NATURALLY OPPOSED TO IT AT FIRST THE REVULSION OF FEELING AT LAST BECAME TOO STRONG TO BE IGNORED AND NIETZSCHE WAS PLUNGED INTO THE BLACKEST DESPAIR YEARS AFTER HIS BREAK WITH WAGNER HE WROTE THE CASE OF WAGNER AND NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER AND THESE WORKS ARE WITH US TO PROVE THE SINCERITY AND DEPTH OF HIS VIEWS ON THE MAN WHO WAS THE GREATEST EVENT OF HIS LIFE THE POEM IN THIS DISCOURSE IS OF COURSE REMINISCENT OF WAGNERS OWN POETICAL MANNER AND IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE WHOLE WAS WRITTEN SUBSEQUENT TO NIETZSCHES FINAL BREAK WITH HIS FRIEND THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN ZARATHUSTRA AND THE MAGICIAN REVEALS PRETTY FULLY WHAT IT WAS THAT NIETZSCHE GREW TO LOATHE SO INTENSELY IN WAGNERVIZ HIS PRONOUNCED HISTRIONIC TENDENCIES HIS DISSEMBLING POWERS HIS INORDINATE VANITY HIS EQUIVOCALNESS HIS FALSENESS IT HONOURETH THEE SAYS ZARATHUSTRA THAT THOU SOUGHTEST FOR GREATNESS BUT IT BETRAYETH THEE ALSO THOU ART NOT GREAT THE MAGICIAN IS NEVERTHELESS SENT AS A GUEST TO ZARATHUSTRAS CAVE FOR IN HIS HEART ZARATHUSTRA BELIEVED UNTIL THE END THAT THE MAGICIAN WAS A HIGHER MAN BROKEN BY MODERN VALUES CHAPTER LXVI OUT OF SERVICE ZARATHUSTRA NOW MEETS THE LAST POPE AND IN A POETICAL FORM WE GET NIETZSCHES DESCRIPTION OF THE COURSE JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY PURSUED BEFORE THEY REACHED THEIR FINAL BREAKUP IN ATHEISM AGNOSTICISM AND THE LIKE THE GOD OF A STRONG WARLIKE RACETHE GOD OF ISRAELIS A JEALOUS REVENGEFUL GOD HE IS A POWER THAT CAN BE PICTURED AND ENDURED ONLY BY A HARDY AND COURAGEOUS RACE A RACE RICH ENOUGH TO SACRIFICE AND TO LOSE IN SACRIFICE THE IMAGE OF THIS GOD DEGENERATES WITH THE PEOPLE THAT APPROPRIATE IT AND GRADUALLY HE BECOMES A GOD OF LOVESOFT AND MELLOW A LOWER MIDDLECLASS DEITY WHO IS PITIFUL HE CAN NO LONGER BE A GOD WHO REQUIRES SACRIFICE FOR WE OURSELVES ARE NO LONGER RICH ENOUGH FOR THAT THE TABLES ARE THEREFORE TURNED UPON HIM HE MUST SACRIFICE TO US HIS PITY BECOMES SO GREAT THAT HE ACTUALLY DOES SACRIFICE SOMETHING TO USHIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON SUCH A PROCESS CARRIED TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS MUST ULTIMATELY END IN HIS OWN DESTRUCTION AND THUS WE FIND THE POPE DECLARING THAT GOD WAS ONE DAY SUFFOCATED BY HIS ALLTOOGREAT PITY WHAT FOLLOWS IS CLEAR ENOUGH ZARATHUSTRA RECOGNISES ANOTHER HIGHER MAN IN THE EXPOPE AND SENDS HIM TOO AS A GUEST TO THE CAVE CHAPTER LXVII THE UGLIEST MAN THIS DISCOURSE CONTAINS PERHAPS THE BOLDEST OF NIETZSCHES SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING ATHEISM AS WELL AS SOME EXTREMELY PENETRATING REMARKS UPON THE SENTIMENT OF PITY ZARATHUSTRA COMES ACROSS THE REPULSIVE CREATURE SITTING ON THE WAYSIDE AND WHAT DOES HE DO HE MANIFESTS THE ONLY CORRECT FEELINGS THAT CAN BE MANIFESTED IN THE PRESENCE OF ANY GREAT MISERYTHAT IS TO SAY SHAME REVERENCE EMBARRASSMENT NIETZSCHE DETESTED THE OBTRUSIVE AND GUSHING PITY THAT GOES UP TO MISERY WITHOUT A BLUSH EITHER ON ITS CHEEK OR IN ITS HEARTTHE PITY WHICH IS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF SELFGLORIFICATION THANK GOD THAT I AM NOT LIKE THEEONLY THIS SELFGLORIFYING SENTIMENT CAN LEND A WELLCONSTITUTED MAN THE IMPUDENCE TO SHOW HIS PITY FOR THE CRIPPLE AND THE ILLCONSTITUTED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE UGLIEST MAN NIETZSCHE BLUSHESHE BLUSHES FOR HIS RACE HIS OWN PARTICULAR KIND OF ALTRUISMTHE ALTRUISM THAT MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED THE EXISTENCE OF THIS MANSTRIKES HIM WITH ALL ITS FORCE HE WILL HAVE THE WORLD OTHERWISE HE WILL HAVE A WORLD WHERE ONE NEED NOT BLUSH FOR ONES FELLOWSHENCE HIS APPEAL TO US TO LOVE ONLY OUR CHILDRENS LAND THE LAND UNDISCOVERED IN THE REMOTEST SEA ZARATHUSTRA CALLS THE UGLIEST MAN THE MURDERER OF GOD CERTAINLY THIS IS ONE ASPECT OF A CERTAIN KIND OF ATHEISMTHE ATHEISM OF THE MAN WHO REVERES BEAUTY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HIS OWN UGLINESS WHICH OUTRAGES HIM MUST BE CONCEALED FROM EVERY EYE LEST IT SHOULD NOT BE RESPECTED AS ZARATHUSTRA RESPECTED IT IF THERE BE A GOD HE TOO MUST BE EVADED HIS PITY MUST BE FOILED BUT GOD IS UBIQUITOUS AND OMNISCIENT THEREFORE FOR THE REALLY GREAT UGLY MAN HE MUST NOT EXIST THEIR PITY IS IT FROM WHICH I FLEE AWAY HE SAYSTHAT IS TO SAY IT IS FROM THEIR WANT OF REVERENCE AND LACK OF SHAME IN PRESENCE OF MY GREAT MISERY THE UGLIEST MAN DESPISES HIMSELF BUT ZARATHUSTRA SAID IN HIS PROLOGUE I LOVE THE GREAT DESPISERS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE GREAT ADORERS AND ARROWS OF LONGING FOR THE OTHER SHORE HE THEREFORE HONOURS THE UGLIEST MAN SEES HEIGHT IN HIS SELFCONTEMPT AND INVITES HIM TO JOIN THE OTHER HIGHER MEN IN THE CAVE CHAPTER LXVIII THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR IN THIS DISCOURSE WE UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE THE IDEAL BUDDHIST IF NOT GAUTAMA BUDDHA HIMSELF NIETZSCHE HAD THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR BUDDHISM AND ALMOST WHEREVER HE REFERS TO IT IN HIS WORKS IT IS IN TERMS OF PRAISE HE RECOGNISED THAT THOUGH BUDDHISM IS UNDOUBTEDLY A RELIGION FOR DECADENTS ITS DECADENT VALUES EMANATE FROM THE HIGHER AND NOT AS IN CHRISTIANITY FROM THE LOWER GRADES OF SOCIETY IN APHORISM OF THE ANTICHRIST HE COMPARES IT EXHAUSTIVELY WITH CHRISTIANITY AND THE RESULT OF HIS INVESTIGATION IS VERY MUCH IN FAVOUR OF THE OLDER RELIGION STILL HE RECOGNISED A MOST DECIDED BUDDHISTIC INFLUENCE IN CHRISTS TEACHING AND THE WORDS IN VERSES AND ARE VERY REMINISCENT OF HIS VIEWS IN REGARD TO THE CHRISTIAN SAVIOR THE FIGURE OF CHRIST HAS BEEN INTRODUCED OFTEN ENOUGH INTO FICTION AND MANY SCHOLARS HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO WRITE HIS LIFE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN LIGHTS BUT FEW PERHAPS HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED TO PRESENT HIM TO US BEREFT OF ALL THOSE CHARACTERISTICS WHICH A LACK OF THE SENSE OF HARMONY HAS ATTACHED TO HIS PERSON THROUGH THE AGES IN WHICH HIS DOCTRINES HAVE BEEN TAUGHT NOW NIETZSCHE DISAGREED ENTIRELY WITH RENANS VIEW THAT CHRIST WAS LE GRAND MAITRE EN IRONIE IN APHORISM OF THE ANTICHRIST HE SAYS THAT HE NIETZSCHE ALWAYS PURGED HIS PICTURE OF THE HUMBLE NAZARENE OF ALL THOSE BITTER AND SPITEFUL OUTBURSTS WHICH IN VIEW OF THE STRUGGLE THE FIRST CHRISTIANS WENT THROUGH MAY VERY WELL HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE ORIGINAL CHARACTER BY APOLOGISTS AND SECTARIANS WHO AT THAT TIME COULD ILL AFFORD TO CONSIDER NICE PSYCHOLOGICAL POINTS SEEING THAT WHAT THEY NEEDED ABOVE ALL WAS A WRANGLING AND ABUSIVE DEITY THESE TWO CONFLICTING HALVES IN THE CHARACTER OF THE CHRIST OF THE GOSPELS WHICH NO SOUND PSYCHOLOGY CAN EVER RECONCILE NIETZSCHE ALWAYS KEPT DISTINCT IN HIS OWN MIND HE COULD NOT CREDIT THE SAME MAN WITH SENTIMENTS SOMETIMES SO NOBLE AND AT OTHER TIMES SO VULGAR AND IN PRESENTING US WITH THIS NEW PORTRAIT OF THE SAVIOUR PURGED OF ALL IMPURITIES NIETZSCHE RENDERED MILITARY HONOURS TO A FOE WHICH FAR EXCEED IN WORTH ALL THAT HIS MOST ARDENT DISCIPLES HAVE EVER CLAIMED FOR HIM IN VERSE WE ARE VIVIDLY REMINDED OF HERBERT SPENCERS WORDS LE MARIAGE DE CONVENANCE IS LEGALISED PROSTITUTION CHAPTER LXIX THE SHADOW HERE WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THAT COURAGEOUS AND WAYWARD SPIRIT THAT LITERALLY HAUNTS THE FOOTSTEPS OF EVERY GREAT THINKER AND EVERY GREAT LEADER SOMETIMES WITH THE RESULT THAT IT LOSES ALL AIMS ALL HOPES AND ALL TRUST IN A DEFINITE GOAL IT IS THE CASE OF THE BRAVEST AND MOST BROADMINDED MEN OF TODAY THESE LITERALLY SHADOW THE MOST DARING MOVEMENTS IN THE SCIENCE AND ART OF THEIR GENERATION THEY COMPLETELY LOSE THEIR BEARINGS AND ACTUALLY FIND THEMSELVES IN THE END WITHOUT A WAY A GOAL OR A HOME ON EVERY SURFACE HAVE I ALREADY SATI BECOME THIN I AM ALMOST EQUAL TO A SHADOW AT LAST IN DESPAIR SUCH MEN DO INDEED CRY OUT NOTHING IS TRUE ALL IS PERMITTED AND THEN THEY BECOME MERE WRECKAGE TOO MUCH HATH BECOME CLEAR UNTO ME NOW NOTHING MATTERETH TO ME ANY MORE NOTHING LIVETH ANY LONGER THAT I LOVEHOW SHOULD I STILL LOVE MYSELF HAVE I STILL A GOAL WHERE IS MY HOME ZARATHUSTRA REALISES THE DANGER THREATENING SUCH A MAN THY DANGER IS NOT SMALL THOU FREE SPIRIT AND WANDERER HE SAYS THOU HAST HAD A BAD DAY SEE THAT A STILL WORSE EVENING DOTH NOT OVERTAKE THEE THE DANGER ZARATHUSTRA REFERS TO IS PRECISELY THIS THAT EVEN A PRISON MAY SEEM A BLESSING TO SUCH A MAN AT LEAST THE BARS KEEP HIM IN A PLACE OF REST A PLACE OF CONFINEMENT AT ITS WORST IS REAL BEWARE LEST IN THE END A NARROW FAITH CAPTURE THEE SAYS ZARATHUSTRA FOR NOW EVERYTHING THAT IS NARROW AND FIXED SEDUCETH AND TEMPTETH THEE CHAPTER LXX NOONTIDE AT THE NOON OF LIFE NIETZSCHE SAID HE ENTERED THE WORLD WITH HIM MAN CAME OF AGE WE ARE NOW HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS OUR OLD GUARDIANS THE GODS AND DEMIGODS OF OUR YOUTH THE SUPERSTITIONS AND FEARS OF OUR CHILDHOOD WITHDRAW THE FIELD LIES OPEN BEFORE US WE LIVED THROUGH OUR MORNING WITH BUT ONE MASTERCHANCE LET US SEE TO IT THAT WE MAKE OUR AFTERNOON OUR OWN SEE NOTE XLIX PART III CHAPTER LXXI THE GREETING HERE I THINK I MAY CLAIM THAT MY CONTENTION IN REGARD TO THE PURPOSE AND AIM OF THE WHOLE OF NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY AS STATED AT THE BEGINNING OF MY NOTES ON PART IV IS COMPLETELY UPHELD HE FOUGHT FOR ALL WHO DO NOT WANT TO LIVE UNLESS THEY LEARN AGAIN TO HOPEUNLESS THEY LEARN FROM HIM THE GREAT HOPE ZARATHUSTRAS ADDRESS TO HIS GUESTS SHOWS CLEARLY ENOUGH HOW HE WISHED TO HELP THEM I DO NOT TREAT MY WARRIORS INDULGENTLY HE SAYS HOW THEN COULD YE BE FIT FOR MY WARFARE HE REBUKES AND SPURNS THEM NO WORD OF LOVE COMES FROM HIS LIPS ELSEWHERE HE SAYS A MAN SHOULD BE A HARD BED TO HIS FRIEND THUS ALONE CAN HE BE OF USE TO HIM NIETZSCHE WOULD BE A HARD BED TO HIGHER MEN HE WOULD MAKE THEM HARDER FOR IN ORDER TO BE A LAW UNTO HIMSELF MAN MUST POSSESS THE REQUISITE HARDNESS I WAIT FOR HIGHER ONES STRONGER ONES MORE TRIUMPHANT ONES MERRIER ONES FOR SUCH AS ARE BUILT SQUARELY IN BODY AND SOUL HE SAYS IN PAR OF HIGHER MAN YE HIGHER MEN THINK YE THAT I AM HERE TO PUT RIGHT WHAT YE HAVE PUT WRONG OR THAT I WISHED HENCEFORTH TO MAKE SNUGGER COUCHES FOR YOU SUFFERERS OR SHOW YOU RESTLESS MISWANDERING MISCLIMBING ONES NEW AND EASIER FOOTPATHS NAY NAY THREE TIMES NAY ALWAYS MORE ALWAYS BETTER ONES OF YOUR TYPE SHALL SUCCUMBFOR YE SHALL ALWAYS HAVE IT WORSE AND HARDER CHAPTER LXXII THE SUPPER IN THE FIRST SEVEN VERSES OF THIS DISCOURSE I CANNOT HELP SEEING A GENTLE ALLUSION TO SCHOPENHAUERS HABITS AS A BONVIVANT FOR A PESSIMIST BE IT REMEMBERED SCHOPENHAUER LED QUITE AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE HE ATE WELL LOVED WELL PLAYED THE FLUTE WELL AND I BELIEVE HE SMOKED THE BEST CIGARS WHAT FOLLOWS IS CLEAR ENOUGH CHAPTER LXXIII THE HIGHER MAN PAR NIETZSCHE ADMITS HERE THAT AT ONE TIME HE HAD THOUGHT OF APPEALING TO THE PEOPLE TO THE CROWD IN THE MARKETPLACE BUT THAT HE HAD ULTIMATELY TO ABANDON THE TASK HE BIDS HIGHER MEN DEPART FROM THE MARKETPLACE PAR HERE WE ARE TOLD QUITE PLAINLY WHAT CLASS OF MEN ACTUALLY OWE ALL THEIR IMPULSES AND DESIRES TO THE INSTINCT OF SELFPRESERVATION THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IS INDEED THE ONLY SPUR IN THE CASE OF SUCH PEOPLE TO THEM IT MATTERS NOT IN WHAT SHAPE OR CONDITION MAN BE PRESERVED PROVIDED ONLY HE SURVIVE THE TRANSCENDENTAL MAXIM THAT LIFE PER SE IS PRECIOUS IS THE RULING MAXIM HERE PAR IN THE NOTE ON CHAPTER LVII END I SPEAK OF NIETZSCHES ELEVATION OF THE VIRTUE COURAGE TO THE HIGHEST PLACE AMONG THE VIRTUES HERE HE TELLS HIGHER MEN THE CLASS OF COURAGE HE EXPECTS FROM THEM PARS THESE HAVE ALREADY BEEN REFERRED TO IN THE NOTES ON CHAPTERS LVII END AND LXXI PAR I SUGGEST THAT THE LAST VERSE IN THIS PARAGRAPH STRONGLY CONFIRMS THE VIEW THAT NIETZSCHES TEACHING WAS ALWAYS MEANT BY HIM TO BE ESOTERIC AND FOR HIGHER MAN ALONE PAR IN THE LAST VERSE HERE ANOTHER SHAFT OF LIGHT IS THROWN UPON THE IMMACULATE PERCEPTION OR SOCALLED PURE OBJECTIVITY OF THE SCIENTIFIC MIND FREEDOM FROM FEVER IS STILL FAR FROM BEING KNOWLEDGE WHERE A MANS EMOTIONS CEASE TO ACCOMPANY HIM IN HIS INVESTIGATIONS HE IS NOT NECESSARILY NEARER THE TRUTH SAYS SPENCER IN THE PREFACE TO HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHYIN THE GENESIS OF A SYSTEM OF THOUGHT THE EMOTIONAL NATURE IS A LARGE FACTOR PERHAPS AS LARGE A FACTOR AS THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE SEE PAGES OF VOL I THOUGHTS OUT OF SEASON PARS WHEN WE APPROACH NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY WE MUST BE PREPARED TO BE INDEPENDENT THINKERS IN FACT THE GREATEST VIRTUE OF HIS WORKS IS PERHAPS THE SUBTLETY WITH WHICH THEY IMPOSE THE OBLIGATION UPON ONE OF THINKING ALONE OF SCORING OFF ONES OWN BAT AND OF SHIFTING INTELLECTUALLY FOR ONESELF PAR I AM A RAILING ALONGSIDE THE TORRENT WHOEVER IS ABLE TO GRASP ME MAY GRASP ME YOUR CRUTCH HOWEVER I AM NOT THESE TWO PARAGRAPHS ARE AN EXHORTATION TO HIGHER MEN TO BECOME INDEPENDENT PAR HERE NIETZSCHE PERHAPS EXAGGERATES THE IMPORTANCE OF HEREDITY AS HOWEVER THE QUESTION IS BY NO MEANS ONE ON WHICH WE ARE ALL AGREED WHAT HE SAYS IS NOT WITHOUT VALUE A VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN NIETZSCHES PHILOSOPHY IS ENUNCIATED IN THE FIRST VERSE OF THIS PARAGRAPH THE HIGHER ITS TYPE ALWAYS THE SELDOMER DOTH A THING SUCCEED SEE PAGE OF BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL THOSE WHO LIKE SOME POLITICAL ECONOMISTS TALK IN A BUSINESSLIKE WAY ABOUT THE TERRIFIC WASTE OF HUMAN LIFE AND ENERGY DELIBERATELY OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT THE WASTE MOST TO BE DEPLORED USUALLY OCCURS AMONG HIGHER INDIVIDUALS ECONOMY WAS NEVER PRECISELY ONE OF NATURES LEADING PRINCIPLES ALL THIS SENTIMENTAL WAILING OVER THE LARGER PROPORTION OF FAILURES THAN SUCCESSES IN HUMAN LIFE DOES NOT SEEM TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT IT IS THE RAREST THING ON EARTH FOR A HIGHLY ORGANISED BEING TO ATTAIN TO THE FULLEST DEVELOPMENT AND ACTIVITY OF ALL ITS FUNCTIONS SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS SO HIGHLY ORGANISED THE BLIND WILL TO POWER IN NATURE THEREFORE STANDS IN URGENT NEED OF DIRECTION BY MAN PARS THESE PARAGRAPHS DEAL WITH NIETZSCHES PROTEST AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC SERIOUSNESS POBELERNST OF MODERN TIMES ALL GOOD THINGS LAUGH HE SAYS AND HIS FINAL COMMAND TO THE HIGHER MEN IS LEARN I PRAY YOUTO LAUGH ALL THAT IS GOOD IN NIETZSCHES SENSE IS CHEERFUL TO BE ABLE TO CRACK A JOKE ABOUT ONES DEEPEST FEELINGS IS THE GREATEST TEST OF THEIR VALUE THE MAN WHO DOES NOT LAUGH LIKE THE MAN WHO DOES NOT MAKE FACES IS ALREADY A BUFFOON AT HEART WHAT HATH HITHERTO BEEN THE GREATEST SIN HERE ON EARTH WAS IT NOT THE WORD OF HIM WHO SAID WOE UNTO THEM THAT LAUGH NOW DID HE HIMSELF FIND NO CAUSE FOR LAUGHTER ON THE EARTH THEN HE SOUGHT BADLY A CHILD EVEN FINDETH CAUSE FOR IT CHAPTER LXXIV THE SONG OF MELANCHOLY AFTER HIS ADDRESS TO THE HIGHER MEN ZARATHUSTRA GOES OUT INTO THE OPEN TO RECOVER HIMSELF MEANWHILE THE MAGICIAN WAGNER SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY IN ORDER TO DRAW THEM ALL INTO HIS NET ONCE MORE SINGS THE SONG OF MELANCHOLY CHAPTER LXXV SCIENCE THE ONLY ONE TO RESIST THE MELANCHOLY VOLUPTUOUSNESS OF HIS ART IS THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONETHE SCIENTIFIC SPECIALIST OF WHOM WE READ IN THE DISCOURSE ENTITLED THE LEECH HE TAKES THE HARP FROM THE MAGICIAN AND CRIES FOR AIR WHILE REPROVING THE MUSICIAN IN THE STYLE OF THE CASE OF WAGNER WHEN THE MAGICIAN RETALIATES BY SAYING THAT THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE COULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD LITTLE OF HIS SONG THE LATTER REPLIES THOU PRAISEST ME IN THAT THOU SEPARATEST ME FROM THYSELF THE SPEECH OF THE SCIENTIFIC MAN TO HIS FELLOW HIGHER MEN IS WELL WORTH STUDYING BY MEANS OF IT NIETZSCHE PAYS A HIGH TRIBUTE TO THE HONESTY OF THE TRUE SPECIALIST WHILE IN REPRESENTING HIM AS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN RESIST THE DEMONIACAL INFLUENCE OF THE MAGICIANS MUSIC HE ELEVATES HIM AT A STROKE ABOVE ALL THOSE PRESENT ZARATHUSTRA AND THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE JOIN ISSUE AT THE END ON THE QUESTION OF THE PROPER PLACE OF FEAR IN MANS HISTORY AND NIETZSCHE AVAILS HIMSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITY IN ORDER TO RESTATE HIS VIEWS CONCERNING THE RELATION OF COURAGE TO HUMANITY IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE COURAGE HAS PLAYED THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IN OUR DEVELOPMENT THAT HE WOULD NOT SEE IT VANISH FROM AMONG OUR VIRTUES TODAY COURAGE SEEMETH TO ME THE ENTIRE PRIMITIVE HISTORY OF MAN CHAPTER LXXVI AMONG THE DAUGHTERS OF THE DESERT THIS TELLS ITS OWN TALE CHAPTER LXXVII THE AWAKENING IN THIS DISCOURSE NIETZSCHE WISHES TO GIVE HIS FOLLOWERS A WARNING HE THINKS HE HAS SO FAR HELPED THEM THAT THEY HAVE BECOME CONVALESCENT THAT NEW DESIRES ARE AWAKENED IN THEM AND THAT NEW HOPES ARE IN THEIR ARMS AND LEGS BUT HE MISTAKES THE NATURE OF THE CHANGE TRUE HE HAS HELPED THEM HE HAS GIVEN THEM BACK WHAT THEY MOST NEED IE BELIEF IN BELIEVINGTHE CONFIDENCE IN HAVING CONFIDENCE IN SOMETHING BUT HOW DO THEY USE IT THIS BELIEF IN FAITH IF ONE CAN SO EXPRESS IT WITHOUT SEEMING TAUTOLOGICAL HAS CERTAINLY BEEN RESTORED TO THEM AND IN THE FIRST FLOOD OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM THEY USE IT BY BOWING DOWN AND WORSHIPPING AN ASS WHEN WRITING THIS PASSAGE NIETZSCHE WAS OBVIOUSLY THINKING OF THE ACCUSATIONS WHICH WERE LEVELLED AT THE EARLY CHRISTIANS BY THEIR PAGAN CONTEMPORARIES IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED NOT ONLY TO BE EATERS OF HUMAN FLESH BUT ALSO ASSWORSHIPPERS AND AMONG THE ROMAN GRAFFITI THE MOST FAMOUS IS THE ONE FOUND ON THE PALATINO SHOWING A MAN WORSHIPPING A CROSS ON WHICH IS SUSPENDED A FIGURE WITH THE HEAD OF AN ASS SEE MINUCIUS FELIX OCTAVIUS IX TACITUS HISTORIAE V TERTULLIAN APOLOGIA ETC NIETZSCHES OBVIOUS MORAL HOWEVER IS THAT GREAT SCIENTISTS AND THINKERS ONCE THEY HAVE REACHED THE WALL ENCIRCLING SCEPTICISM AND HAVE THEREBY LEARNED TO RECOVER THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE ACT OF BELIEVING AS SUCH USUALLY MANIFEST THE CHANGE IN THEIR OUTLOOK BY FALLING VICTIMS TO THE NARROWEST AND MOST SUPERSTITIOUS OF CREEDS SO MUCH FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ASS AS AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP NOW WITH REGARD TO THE ACTUAL SERVICE AND ASSFESTIVAL NO READER WHO HAPPENS TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE RELIGIOUS HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE AGES WILL FAIL TO SEE THE ALLUSION HERE TO THE ASINARIA FESTA WHICH WERE BY NO MEANS UNCOMMON IN FRANCE GERMANY AND ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE DURING THE THIRTEENTH FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES CHAPTER LXXVIII THE ASSFESTIVAL AT LENGTH IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR FEAST ZARATHUSTRA BURSTS IN UPON THEM AND REBUKES THEM SOUNDLY BUT HE DOES NOT DO SO LONG IN THE ASSFESTIVAL IT SUDDENLY OCCURS TO HIM THAT HE IS CONCERNED WITH A CEREMONY THAT MAY NOT BE WITHOUT ITS PURPOSE AS SOMETHING FOOLISH BUT NECESSARYA RECREATION FOR WISE MEN HE IS THEREFORE HIGHLY PLEASED THAT THE HIGHER MEN HAVE ALL BLOSSOMED FORTH THEY THEREFORE REQUIRE NEW FESTIVALSA LITTLE VALIANT NONSENSE SOME DIVINE SERVICE AND ASSFESTIVAL SOME OLD JOYFUL ZARATHUSTRA FOOL SOME BLUSTERER TO BLOW THEIR SOULS BRIGHT HE TELLS THEM NOT TO FORGET THAT NIGHT AND THE ASSFESTIVAL FOR SUCH THINGS ONLY THE CONVALESCENT DEVISE AND SHOULD YE CELEBRATE IT AGAIN HE CONCLUDES DO IT FROM LOVE TO YOURSELVES DO IT ALSO FROM LOVE TO ME AND IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME CHAPTER LXXIX THE DRUNKEN SONG IT WERE THE HEIGHT OF PRESUMPTION TO ATTEMPT TO FIX ANY PARTICULAR INTERPRETATION OF MY OWN TO THE WORDS OF THIS SONG WITH WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE THE READER WHILE READING IT AS POETRY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEEK AND FIND HIS OWN MEANING IN IT THE DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNAL RECURRENCE APPEARS FOR THE LAST TIME HERE IN AN ARTFORM NIETZSCHE LAYS STRESS UPON THE FACT THAT ALL HAPPINESS ALL DELIGHT LONGS FOR REPETITIONS AND JUST AS A CHILD CRIES AGAIN AGAIN TO THE ADULT WHO HAPPENS TO BE AMUSING HIM SO THE MAN WHO SEES A MEANING AND A JOYFUL MEANING IN EXISTENCE MUST ALSO CRY AGAIN AND YET AGAIN TO ALL HIS LIFE CHAPTER LXXX THE SIGN IN THIS DISCOURSE NIETZSCHE DISASSOCIATES HIMSELF FINALLY FROM THE HIGHER MEN AND BY THE SYMBOL OF THE LION WISHES TO CONVEY TO US THAT HE HAS WON OVER AND MASTERED THE BEST AND THE MOST TERRIBLE IN NATURE THAT GREAT POWER AND TENDERNESS ARE KIN WAS ALREADY HIS BELIEF IN EIGHT YEARS BEFORE HE WROTE THIS SPEECH AND WHEN THE BIRDS AND THE LION COME TO HIM IT IS BECAUSE HE IS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TWO QUALITIES ALL THAT IS TERRIBLE AND GREAT IN NATURE THE HIGHER MEN ARE NOT YET PREPARED FOR FOR THEY RETREAT HORRORSTRICKEN INTO THE CAVE WHEN THE LION SPRINGS AT THEM BUT ZARATHUSTRA MAKES NOT A MOVE TOWARDS THEM HE WAS TEMPTED TO THEM ON THE PREVIOUS DAY HE SAYS BUT THAT HATH HAD ITS TIME MY SUFFERING AND MY FELLOW SUFFERINGWHAT MATTER ABOUT THEM DO I THEN STRIVE AFTER HAPPINESS I STRIVE AFTER MY WORK WELL THE LION HATH COME MY CHILDREN ARE NIGH ZARATHUSTRA HATH GROWN RIPE MY DAY BEGINNETH ARISE NOW ARISE THOU GREAT NOONDAY THE ABOVE I KNOW TO BE OPEN TO MUCH CRITICISM I SHALL BE GRATEFUL TO ALL THOSE WHO WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO SHOW ME WHERE AND HOW I HAVE GONE WRONG BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT AS THEY STAND I HAVE NOT GIVEN TO THESE NOTES BY ANY MEANS THEIR FINAL FORM ANTHONY M LUDOVICI LONDON FEBRUARY END OF PROJECT GUTENBERGS
